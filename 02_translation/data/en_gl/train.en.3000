J@@ ust to put everything in con@@ text , and to kind of give you a bac@@ k@@ ground to where I &apos;m coming from , so that a lot of the things I &apos;m going to say , and the things I &apos;m going to do — or things I &apos;m going to tell you I &apos;ve done — you will understand exactly why and how I got mo@@ tiv@@ ated to be where I am .
And just like my parents did when they fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed stud@@ ying ab@@ ro@@ ad , we went back home .
Fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed uni@@ versi@@ ty education , got a medical de@@ gre@@ e , 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
And by the time I was an inter@@ n house of@@ fi@@ cer , I could bar@@ e@@ ly af@@ for@@ d to ma@@ in@@ tain my mother &apos;s 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year@@ -old car — and I was a pa@@ id doc@@ tor .
This br@@ ings us to why a lot of us , who are profes@@ sion@@ als , are now , as they say , in di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
Now , are we going to make that a per@@ man@@ ent thing , where we all get tra@@ in@@ ed , and we lea@@ ve , and we don &apos;t go back ?
Per@@ haps not , I should cer@@ tain@@ ly hope not — because that is not my vi@@ sion .
All right , for good meas@@ ure , that &apos;s where N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia is on the A@@ fri@@ can ma@@ p , and just there is the D@@ el@@ ta re@@ gi@@ on that I &apos;m sure every@@ body &apos;s heard of .
People getting ki@@ d@@ na@@ p@@ ped , where the oil comes from , the oil that sometimes I think has dri@@ ven us all cra@@ z@@ y in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
V@@ er@@ y interesting .
How many people do you think are on that ta@@ x@@ i ?
And believe it or not , that is a ta@@ x@@ i in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
And the ca@@ pi@@ tal — well , what used to be the ca@@ pi@@ tal of N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia — L@@ ag@@ os , that &apos;s a ta@@ x@@ i , and you have poli@@ ce on them .
So , tell me , how many poli@@ ce@@ men do you think are on this ta@@ x@@ i ? And now ? Th@@ ree .
So , when these kind of people — and , believe me , it &apos;s not just the poli@@ ce that use these ta@@ x@@ is in L@@ ag@@ os . We all do . I &apos;ve been on one of these , and I didn &apos;t have a hel@@ me@@ t , ei@@ ther .
And it just re@@ min@@ ds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a ta@@ x@@ i like this fal@@ ls off , has an ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent and nee@@ ds a hospital .
Be@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , some of us do sur@@ vi@@ ve .
So@@ me of us do sur@@ vi@@ ve mal@@ aria ; we do sur@@ vi@@ ve A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
And she &apos;s right . E@@ very time you go there , you know that if you actually need cri@@ tical care — cri@@ tical care of any sort — if you have an ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent — of which there are many , there are ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents every@@ where — where do they go ?
Wh@@ ere do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ?
I &apos;m not saying instead of , I &apos;m saying as well as , A@@ I@@ D@@ S , T@@ B , mal@@ aria , ty@@ p@@ ho@@ id — the li@@ st goes on .
I &apos;m saying , where do they go when they &apos;re like me ?
When I go back home — and I do all kinds of things , I te@@ ach , I tra@@ in — but I ca@@ t@@ ch one of these things , or I &apos;m ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally ill with one of those , where do they go ?
What &apos;s the econo@@ mic impac@@ t when one of them dies or be@@ comes di@@ sab@@ led ?
I think it &apos;s quite signifi@@ can@@ t . This is where they go .
These are not old pic@@ tures and these are not from some do@@ w@@ n@@ tro@@ d@@ den — this is a ma@@ j@@ or hospital . In fact , it &apos;s from a ma@@ j@@ or teach@@ ing hospital in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
Now that is less than a year old , in an oper@@ ating room .
That &apos;s ster@@ ili@@ zing equi@@ p@@ ment in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
You remember all that oil ?
Y@@ es , I &apos;m sor@@ ry if it u@@ p@@ se@@ ts some of you , but I think you need to see this . That &apos;s the flo@@ or , O@@ K ?
You can say some of this is education .
I &apos;m saying we need more than just , you know , vac@@ cin@@ ation , mal@@ aria , A@@ I@@ D@@ S , because I want to be tre@@ ated in a pro@@ per hospital if something happens to me out there .
And that &apos;s my speci@@ al@@ ty , right ?
An@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ o@@ logy and cri@@ tical care — look at that ba@@ g .
It &apos;s been ta@@ ped with ta@@ pe that we even st@@ op@@ ped using in the U.@@ K@@ .
And believe me , these are cur@@ r@@ ent pic@@ tures .
Now , if something like this , which has happened in the U.@@ K@@ . , that &apos;s where they go . This is the inten@@ sive care un@@ it in which I work .
All right , this is a sli@@ de from a talk I ga@@ ve about inten@@ sive care un@@ its in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia , and jo@@ k@@ ing@@ ly we ref@@ er to it as &quot; &quot; Ex@@ pen@@ sive S@@ care . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y and it &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ sive , but we need to have it , O@@ K ?
So , these are the problems .
There are no pri@@ z@@ es for telling us what the problems are , are there ?
I think we all know . And se@@ ver@@ al spe@@ a@@ kers before and spe@@ a@@ kers after me are going to tell us even more problems .
These are a few of them . So , what did I do ?
There we go — we &apos;re going on a mis@@ sion .
J@@ ust so you know , I do believe in mis@@ si@@ ons , I do believe in a@@ id and I do believe in char@@ ity . They have their place , but where do they go for those things we tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er ?
Because it &apos;s not everyone that &apos;s going to ben@@ ef@@ it from a mis@@ sion .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th is we@@ al@@ th , in the words of H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling .
You get we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er fas@@ ter if you are health@@ y first .
So , here we are , mis@@ sion . B@@ i@@ g t@@ rou@@ ble .
O@@ pen@@ -@@ heart sur@@ ger@@ y in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia — big t@@ rou@@ ble .
That &apos;s Mi@@ ke , Mi@@ ke comes out from M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i .
D@@ o@@ es he look like he &apos;s happ@@ y ?
It took us two days just to organi@@ ze the place , but h@@ ey , you know , we worked on it . D@@ o@@ es he look happ@@ y ?
Y@@ es , let &apos;s just go work this thing out .
Se@@ e , that &apos;s one of the problems we have in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia and in Africa gener@@ ally .
We get a lot of don@@ ated equi@@ p@@ ment .
E@@ qui@@ p@@ ment that &apos;s ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , equi@@ p@@ ment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fi@@ x it . And there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
But we had problems with it . We had se@@ ver@@ e problems there .
He had to get on the ph@@ one . This guy was always on the ph@@ one .
So what we going to do now ?
The reason I have this picture here , this X@@ -@@ ra@@ y , it &apos;s just to tell you where and how we were vie@@ wing X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys .
D@@ o you figur@@ e where that is ? It was on a win@@ do@@ w .
I mean , what &apos;s an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y vie@@ wing bo@@ x ? P@@ le@@ ase .
Well , no@@ wa@@ days everything &apos;s on P@@ A@@ X any@@ way .
You look at your X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys on a s@@ cre@@ en and you do stuff with them , you e@@ mai@@ l them . But we were still using X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , but we didn &apos;t even have a vie@@ wing bo@@ x !
People still believe in V@@ oo@@ do@@ o . H@@ ear@@ t disease , V@@ S@@ D , ho@@ le in the heart , te@@ tr@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es .
You still get people who believe in it and they came .
A@@ t 6@@ 7 percent o@@ x@@ y@@ gen sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ tion , the normal is about 9@@ 7 .
H@@ er condi@@ tion , op@@ en@@ -@@ heart sur@@ ger@@ y that as she re@@ qui@@ red , would have been tre@@ ated when she was a child .
We had to do these for adul@@ ts . So , we did suc@@ ce@@ ed and we still do .
We &apos;ve done three . We &apos;re plan@@ ning another one in J@@ u@@ ly in the nor@@ th of the country . So , we cer@@ tain@@ ly still do op@@ en@@ -@@ heart , but you can see the contra@@ st between everything that was shi@@ p@@ ped in — we ship everything , instru@@ ments . We had ex@@ p@@ lo@@ si@@ ons because the k@@ it was desig@@ ned and inst@@ al@@ led by people who wer@@ en &apos;t used to it .
The o@@ x@@ y@@ gen tan@@ ks didn &apos;t quite work right .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
This is what I mean about appro@@ pri@@ ate technology .
That &apos;s what he was doing , pro@@ p@@ ping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
Ha@@ ve you seen one of those before ?
No ? Y@@ es ? D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter , it worked .
This one &apos;s so@@ le ai@@ m is to pro@@ vi@@ de the very things that I think are mis@@ sing .
So , we put my hand in my po@@ c@@ ket and say , &quot; &quot; Gu@@ ys , let &apos;s just bu@@ y stuff .
Let &apos;s go set up a comp@@ any that teach@@ es people , edu@@ ca@@ tes them , gi@@ ves them the to@@ ols they need to keep going . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s a perfec@@ t example of one .
If you &apos;re in America and you don &apos;t know about this one , we do , because we make it our du@@ ty to find out what &apos;s appro@@ pri@@ ate technology for Africa — what &apos;s appro@@ pri@@ ately pri@@ ced , does the job , and we move on . An@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ a mach@@ ine : multi@@ -@@ par@@ a@@ me@@ ter mon@@ it@@ or , oper@@ ating li@@ ghts , suc@@ tion .
This little un@@ it here — remember your little 1@@ 2@@ -@@ vol@@ t p@@ lu@@ g in the car , that char@@ ges your , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver , G@@ ame Bo@@ y , tele@@ ph@@ one ?
That &apos;s exactly how the out@@ le@@ ts are desig@@ ned .
Y@@ es , it will take a solar pan@@ el . Y@@ es a solar pan@@ el will char@@ ge it .
But if you &apos;ve got ma@@ ins as well , it will char@@ ge the bat@@ teri@@ es in there .
And gu@@ ess what ? We have a little pe@@ da@@ l char@@ ger too , just in case .
And gu@@ ess what , if it all fa@@ il@@ s , if you can find a car that &apos;s still got a live bat@@ ter@@ y and you stic@@ k it in , it will still work . Then you can cu@@ sto@@ mi@@ ze it .
I@@ s it den@@ tal sur@@ ger@@ y you want ? G@@ ener@@ al sur@@ ger@@ y you want ?
De@@ ci@@ de which instru@@ ments , sto@@ ck it up with consu@@ ma@@ bles .
And cur@@ r@@ ently we &apos;re working on o@@ x@@ y@@ gen — o@@ x@@ y@@ gen de@@ li@@ very on-@@ si@@ te .
If you take n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen out , what &apos;s left ? O@@ x@@ y@@ gen , pretty much .
So that &apos;s not new . What we &apos;re doing is ap@@ pl@@ ying this technology to it .
These are the ba@@ sic fe@@ atur@@ es of my devi@@ ce , or our devi@@ ce .
This is what makes it so spe@@ cial .
A@@ part from the a@@ war@@ ds it &apos;s w@@ on , it &apos;s por@@ table and it &apos;s cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed . It &apos;s re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed , the M@@ H@@ R@@ A — and the C@@ E mar@@ k , for those who don &apos;t know , for Europe , is the equi@@ val@@ ent of the F@@ D@@ A in the U.@@ S@@ .
If you compar@@ e it with what &apos;s on the mar@@ ket , pri@@ ce@@ -@@ wi@@ se , si@@ z@@ e@@ -@@ wi@@ se , e@@ ase of use , comple@@ x@@ ity ...
This picture was ta@@ ken last year .
These are me@@ mb@@ ers of my gra@@ du@@ ating cla@@ ss , 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
It was in this g@@ ent@@ le@@ man &apos;s house in the P@@ ot@@ o@@ ma@@ c , for those of you who are famili@@ ar with Mar@@ y@@ land .
There are too many of us out@@ side and every@@ body , just to bor@@ row a bit from H@@ ans — H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , he &apos;s my guy — if the size of the text repres@@ ents what gets the most attention , it &apos;s the problems . But what we really need are A@@ fri@@ can solu@@ tions that are appro@@ pri@@ ate for Africa — looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they &apos;ve got .
A@@ fri@@ can people , because they will do it with a pas@@ sion , I hope .
And l@@ ots and l@@ ots of that little bit down there , sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce .
You have to do it . A@@ fri@@ can@@ s have to do it , in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with everyone else .
Thank you .
You might he@@ ar it like secon@@ d-@@ hand s@@ mo@@ ke at the a@@ ir@@ port ...
And it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
I was cla@@ p@@ ping . They were cla@@ p@@ ping .
Thank you , th@@ ank you .
We see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
And see@@ ing with the brain is of@@ ten called imag@@ in@@ ation .
And we are famili@@ ar with the lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es of our own imag@@ in@@ ation , our in@@ s@@ cap@@ es . We &apos;ve li@@ ved with them all our lives .
But there are also hallucin@@ ations as well , and hallucin@@ ations are comple@@ tely different .
They don &apos;t see@@ m to be of our cre@@ ation .
They don &apos;t see@@ m to be under our control .
They see@@ m to come from the out@@ side , and to mi@@ mic per@@ cep@@ tion .
So I am going to be talking about hallucin@@ ations , and a particular sort of visual hallucin@@ ation which I see a@@ mon@@ g my patients .
A few months ago , I got a ph@@ one call from a n@@ ur@@ sing home where I work .
They told me that one of their res@@ id@@ ents , an old la@@ dy in her 9@@ 0@@ s , was see@@ ing things , and they wonder@@ ed if she &apos;d g@@ one bon@@ kers or , because she was an old la@@ dy , whether she &apos;d had a st@@ ro@@ ke , or whether she had Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s .
And so they asked me if I would come and see R@@ os@@ ali@@ e , the old la@@ dy .
I went in to see her .
It was evi@@ d@@ ent stra@@ ight away that she was perfec@@ tly san@@ e and lu@@ ci@@ d and of good inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce , but she &apos;d been very star@@ t@@ led and very be@@ w@@ il@@ der@@ ed , because she &apos;d been see@@ ing things .
And she told me — the n@@ ur@@ ses ha@@ dn &apos;t men@@ tion@@ ed this — that she was b@@ lin@@ d , that she had been comple@@ tely b@@ lin@@ d from mac@@ ular de@@ gener@@ ation for five years .
But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been see@@ ing things .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What sort of things ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; People in E@@ a@@ ster@@ n d@@ ress , in dra@@ pes , wal@@ king up and down sta@@ ir@@ s .
A man who tur@@ ns to@@ war@@ ds me and s@@ miles .
But he has hu@@ ge te@@ e@@ th on one side of his m@@ outh .
An@@ im@@ als too .
I see a whi@@ te buil@@ ding . It &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing , a so@@ ft s@@ now .
I see this hor@@ se with a har@@ ness , dra@@ gg@@ ing the s@@ now away .
Then , one ni@@ ght , the s@@ cen@@ e chan@@ ges .
I see ca@@ ts and do@@ gs wal@@ king to@@ war@@ ds me .
They come to a cer@@ tain point and then stop .
Then it chan@@ ges again .
I see a lot of children . They are wal@@ king up and down sta@@ ir@@ s .
They we@@ ar b@@ right col@@ ors , ro@@ se and blue , like E@@ a@@ ster@@ n d@@ ress . &quot; &quot; So@@ me@@ times , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucin@@ ate p@@ in@@ k and blue s@@ qu@@ ares on the flo@@ or , which see@@ m to go up to the ce@@ il@@ ing .
I said , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this like a dre@@ am ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s not like a dre@@ am . It &apos;s like a mo@@ vi@@ e . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s got col@@ or . It &apos;s got mo@@ tion .
She said , &quot; &quot; All these people with E@@ a@@ ster@@ n d@@ ress , wal@@ king up and down , very re@@ peti@@ tive , very limi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she has a sense of hu@@ mor .
She knew it was a hallucin@@ ation .
But she was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . She &apos;d li@@ ved 9@@ 5 years and she &apos;d never had a hallucin@@ ation before .
She said that the hallucin@@ ations were un@@ rela@@ ted to anything she was thinking or fe@@ el@@ ing or doing , that they see@@ med to come on by themselves , or disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
She had no control over them .
She said she didn &apos;t recogni@@ ze any of the people or places in the hallucin@@ ations .
And n@@ one of the people or the animals , well , they all see@@ med ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of her .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wonder@@ ed if she was going ma@@ d or lo@@ sing her mind .
Well , I ex@@ a@@ min@@ ed her car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly .
She was a b@@ right old la@@ dy , perfec@@ tly san@@ e . She had no medical problems .
She was@@ n &apos;t on any medica@@ tions which could produ@@ ce hallucin@@ ations .
But she was b@@ lin@@ d .
And I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; There is a spe@@ cial form of visual hallucin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vi@@ sion or b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
This was ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally descri@@ bed , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; right back in the 1@@ 8@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y , by a man called Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net .
And you have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
She said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is this Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; D@@ id he have them hi@@ m@@ self ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell all the n@@ ur@@ ses that I have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m not cra@@ z@@ y . I &apos;m not de@@ men@@ ted . I have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me . &quot;
Well , so I did tell the n@@ ur@@ ses .
Now this , for me , is a common situ@@ ation .
I see a lot of el@@ der@@ ly people who are hear@@ ing im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
And about 10 percent of the visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get visual hallucin@@ ations .
You don &apos;t have to be comple@@ tely b@@ lin@@ d , only suf@@ fici@@ ently im@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
Now with the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion in the 1@@ 8@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y , Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net did not have them .
H@@ is gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther had these hallucin@@ ations .
H@@ is gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther was a ma@@ gi@@ stra@@ te , an el@@ der@@ ly man .
He &apos;d had ca@@ tar@@ ac@@ t sur@@ ger@@ y .
H@@ is vi@@ sion was pretty po@@ or .
And in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 , he descri@@ bed to his gran@@ d@@ son vari@@ ous things he was see@@ ing .
The first thing he said was he saw a han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ e@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
It was a lar@@ ge blue han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ e@@ f with four or@@ an@@ ge cir@@ c@@ les .
And he knew it was a hallucin@@ ation .
You don &apos;t have han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ ef@@ s in mi@@ da@@ ir .
And then he saw a big whe@@ el in mi@@ da@@ ir .
But sometimes he was@@ n &apos;t sure whether he was hallucin@@ ating or not , because the hallucin@@ ations would f@@ it in the con@@ text of the visi@@ ons .
So on one oc@@ ca@@ sion , when his gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters were visi@@ ting them , he said , &quot; &quot; And who are these han@@ d@@ some young men with you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; A@@ las , G@@ ran@@ d@@ pa@@ pa , there are no han@@ d@@ some young men . &quot; &quot; And then the han@@ d@@ some young men disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
It &apos;s ty@@ pi@@ cal of these hallucin@@ ations that they may come in a f@@ la@@ sh and disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar in a f@@ la@@ sh .
They don &apos;t us@@ u@@ ally fa@@ de in and out .
They are ra@@ ther su@@ d@@ den , and they change su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
Ch@@ ar@@ les L@@ ul@@ li@@ n , the gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther , saw hundre@@ ds of different figur@@ es , different lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es of all sor@@ ts .
O@@ n one oc@@ ca@@ sion , he saw a man in a ba@@ th@@ ro@@ be s@@ mo@@ king a pi@@ pe , and realiz@@ ed it was hi@@ m@@ self .
That was the only figur@@ e he recogni@@ zed .
O@@ n one oc@@ ca@@ sion when he was wal@@ king in the st@@ ree@@ ts of Par@@ is , he saw — this was real — a s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding .
But when he got back home , he saw a min@@ i@@ ature of the s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding six in@@ ches high , on his study table .
This re@@ peti@@ tion of per@@ cep@@ tion is sometimes called pal@@ in@@ op@@ si@@ a .
W@@ ith him and with R@@ os@@ ali@@ e , what see@@ ms to be going on — and R@@ os@@ ali@@ e said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; — and I said that as you lo@@ se vi@@ sion , as the visual par@@ ts of the brain are no lon@@ ger getting any in@@ put , they become hy@@ per@@ ac@@ tive and exci@@ table , and they start to fire s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very comp@@ lica@@ ted in@@ de@@ ed .
W@@ ith another pati@@ ent of min@@ e , who , also had some vi@@ sion , the vi@@ sion she had could be dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing .
O@@ n one oc@@ ca@@ sion , she said she saw a man in a stri@@ ped sh@@ ir@@ t in a res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant .
And he tur@@ ned around . And then he divi@@ ded into six figur@@ es in stri@@ ped sh@@ ir@@ ts , who started wal@@ king to@@ war@@ ds her .
She had very mo@@ bi@@ le hallucin@@ ations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
So@@ me@@ times she would see a te@@ en@@ age bo@@ y si@@ tting on the ho@@ od of the car .
And then when they came to a stop , the bo@@ y would do a su@@ d@@ den ver@@ tical ta@@ ke@@ off , 100 fo@@ o@@ t in the air , and then disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
A@@ no@@ ther pati@@ ent of min@@ e had a different sort of hallucin@@ ation .
This was a woman who didn &apos;t have t@@ rou@@ ble with her eyes , but the visual par@@ ts of her brain , a little tu@@ mor in the oc@@ ci@@ pi@@ tal cor@@ tex .
And , ab@@ o@@ ve all , she would see carto@@ ons .
These carto@@ ons would be trans@@ par@@ ent and would co@@ ver half the visual fiel@@ d , like a s@@ cre@@ en .
And especi@@ ally she saw carto@@ ons of K@@ er@@ mi@@ t the F@@ ro@@ g .
( Laughter ) Now , I don &apos;t wat@@ ch S@@ es@@ ame S@@ tre@@ et , but she made a point of saying , &quot; &quot; Why K@@ er@@ mi@@ t ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; K@@ er@@ mi@@ t the F@@ ro@@ g means nothing to me .
You know , I was wonder@@ ing about F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an determin@@ an@@ ts .
Why K@@ er@@ mi@@ t ?
And these fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
As a physi@@ ci@@ an , I have to try and defin@@ e what &apos;s going on , and to reas@@ sure people , especi@@ ally to reas@@ sure them that they &apos;re not going in@@ san@@ e .
So@@ me@@ thing like 10 percent , as I said , of visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get these .
But no more than one percent of the people ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge them , because they are af@@ ra@@ id they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
And if they do men@@ tion them to their own doc@@ tors they may be mis@@ diagno@@ sed .
In particular , the no@@ tion is that if you see things or he@@ ar things , you &apos;re going ma@@ d , but the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic hallucin@@ ations are quite different .
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic hallucin@@ ations , whether they are visual or vo@@ cal , they ad@@ d@@ ress you . They ac@@ c@@ use you .
They se@@ du@@ ce you . They hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ate you .
They j@@ e@@ er at you .
You interac@@ t with them .
There is n@@ one of this qu@@ ality of being ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed with these Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net hallucin@@ ations .
There is a fil@@ m . You &apos;re see@@ ing a fil@@ m which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
There is also a r@@ are thing called tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be e@@ pi@@ le@@ p@@ s@@ y , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel on@@ es@@ el@@ f trans@@ por@@ ted back to a time and place in the pa@@ st .
You s@@ me@@ ll ch@@ est@@ nu@@ ts ro@@ a@@ st@@ ing .
You he@@ ar the tra@@ f@@ fic . All the sen@@ ses are invol@@ ved .
And you &apos;re wa@@ it@@ ing for your gir@@ l .
And it &apos;s that T@@ u@@ es@@ day e@@ ven@@ ing back in 19@@ 8@@ 2 .
And the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be hallucin@@ ations are al@@ l@@ -@@ sense hallucin@@ ations , full of fe@@ el@@ ing , full of famili@@ ar@@ ity , lo@@ ca@@ ted in space and time , co@@ her@@ ent , dra@@ ma@@ tic .
The Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net ones are quite different .
So in the Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net hallucin@@ ations , you have all sor@@ ts of lev@@ els , from the ge@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ cal hallucin@@ ations — the p@@ in@@ k and blue s@@ qu@@ ares the woman had — up to quite e@@ labor@@ ate hallucin@@ ations with figur@@ es and especi@@ ally fac@@ es .
F@@ aces , and sometimes de@@ for@@ med fac@@ es , are the single com@@ mon@@ est thing in these hallucin@@ ations .
And one of the second com@@ mon@@ est is carto@@ ons .
So , what is going on ?
F@@ as@@ cin@@ at@@ ing@@ ly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do func@@ tional brain imag@@ er@@ y , to do f@@ M@@ R@@ I on people as they are hallucin@@ ating .
And in fact , to find that different par@@ ts of the visual brain are activ@@ ated as they are hallucin@@ ating .
When people have these simple ge@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ cal hallucin@@ ations , the pri@@ mar@@ y visual cor@@ tex is activ@@ ated .
This is the part of the brain which per@@ ce@@ i@@ ves e@@ d@@ ges and pa@@ tter@@ ns .
You don &apos;t form imag@@ es with your pri@@ mar@@ y visual cor@@ tex .
When imag@@ es are for@@ med , a high@@ er part of the visual cor@@ tex is invol@@ ved in the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be .
And in particular , one are@@ a of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be is called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
And it &apos;s kno@@ wn that if people have da@@ ma@@ ge in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , they maybe lo@@ se the ability to recogni@@ ze fac@@ es .
But if there is an ab@@ normal activi@@ ty in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , they may hallucin@@ ate fac@@ es , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
There is an are@@ a in the an@@ teri@@ or part of this g@@ y@@ r@@ us where te@@ e@@ th and eyes are repres@@ en@@ ted , and that part of the g@@ y@@ r@@ us is activ@@ ated when people get the de@@ for@@ med hallucin@@ ations .
There is another part of the brain which is especi@@ ally activ@@ ated when one se@@ es carto@@ ons .
It &apos;s activ@@ ated when one recogni@@ z@@ es carto@@ ons , when one dra@@ ws carto@@ ons , and when one hallucin@@ ates them .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be speci@@ fic .
A@@ ro@@ und 19@@ 70 , it was found that there were not only par@@ ts of the brain , but particular cells .
&quot; &quot; F@@ ace cells &quot; &quot; were disco@@ vered around 19@@ 70 .
And now we know that there are hundre@@ ds of other sor@@ ts of cells , which can be very , very speci@@ fic .
So you may not only have &quot; &quot; car &quot; &quot; cells , you may have &quot; &quot; A@@ st@@ on Mar@@ ti@@ n &quot; &quot; cells .
( Laughter ) I saw an A@@ st@@ on Mar@@ ti@@ n this mor@@ ning .
I had to br@@ ing it in .
And now it &apos;s in there some@@ where .
( Laughter ) Now , at this level , in what &apos;s called the in@@ fer@@ o@@ tem@@ po@@ ral cor@@ tex , there are only visual imag@@ es , or fi@@ g@@ ments or fra@@ g@@ ments .
It &apos;s only at high@@ er lev@@ els that the other sen@@ ses jo@@ in in and there are connec@@ tions with memor@@ y and emo@@ tion .
And in the Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , you don &apos;t go to those high@@ er lev@@ els .
You &apos;re in these lev@@ els of in@@ fer@@ i@@ or visual cor@@ tex where you have thousands and ten@@ s of thousands and mi@@ llions of imag@@ es , or fi@@ g@@ ments , or fra@@ g@@ men@@ tar@@ y fi@@ g@@ ments , all ne@@ ur@@ ally en@@ co@@ ded in particular cells or small c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of cells .
Nor@@ m@@ ally these are all part of the inte@@ gra@@ ted stre@@ am of per@@ cep@@ tion , or imag@@ in@@ ation , and one is not consci@@ ous of them .
It is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or b@@ lin@@ d that the process is inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted .
And instead of getting normal per@@ cep@@ tion , you &apos;re getting an an@@ ar@@ ch@@ ic , con@@ vul@@ sive sti@@ mu@@ lation , or re@@ le@@ ase , of all of these visual cells in the in@@ fer@@ o@@ tem@@ po@@ ral cor@@ tex .
So , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly you see a face . S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly you see a car .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly this , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly that .
The mind does its best to organi@@ ze and to give some sort of co@@ her@@ ence to this , but not terri@@ bly suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly .
But in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recogni@@ ze the people . I can &apos;t form any as@@ soci@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ er@@ mi@@ t means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get any@@ where thinking of them as dre@@ a@@ ms .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
I think I just want to re@@ cap@@ it@@ u@@ late and say this is common .
Th@@ in@@ k of the number of b@@ lin@@ d people .
There must be hundre@@ ds of thousands of b@@ lin@@ d people who have these hallucin@@ ations , but are too s@@ car@@ ed to men@@ tion them .
So this sort of thing nee@@ ds to be b@@ rou@@ ght into no@@ tice , for patients , for doc@@ tors , for the publi@@ c .
Fin@@ ally , I think they are in@@ fin@@ i@@ tely interesting and valu@@ able , for gi@@ ving one some in@@ si@@ ght as to how the brain works .
Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net said , 2@@ 50 years ago — he wonder@@ ed how , thinking these hallucin@@ ations , how , as he put it , the the@@ ater of the mind could be gener@@ ated by the mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of the brain .
Now , 2@@ 50 years later , I think we &apos;re beg@@ in@@ ning to gli@@ mp@@ se how this is done .
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : That was super@@ b . Thank you so much .
You spe@@ ak about these things with so much in@@ si@@ ght and em@@ path@@ y for your patients .
Ha@@ ve you yourself experi@@ en@@ ced any of the sy@@ n@@ dro@@ mes you wri@@ te about ?
O@@ li@@ ver S@@ ac@@ ks : I was af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;d ask that .
( Laughter ) Well , ye@@ ah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red myself .
I &apos;m b@@ lin@@ d in one ey@@ e , and not terri@@ bly good in the other .
And I see the ge@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ cal hallucin@@ ations .
But they stop there .
C@@ A : And they don &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b you ?
O@@ S : Well they don &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b me any more than my tin@@ n@@ it@@ us , which I ig@@ nor@@ e .
They oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally inter@@ est me , and I have many pic@@ tures of them in my no@@ te@@ bo@@ o@@ ks .
I &apos;ve g@@ one and had an f@@ M@@ R@@ I myself , to see how my visual cor@@ tex is taking over .
And when I see all these h@@ ex@@ ag@@ ons and comple@@ x things , which I also have , in visual mi@@ gra@@ ine , I won@@ der whether everyone se@@ es things like this , and whether things like ca@@ ve art or or@@ na@@ mental art may have been der@@ i@@ ved from them a bit .
Thank you so much for shar@@ ing .
O@@ S : Thank you . Thank you .

S@@ ho@@ w@@ ed up the first day ready to make co@@ f@@ fe@@ e and phot@@ o@@ co@@ pi@@ es , but was pa@@ i@@ red with this ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , de@@ e@@ p@@ ly in@@ spi@@ red at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y na@@ med J@@ ef@@ f P@@ ur@@ cell , who th@@ r@@ ust me on@@ to the front lin@@ es from the very first day .
And over the course of n@@ ine months I had the chan@@ ce to have do@@ z@@ ens of conversa@@ tions with low@@ -@@ in@@ come famili@@ es in Bo@@ st@@ on who would come in pres@@ ent@@ ing with h@@ ou@@ sing is@@ su@@ es , but always had an under@@ l@@ ying health is@@ su@@ e .
So I had a cli@@ ent who came in , about to be evi@@ c@@ ted because he ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t pa@@ id his r@@ ent .
But he ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t pa@@ id his r@@ ent , of course , because he &apos;s pa@@ ying for his H@@ I@@ V medi@@ cation and just can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d both .
We had mo@@ ms who would come in , da@@ u@@ ghter has as@@ th@@ ma , wa@@ kes up co@@ vered in co@@ c@@ k@@ ro@@ ach@@ es every mor@@ ning .
And I would col@@ lec@@ t the co@@ c@@ k@@ ro@@ ach@@ es , ho@@ t g@@ lu@@ e@@ -@@ g@@ un them to this pos@@ ter bo@@ ard that we &apos;d br@@ ing to cour@@ t for our ca@@ ses .
And we always w@@ on because the j@@ ud@@ ges were just so gro@@ s@@ sed out .
F@@ ar more effec@@ tive , I have to say , than anything I later learned in la@@ w school .
And at the end of my f@@ res@@ h@@ man year of colle@@ ge , I read an ar@@ tic@@ le about the work that D@@ r. B@@ ar@@ ry Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ man was doing as C@@ ha@@ ir of P@@ edi@@ at@@ ri@@ cs at Bo@@ st@@ on M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter .
And his first hi@@ re was a le@@ g@@ al ser@@ vi@@ ces at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y to repres@@ ent the patients .
So I called B@@ ar@@ ry , and with his b@@ l@@ es@@ sing , in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 19@@ 9@@ 5 wal@@ ked into the wa@@ it@@ ing room of the pedi@@ at@@ ri@@ cs c@@ lin@@ ic at Bo@@ st@@ on M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter .
I &apos;ll never for@@ get , the T@@ V@@ s play@@ ed this en@@ d@@ less re@@ el of carto@@ ons .
And the ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion of mo@@ thers who had ta@@ ken two , three , sometimes four bus@@ es to br@@ ing their child to the doc@@ tor was just pal@@ p@@ able .
They said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day we have patients that come into the c@@ lin@@ ic — child has an e@@ ar infec@@ tion , I pres@@ cri@@ be antibio@@ tics .
But the real is@@ su@@ e is there &apos;s no food at home .
The real is@@ su@@ e is that child is living with 12 other people in a tw@@ o@@ -@@ be@@ dro@@ o@@ m apar@@ t@@ ment .
And I don &apos;t even ask about those is@@ su@@ es because there &apos;s nothing I can do .
I have 1@@ 3 minu@@ tes with each pati@@ ent .
P@@ a@@ ti@@ ents are p@@ il@@ ing up in the c@@ lin@@ ic wa@@ it@@ ing room .
I have no idea where the ne@@ ar@@ est food pan@@ try is .
And I don &apos;t even have any help . &quot; &quot; In that c@@ lin@@ ic , even today , there are two social wor@@ kers for 2@@ 4@@ ,000 pedi@@ at@@ ri@@ c patients , which is better than a lot of the c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s out there .
So H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads was bor@@ n of these conversa@@ tions — a simple mode@@ l where doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses can pres@@ cri@@ be nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous food , he@@ at in the win@@ ter and other ba@@ sic res@@ our@@ ces for their patients the same way they pres@@ cri@@ be medi@@ cation .
P@@ a@@ ti@@ ents then take their pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to our des@@ k in the c@@ lin@@ ic wa@@ it@@ ing room where we have a co@@ re of w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed colle@@ ge stud@@ ent ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ tes who work side by side with these famili@@ es to connec@@ t them out to the exist@@ ing lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe of commun@@ ity res@@ our@@ ces .
So we beg@@ an with a car@@ d table in the c@@ lin@@ ic wa@@ it@@ ing room — tot@@ ally le@@ mon@@ ade st@@ and st@@ y@@ le .
But today we have a thou@@ s@@ and colle@@ ge stud@@ ent ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ tes who are working to connec@@ t ne@@ ar@@ ly 9@@ ,000 patients and their famili@@ es with the res@@ our@@ ces that they need to be health@@ y .
So 1@@ 8 months ago I got this e@@ mai@@ l that chan@@ ged my life .
In 19@@ 6@@ 5 D@@ r. Ge@@ ig@@ er fo@@ un@@ ded one of the first two commun@@ ity health cen@@ ters in this country , in a br@@ u@@ t@@ ally po@@ or are@@ a in the M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i D@@ el@@ ta .
And so many of his patients came in pres@@ ent@@ ing with mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion that be beg@@ an pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ing food for them .
And they would take these pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to the lo@@ cal super@@ mar@@ ket , which would fi@@ ll them and then char@@ ge the ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ y bu@@ d@@ get of the c@@ lin@@ ic .
And they s@@ ent this bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ at down to tell Ge@@ ig@@ er that he was expec@@ ted to use their dollars for medical care — to which Ge@@ ig@@ er fa@@ m@@ ously and lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally respon@@ ded , &quot; &quot; The last time I ch@@ ec@@ ked my tex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , the speci@@ fic ther@@ ap@@ y for mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion was food . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So when I got this e@@ mai@@ l from D@@ r. Ge@@ ig@@ er , I knew I was sup@@ pos@@ ed to be pro@@ u@@ d to be part of this hist@@ ory .
But the tru@@ th is I was de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ted .
Here we are , 4@@ 5 years after Ge@@ ig@@ er has pres@@ cri@@ bed food for his patients , and I have doc@@ tors telling me , &quot; O@@ n those is@@ su@@ es , we prac@@ tice a &apos; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &apos; poli@@ cy . &quot;
F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ five years after Ge@@ ig@@ er , H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads has to re@@ inv@@ ent the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for ba@@ sic res@@ our@@ ces .
So I have sp@@ ent h@@ our@@ s u@@ po@@ n h@@ our@@ s trying to make sense of this we@@ ird G@@ ro@@ und@@ ho@@ g D@@ ay .
How is it that if for deca@@ des we had a pretty stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward to@@ ol for ke@@ e@@ ping patients , and especi@@ ally low@@ -@@ in@@ come patients , health@@ y , that we didn &apos;t use it ?
If we know what it takes to have a health@@ care system ra@@ ther than a si@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?
These ques@@ tions , in my mind , are not hard because the ans@@ w@@ ers are comp@@ lica@@ ted , they are hard because they re@@ qui@@ re that we be hon@@ est with ourselves .
My belie@@ f is that it &apos;s almost too pa@@ in@@ ful to ar@@ tic@@ u@@ late our as@@ pira@@ tions for our health@@ care system , or even ad@@ mi@@ t that we have any at all .
Because if we did , they would be so re@@ mo@@ ved from our cur@@ r@@ ent re@@ ality .
But that doesn &apos;t change my belie@@ f that all of us , de@@ ep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of des@@ ir@@ es .
That if we are hon@@ est with ourselves and li@@ ste@@ n qui@@ e@@ tly , that we all har@@ b@@ or one fi@@ er@@ ce@@ ly hel@@ d as@@ pira@@ tion for our health@@ care : that it keep us health@@ y .
This as@@ pira@@ tion that our health@@ care keep us health@@ y is an enor@@ m@@ ously power@@ ful one .
And the way I think about this is that health@@ care is like any other system .
It &apos;s just a set of cho@@ ic@@ es that people make .
What if we decided to make a different set of cho@@ ic@@ es ?
These things are our@@ s .
They will be used for our pur@@ pos@@ es .
They will be used to realiz@@ e our as@@ pira@@ tion &quot; &quot; ?
So that &apos;s where H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads beg@@ an .
We started with the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion pa@@ d — a very ordin@@ ary piece of pa@@ per — and we asked , not what do patients need to get health@@ y — antibio@@ tics , an in@@ hal@@ er , medi@@ cation — but what do patients need to be health@@ y , to not get si@@ ck in the first place ?
And we ch@@ ose to use the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for that pur@@ pos@@ e .
They &apos;re asked , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning out of food at the end of the mon@@ th ?
D@@ o you have sa@@ fe h@@ ou@@ sing ? &quot; &quot; And when the doc@@ tor beg@@ ins the visi@@ t , she kno@@ ws he@@ ight , we@@ ight , is there food at home , is the family living in a sh@@ el@@ ter .
And that not only le@@ ads to a better set of c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal cho@@ ic@@ es , but the doc@@ tor can also pres@@ cri@@ be those res@@ our@@ ces for the pati@@ ent , using H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads like any other sub@@ -@@ speci@@ al@@ ty re@@ fer@@ ral .
And we ga@@ ve it a sho@@ t .
You need more .
And on the other hand , it &apos;s a radi@@ cal trans@@ forma@@ tion of the elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c medical recor@@ d from a sta@@ tic re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of diagno@@ stic information to a health pro@@ mo@@ tion to@@ ol .
In the priva@@ te sec@@ tor , when you s@@ que@@ e@@ ze that kind of ad@@ di@@ tional valu@@ e out of a fi@@ xe@@ d-@@ co@@ st inv@@ est@@ ment , it &apos;s called a bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar comp@@ any .
But in my world , it &apos;s called re@@ duc@@ ed ob@@ es@@ ity and diabe@@ tes .
It &apos;s called health@@ care — a system where doc@@ tors can pres@@ cri@@ be solu@@ tions to impro@@ ve health , not just man@@ age disease .
So every day in this country three million patients pas@@ s through about 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 c@@ lin@@ ic wa@@ it@@ ing roo@@ ms in this country .
And what do they do when they &apos;re there ?
They si@@ t , they wat@@ ch the g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish in the fish tan@@ k , they read extre@@ me@@ ly old co@@ pi@@ es of G@@ o@@ od H@@ ou@@ se@@ ke@@ e@@ ping ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
But most@@ ly we all just si@@ t there fo@@ re@@ ver , wa@@ it@@ ing .
How did we get here where we de@@ v@@ ote hundre@@ ds of ac@@ r@@ es and thousands of h@@ our@@ s to wa@@ it@@ ing ?
But what if instead of wa@@ it@@ ing for h@@ our@@ s an@@ xi@@ ously , the wa@@ it@@ ing room became the place where H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads tur@@ ned your he@@ at back on ?
And of course all of this re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a bro@@ ad@@ er wor@@ k@@ for@@ ce .
But if we &apos;re crea@@ tive , we already have that too .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th just takes more time .
It re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a n@@ on-@@ c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal ar@@ my of commun@@ ity health wor@@ kers and case man@@ ag@@ ers and many others .
U@@ nen@@ cu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed by c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ties , un@@ wi@@ lling to take no for an answer from those bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ ci@@ es that ten@@ d to cr@@ us@@ h patients , and with an un@@ par@@ al@@ le@@ led ability for information re@@ tri@@ ev@@ al hon@@ ed through years of using Goog@@ le .
Now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in ei@@ ther case it &apos;s real .
And H@@ e@@ al@@ th Le@@ ads is based on the pres@@ u@@ mp@@ tion that for too long we have asked too little of our colle@@ ge stud@@ ents when it comes to real impac@@ t in vulner@@ able communi@@ ties .
Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k al@@ one has half a million colle@@ ge stud@@ ents .
And they lea@@ ve with the con@@ vi@@ c@@ tion , the ability and the ef@@ fica@@ cy to realiz@@ e our most ba@@ sic as@@ pira@@ tions for health care .
And the thing is , there &apos;s thousands of these fol@@ ks already out there .
M@@ ia says , &quot; &quot; When my cla@@ s@@ s@@ ma@@ tes wri@@ te a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion , they think their work is done .
When I wri@@ te a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion , I think , can the family read the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion ?
D@@ o they have trans@@ por@@ tation to the ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ y ?
D@@ o they have food to take with the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion ?
D@@ o they have in@@ sur@@ ance to fi@@ ll the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion ?
But the tru@@ th is I &apos;ve sp@@ ent every wa@@ king minu@@ te ne@@ ar@@ ly sin@@ ce then cha@@ sing that vi@@ sion .
I believe that at the end of the day when we meas@@ ure our health@@ care , it will not be by the dise@@ ases cu@@ red , but by the dise@@ ases pre@@ ven@@ ted .
It will not be by the ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence of our technolo@@ gi@@ es or the so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ cation of our speci@@ ali@@ sts , but by how r@@ are@@ ly we nee@@ ded them .
Thank you .

G@@ ro@@ wing up in Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an as the da@@ u@@ ghter of a cal@@ li@@ gra@@ ph@@ er , one of my most tre@@ as@@ u@@ red memor@@ ies was my mother sho@@ wing me the be@@ au@@ ty , the s@@ hap@@ e and the form of Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ters .
E@@ ver sin@@ ce then , I was fas@@ cin@@ ated by this incre@@ di@@ ble language .
But to an out@@ si@@ der , it see@@ ms to be as imp@@ en@@ e@@ tra@@ ble as the Gre@@ at W@@ all of Ch@@ ina .
O@@ ver the pa@@ st few years , I &apos;ve been wonder@@ ing if I can bre@@ ak down this w@@ all , so any@@ one who wan@@ ts to understand and ap@@ preci@@ ate the be@@ au@@ ty of this so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted language could do so .
I started thinking about how a new , f@@ ast me@@ th@@ od of learning Ch@@ in@@ ese might be u@@ se@@ ful .
S@@ in@@ ce the age of five , I started to learn how to dra@@ w every single st@@ ro@@ ke for each char@@ ac@@ ter in the correc@@ t se@@ qu@@ ence .
I learned new char@@ ac@@ ters every day dur@@ ing the course of the next 15 years .
S@@ in@@ ce we only have five minu@@ tes , it &apos;s better that we have a f@@ ast and simp@@ ler way .
A Ch@@ in@@ ese s@@ cho@@ lar would understand 20@@ ,000 char@@ ac@@ ters .
You only need 1@@ ,000 to understand the ba@@ sic liter@@ ac@@ y .
The top 200 will al@@ low you to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end 40 percent of ba@@ sic liter@@ ature — enough to read ro@@ ad si@@ g@@ ns , res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant men@@ us , to understand the ba@@ sic idea of the we@@ b pa@@ ges or the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s .
To@@ day I &apos;m going to start with ei@@ ght to show you how the me@@ th@@ od works .
You are ready ?
O@@ p@@ en your m@@ outh as wi@@ de as possible until it &apos;s s@@ qu@@ are .
You get a m@@ outh .
This is a person going for a wal@@ k .
Per@@ son .
If the s@@ hap@@ e of the fire is a person with two ar@@ ms on both si@@ des , as if she was y@@ el@@ ling f@@ ran@@ tically , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — This sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l actually is ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally from the s@@ hap@@ e of the f@@ la@@ me , but I like to think that way . W@@ hi@@ che@@ ver works for you .
This is a t@@ ree .
T@@ ree .
This is a moun@@ tain .
The s@@ un .
The mo@@ on .
The sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the do@@ or loo@@ ks like a pa@@ ir of sal@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the w@@ il@@ d w@@ est .
I call these ei@@ ght char@@ ac@@ ters radi@@ cal@@ s .
They are the buil@@ ding blo@@ c@@ ks for you to create l@@ ots more char@@ ac@@ ters .
A person .
If someone wal@@ ks be@@ hind , that is &quot; &quot; to fol@@ low . &quot; &quot; As the old saying goes , two is comp@@ any , three is a cro@@ w@@ d .
If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms wi@@ de , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the m@@ outh , the person is tra@@ p@@ ped .
He &apos;s a pri@@ son@@ er , just like J@@ on@@ ah inside the wh@@ al@@ e .
One t@@ ree is a t@@ ree . T@@ w@@ o tre@@ es together , we have the w@@ oo@@ ds .
Th@@ ree tre@@ es together , we create the for@@ est .
P@@ ut a pl@@ ank under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree , we have the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion .
P@@ ut a m@@ outh on the top of the t@@ ree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ o@@ t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ as@@ y to remember , sin@@ ce a talking t@@ ree is pretty i@@ di@@ o@@ tic .
Re@@ member fire ?
T@@ w@@ o fir@@ es together , I get really ho@@ t .
Th@@ ree fir@@ es together , that &apos;s a lot of f@@ la@@ mes .
S@@ et the fire under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ ning .
For us , the s@@ un is the s@@ our@@ ce of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
T@@ w@@ o s@@ uns together , pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous .
Th@@ ree together , that &apos;s s@@ par@@ k@@ les .
P@@ ut the s@@ un and the mo@@ on sh@@ in@@ ing together , it &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
It also means to@@ mor@@ row , after a day and a ni@@ ght .
The s@@ un is coming up ab@@ o@@ ve the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on . S@@ un@@ ri@@ se .
A do@@ or . P@@ ut a pl@@ ank inside the do@@ or , it &apos;s a do@@ or bol@@ t .
P@@ ut a m@@ outh inside the do@@ or , as@@ king ques@@ tions .
K@@ no@@ ck kno@@ ck . I@@ s any@@ one home ?
This person is s@@ ne@@ a@@ king out of a do@@ or , es@@ ca@@ ping , ev@@ ad@@ ing .
O@@ n the left , we have a woman .
T@@ w@@ o wo@@ men together , they have an ar@@ gu@@ ment .
( Laughter ) Th@@ ree wo@@ men together , be car@@ e@@ ful , it &apos;s adul@@ ter@@ y .
So we have g@@ one through almost 30 char@@ ac@@ ters .
B@@ y using this me@@ th@@ od , the first ei@@ ght radi@@ cal@@ s will al@@ low you to build 3@@ 2 .
The next gro@@ up of ei@@ ght char@@ ac@@ ters will build an ex@@ tra 3@@ 2 .
So with very little ef@@ for@@ t , you will be able to learn a cou@@ ple hundre@@ d char@@ ac@@ ters , which is the same as a Ch@@ in@@ ese ei@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ year@@ -old .
So after we know the char@@ ac@@ ters , we start buil@@ ding ph@@ ra@@ ses .
For example , the moun@@ tain and the fire together , we have fire moun@@ tain . It &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o .
We know J@@ ap@@ an is the land of the ri@@ sing s@@ un .
This is a s@@ un pl@@ ac@@ ed with the ori@@ g@@ in , because J@@ ap@@ an li@@ es to the e@@ ast of Ch@@ ina .
So a s@@ un , ori@@ g@@ in together , we build J@@ ap@@ an .
A person be@@ hind J@@ ap@@ an , what do we get ?
A J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese person .
The char@@ ac@@ ter on the left is two moun@@ ta@@ ins sta@@ c@@ ked on top of each other .
In an@@ ci@@ ent Ch@@ ina , that means in ex@@ i@@ le , because Ch@@ in@@ ese em@@ per@@ ors , they put their poli@@ tical en@@ e@@ mi@@ es in ex@@ i@@ le be@@ y@@ on@@ d moun@@ ta@@ ins .
No@@ wa@@ days , ex@@ i@@ le has tur@@ ned into getting out .
A m@@ outh which te@@ lls you where to get out is an ex@@ it .
This is a sli@@ de to re@@ mind me that I should stop talking and get off of the sta@@ ge . Thank you .

I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
J@@ ust think about this problem for a second .
Here is a lu@@ m@@ p of fl@@ es@@ h , about three po@@ unds , which you can h@@ old in the pal@@ m of your hand .
But it can con@@ temp@@ late the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar space .
It can con@@ temp@@ late the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask ques@@ tions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own exist@@ ence , about the n@@ ature of God .
And this is tru@@ ly the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est my@@ ster@@ y con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adul@@ t human brain .
And each ne@@ ur@@ on makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 10@@ ,000 con@@ tac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain .
And based on this , people have cal@@ cu@@ la@@ ted that the number of per@@ mu@@ ta@@ tions and com@@ bin@@ ations of brain activi@@ ty ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the number of ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y partic@@ les in the universe .
So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?
One appro@@ ach is to look at patients who had l@@ esi@@ ons in different part of the brain , and study chan@@ ges in their behavi@@ or .
This is what I s@@ po@@ ke about in the last TED .
To@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different appro@@ ach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different par@@ ts of the brain , and actually recor@@ d the activi@@ ty of individu@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
S@@ or@@ t of e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on the activi@@ ty of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
Now , one rec@@ ent disco@@ very that has been made by resear@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in Par@@ ma , by Gi@@ a@@ como R@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ o@@ la@@ tt@@ i and his col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , is a gro@@ up of neurons called mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es .
Now , it tur@@ ns out there are neurons which are called ordin@@ ary mot@@ or com@@ m@@ and neurons in the front of the brain , which have been kno@@ wn for over 50 years .
These neurons will fire when a person per@@ for@@ ms a speci@@ fic ac@@ tion .
For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an ap@@ ple , a mot@@ or com@@ m@@ and ne@@ ur@@ on in the front of my brain will fire .
If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another ne@@ ur@@ on will fire , com@@ man@@ ding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject .
These are called mot@@ or com@@ m@@ and neurons that have been kno@@ wn for a long time .
But what R@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ o@@ la@@ tt@@ i found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ for@@ ming the same ac@@ tion .
So , here is a ne@@ ur@@ on that fir@@ es when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fir@@ es when I wat@@ ch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something .
And this is tru@@ ly a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ hing .
Because it &apos;s as though this ne@@ ur@@ on is ado@@ p@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of vie@@ w .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ for@@ ming a virtual re@@ ality si@@ mu@@ lation of the other person &apos;s ac@@ tion .
Now , what is the signifi@@ can@@ ce of these mir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?
For one thing they must be invol@@ ved in things like imi@@ tation and e@@ mu@@ lation .
Because to imi@@ ta@@ te a comple@@ x ac@@ t re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es my brain to ado@@ pt the other person &apos;s point of vie@@ w .
So , this is important for imi@@ tation and e@@ mu@@ lation .
Well , why is that important ?
Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de .
So , how do you do imi@@ tation ? Why is imi@@ tation important ?
M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and imi@@ tation , e@@ mu@@ lation .
Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on of human culture .
If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 10@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolu@@ tion , it tur@@ ns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago .
And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gen@@ ce and ra@@ pi@@ d s@@ pre@@ ad of a number of s@@ ki@@ lls that are uni@@ que to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavi@@ or .
All of that happened rela@@ tively qu@@ ick@@ ly .
E@@ ven though the human brain had ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ved its present size almost three or four hundre@@ d thou@@ s@@ and years ago , 10@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago all of this happened very , very qu@@ ick@@ ly .
And I cla@@ i@@ m that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gen@@ ce of a so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted mir@@ ro@@ r ne@@ ur@@ on system , which al@@ low@@ ed you to e@@ mu@@ late and imi@@ ta@@ te other people &apos;s ac@@ tions .
So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal disco@@ very by one member of the gro@@ up , say the use of fire , or a particular ty@@ pe of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this s@@ pre@@ ad ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly , h@@ ori@@ zon@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was transmi@@ t@@ ted ver@@ tically , down the gener@@ ations .
So , this made evolu@@ tion su@@ d@@ den@@ ly L@@ a@@ mar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an .
D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an evolu@@ tion is s@@ low ; it takes hundre@@ ds of thousands of years .
A po@@ lar be@@ ar , to e@@ vol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 10@@ 0@@ ,000 years .
A human being , a child , can just wat@@ ch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the po@@ lar be@@ ar took 10@@ 0@@ ,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minu@@ tes , maybe 10 minu@@ tes .
And then on@@ ce it &apos;s learned this it s@@ pre@@ ads in ge@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The imi@@ tation of comple@@ x s@@ ki@@ lls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation .
Now there is another kind of mir@@ ro@@ r ne@@ ur@@ on , which is invol@@ ved in something quite different .
And that is , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for ac@@ tion , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch .
In other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , ne@@ ur@@ on in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sen@@ s@@ ory cor@@ tex in the sen@@ s@@ ory re@@ gi@@ on of the brain fir@@ es .
But the same ne@@ ur@@ on , in some ca@@ ses , will fire when I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched .
So , it &apos;s em@@ path@@ i@@ zing the other person being tou@@ ched .
So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different lo@@ ca@@ tions . D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ent neurons for different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same lo@@ cation .
So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in em@@ path@@ y .
Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : If I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ fu@@ sed and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ e@@ ly by wat@@ ching somebody being tou@@ ched ?
I mean , I em@@ path@@ i@@ ze with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch .
Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got recep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pa@@ in recep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched .
So , em@@ path@@ i@@ ze , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se you &apos;ll get con@@ fu@@ sed and m@@ ud@@ d@@ led . &quot; &quot; Okay , so there is a fe@@ e@@ d@@ back si@@ gn@@ al that ve@@ to@@ es the si@@ gn@@ al of the mir@@ ro@@ r ne@@ ur@@ on pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from consci@@ ously experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing that tou@@ ch .
But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ ch@@ ial ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is nu@@ m@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now wat@@ ch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand .
In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
So , I call them G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i neurons , or em@@ path@@ y neurons .
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t meta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal sense .
All that &apos;s separ@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in .
Re@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind .
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ a@@ ster@@ n phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y , and that is there is no real in@@ depen@@ d@@ ent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people .
You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just vi@@ a F@@ ace@@ book and Internet , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons .
And there is whole cha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
And there is no real dist@@ inc@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess of your consci@@ ousness from somebody else &apos;s consci@@ ousness .
And this is not mu@@ m@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ u@@ mb@@ o phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
It emer@@ ges from our underst@@ an@@ ding of ba@@ sic neuro@@ science .
So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , and you wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m .
Now the a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ hing thing is , if you have pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b , you s@@ que@@ e@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ sa@@ ge the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ e@@ ves the pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m hand , almost as though the ne@@ ur@@ on were ob@@ tain@@ ing reli@@ e@@ f from mer@@ e@@ ly wat@@ ching somebody else being mas@@ sa@@ ged .
So , here you have my last sli@@ de .
For the lon@@ g@@ est time people have re@@ gar@@ ded science and human@@ i@@ ties as being dist@@ inc@@ t .
C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now s@@ po@@ ke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , human@@ i@@ ties on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et .
So , I &apos;m saying the mir@@ ro@@ r ne@@ ur@@ on system under@@ li@@ es the inter@@ face al@@ lo@@ wing you to re@@ think about is@@ su@@ es like consci@@ ousness , repres@@ en@@ tation of self , what separ@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what al@@ lo@@ ws you to em@@ path@@ i@@ ze with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the emer@@ gen@@ ce of culture and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , which is uni@@ que to human be@@ ings . Thank you .

One day , L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles T@@ im@@ es co@@ lu@@ m@@ n@@ ist Ste@@ ve Lo@@ pe@@ z was wal@@ king al@@ ong the st@@ ree@@ ts of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles when he heard beautiful music .
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man , an A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can man , char@@ ming , ru@@ gg@@ ed , ho@@ me@@ less , pla@@ ying a vi@@ oli@@ n that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Ste@@ ve &apos;s co@@ lu@@ m@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a book , which was tur@@ ned into a mo@@ vi@@ e , with R@@ ob@@ er@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r. ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve Lo@@ pe@@ z , and J@@ ami@@ e Fo@@ x@@ x as Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ ony A@@ y@@ ers , the J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ in@@ ed dou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose pro@@ mi@@ sing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ or@@ t by a tra@@ gi@@ c af@@ fli@@ c@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el dro@@ p@@ ped out of J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suf@@ fer@@ ed a comple@@ te bre@@ a@@ k@@ down , and 30 years later he was living ho@@ me@@ less on the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ kid R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge all of you to read Ste@@ ve &apos;s book or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ vi@@ e to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that for@@ med between these two men , but how music hel@@ ped s@@ hap@@ e that bon@@ d , and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely was instru@@ mental — if you &apos;ll par@@ don the p@@ un — in hel@@ ping Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the st@@ ree@@ ts .
I me@@ t M@@ r. A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 , two years ago , at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all .
He had just heard a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ ies , and came bac@@ k@@ sta@@ ge and in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self .
He was spe@@ a@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton and how the D@@ o@@ d@@ g@@ ers were never going to make the W@@ or@@ ld S@@ er@@ ies , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ oli@@ n pas@@ sa@@ ge work in the last mo@@ ve@@ ment of Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th S@@ y@@ mp@@ hon@@ y .
And we got talking about music , and I got an e@@ mai@@ l from Ste@@ ve a few days later saying that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interes@@ ted in a vi@@ oli@@ n l@@ es@@ son with me .
Now , I should men@@ tion that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el ref@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and han@@ d@@ cu@@ f@@ f@@ s , and that s@@ car has sta@@ y@@ ed with him for his entire life .
But as a resul@@ t now , he is pro@@ ne to these sch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic e@@ pi@@ so@@ des , the wor@@ st of which can man@@ i@@ f@@ est themselves as him ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ding and then disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing for days , wan@@ der@@ ing the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ kid R@@ ow , ex@@ pos@@ ed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed u@@ po@@ n him .
And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in such a sta@@ te of ag@@ i@@ tation when we started our first l@@ es@@ son at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all — he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes , he was lost .
And he was talking about invi@@ sible de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his s@@ le@@ ep .
And I was af@@ ra@@ id , not for myself , but I was af@@ ra@@ id that I was going to lo@@ se him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his sta@@ tes , and that I would ru@@ in his rela@@ tion@@ ship with the vi@@ oli@@ n if I started talking about s@@ cal@@ es and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exci@@ ting for@@ ms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ oli@@ n pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
( Laughter ) So , I just started pla@@ ying .
And I play@@ ed the first mo@@ ve@@ ment of the Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven Vi@@ oli@@ n Con@@ certo .
And as I play@@ ed , I underst@@ o@@ od that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s eyes .
It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some invi@@ sible ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ u@@ tical , a che@@ mi@@ cal reac@@ tion , for which my pla@@ ying the music was its ca@@ tal@@ y@@ st .
And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ for@@ med into underst@@ an@@ ding , a qui@@ et curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty and gra@@ ce .
And in a mi@@ rac@@ le , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ oli@@ n and he started pla@@ ying , by e@@ ar , cer@@ tain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vi@@ oli@@ n con@@ cer@@ tos which he then asked me to comple@@ te — M@@ en@@ de@@ l@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , T@@ cha@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y , S@@ i@@ beli@@ us .
And we started talking about music , from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from B@@ ar@@ tó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ k@@ k@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en .
And I underst@@ o@@ od that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of music , but he rela@@ ted to this music at a person@@ al level .
He s@@ po@@ ke about it with the kind of pas@@ sion and underst@@ an@@ ding that I share with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es in the L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
And through pla@@ ying music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ for@@ med from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from wal@@ king the st@@ ree@@ ts of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , bri@@ lli@@ ant , J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ in@@ ed mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an .
Music is medic@@ ine . Music chan@@ ges us .
And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music is san@@ ity .
Because music al@@ lo@@ ws him to take his thou@@ ghts and de@@ lu@@ si@@ ons and s@@ hap@@ e them through his imag@@ in@@ ation and his crea@@ tivi@@ ty , into re@@ ality .
And that is an es@@ ca@@ pe from his tor@@ men@@ ted sta@@ te .
And I underst@@ o@@ od that this was the very es@@ sen@@ ce of art .
This was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exist@@ s within all of us at our very funda@@ mental co@@ re , our emo@@ tions , and through our arti@@ stic len@@ s , through our crea@@ tivi@@ ty , we &apos;re able to s@@ hap@@ e those emo@@ tions into re@@ ality .
And the re@@ ality of that expres@@ sion re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ es and un@@ it@@ es us .
And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music b@@ rou@@ ght him back into a f@@ old of fri@@ ends .
The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music b@@ rou@@ ght him back into a family of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans that underst@@ o@@ od him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and res@@ pec@@ ted him .
And I will always make music with Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , whether we &apos;re at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all or on S@@ kid R@@ ow , because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I became a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an .
Thank you .

Well , there &apos;s l@@ ots to talk about , but I think I &apos;m just going to play to start off .

So , I wanted to do something spe@@ cial today .
I want to de@@ but a new son@@ g that I &apos;ve been working on in the last five or six months .
And there &apos;s few things more th@@ ri@@ lling than pla@@ ying a son@@ g for the first time in front of an audi@@ ence , especi@@ ally when it &apos;s hal@@ f-@@ fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m kind of ho@@ ping some conversa@@ tions here might help me fin@@ is@@ h it .
Because it gets into all sor@@ ts of cra@@ z@@ y re@@ al@@ ms .
And so this is basi@@ cally a son@@ g about lo@@ op@@ s , but not the kind of lo@@ op@@ s that I make up here .
They &apos;re fe@@ e@@ d@@ back lo@@ op@@ s .
And in the audi@@ o world that &apos;s when the micro@@ ph@@ one gets too clo@@ se to its sound s@@ our@@ ce , and then it gets in this sel@@ f-@@ dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tive loo@@ p that cre@@ ates a very un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant sound .
And I &apos;m going to de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te for you .

♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a loo@@ p , fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p ♫ ♫ This is a — ( F@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ back ) All right . I don &apos;t know if that was neces@@ s@@ ary to de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te — ( Laughter ) — but my point is it &apos;s the sound of sel@@ f-@@ dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion .
And I &apos;ve been thinking about how that ap@@ pli@@ es across a whole spec@@ tru@@ m of re@@ al@@ ms , from , say , the eco@@ logical , o@@ kay .
There see@@ ms to be a ru@@ le in n@@ ature that if you get too clo@@ se to where you came from , it gets u@@ g@@ ly .
So like , you can &apos;t fe@@ ed co@@ ws their own bra@@ ins or you get ma@@ d co@@ w disease , and in@@ bre@@ e@@ ding and inc@@ est and , let &apos;s see , what &apos;s the other one ?
B@@ i@@ o@@ logical — there &apos;s auto@@ im@@ mun@@ e dise@@ ases , where the body at@@ tac@@ ks it@@ self a little too over@@ z@@ e@@ al@@ ously and dest@@ ro@@ ys the ho@@ st , or the person .
And then — o@@ kay , this is where we get to the son@@ g — kind of bri@@ d@@ ges the ga@@ p to the emo@@ tional .
Because al@@ though I &apos;ve used scienti@@ fic ter@@ ms in son@@ gs , it &apos;s very dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t sometimes to make them l@@ y@@ ri@@ cal .
And there &apos;s some things you just don &apos;t need to have in son@@ gs .
So I &apos;m trying to bri@@ dge this ga@@ p between this idea and this me@@ lo@@ dy .
And so , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever had this , but when I clo@@ se my eyes sometimes and try to s@@ le@@ ep , I can &apos;t stop thinking about my own eyes .
And it &apos;s like your eyes start stra@@ in@@ ing to see themselves .
That &apos;s what it fe@@ els like to me .
It &apos;s not ple@@ as@@ ant .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry if I put that idea in your head .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s im@@ possible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they see@@ m to be trying .
So that &apos;s getting a little more clo@@ ser to a person@@ al experience .
O@@ r ear@@ s being able to he@@ ar themselves — it &apos;s just im@@ possible .
That &apos;s the thing .
So , I &apos;ve been working on this son@@ g that men@@ tions these things and then also imag@@ in@@ es a person who &apos;s been so suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful at defen@@ ding themselves from hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak that they &apos;re left to do the de@@ ed themselves , if that &apos;s possible .
And that &apos;s what the son@@ g is as@@ king .

What do you do when you have a he@@ ad@@ ac@@ he ?
You s@@ wal@@ low an as@@ p@@ ir@@ in .
But for this p@@ ill to get to your head , where the pa@@ in is , it goes through your sto@@ m@@ ach , in@@ t@@ est@@ in@@ es and vari@@ ous other org@@ ans first .
And this is a big problem , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in H@@ I@@ V patients .
When they take their anti@@ -@@ H@@ I@@ V drugs , these drugs are good for lo@@ wer@@ ing the vir@@ us in the blood , and incre@@ as@@ ing the C@@ D@@ 4 cell coun@@ ts .
But they are also n@@ ot@@ ori@@ ous for their ad@@ ver@@ se side effec@@ ts , but most@@ ly bad , because they get di@@ lu@@ ted by the time they get to the blood , and wor@@ se , by the time they get to the si@@ tes where it ma@@ t@@ ters most : within the H@@ I@@ V vi@@ ral res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
These are@@ as in the body — such as the l@@ y@@ mp@@ h no@@ des , the ner@@ v@@ ous system , as well as the l@@ un@@ gs — where the vir@@ us is s@@ le@@ e@@ ping , and will not re@@ adi@@ ly get de@@ li@@ vered in the blood of patients that are under consi@@ st@@ ent anti@@ -@@ H@@ I@@ V drugs ther@@ ap@@ y .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , u@@ po@@ n dis@@ continu@@ ation of ther@@ ap@@ y , the vir@@ us can a@@ wa@@ ke and infec@@ t new cells in the blood .
Now , all this is a big problem in tre@@ ating H@@ I@@ V with the cur@@ r@@ ent drug tre@@ at@@ ment , which is a li@@ fe@@ -@@ long tre@@ at@@ ment that must be s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed by patients .
One day , I s@@ at and thought , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we de@@ li@@ ver anti@@ -@@ H@@ I@@ V direc@@ tly within its res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir si@@ tes , without the ris@@ k of drug di@@ lu@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; As a la@@ ser scienti@@ st , the answer was just before my eyes : L@@ as@@ ers , of course .
If they can be used for den@@ ti@@ stry , for diabe@@ tic wo@@ un@@ d-@@ heal@@ ing and sur@@ ger@@ y , they can be used for anything imag@@ in@@ able , inclu@@ ding trans@@ por@@ ting drugs into cells .
As a matter of fact , we are cur@@ r@@ ently using la@@ ser pul@@ ses to po@@ ke or dri@@ ll extre@@ me@@ ly tin@@ y h@@ ol@@ es , which open and clo@@ se almost im@@ medi@@ ately in H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ infec@@ ted cells , in order to de@@ li@@ ver drugs within them .
&quot; &quot; How is that possible ? &quot; &quot; you may ask .
Well , we sh@@ ine a very power@@ ful but super@@ -@@ tin@@ y la@@ ser be@@ am on@@ to the me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ e of H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ infec@@ ted cells while these cells are im@@ mer@@ sed in li@@ qui@@ d con@@ tain@@ ing the drug .
The la@@ ser pi@@ er@@ ces the cell , while the cell s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws the drug in a matter of micro@@ secon@@ ds .
Be@@ fore you even know it , the in@@ duc@@ ed ho@@ le be@@ comes im@@ medi@@ ately re@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
Now , we are cur@@ r@@ ently t@@ esting this technology in test tu@@ b@@ es or in Pe@@ tr@@ i di@@ sh@@ es , but the go@@ al is to get this technology in the human body , ap@@ p@@ ly it in the human body .
&quot; &quot; How is that possible ? &quot; &quot; you may ask .
Well , the answer is : through a th@@ ree@@ -@@ he@@ a@@ ded devi@@ ce .
U@@ sing the first head , which is our la@@ ser , we will make an inci@@ sion in the si@@ te of infec@@ tion .
U@@ sing the second head , which is a cam@@ era , we me@@ an@@ der to the si@@ te of infec@@ tion .
Fin@@ ally , using a th@@ ird head , which is a dru@@ g@@ -@@ s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing s@@ pr@@ in@@ k@@ ler , we de@@ li@@ ver the drugs direc@@ tly at the si@@ te of infec@@ tion , while the la@@ ser is again used to po@@ ke those cells open .
Well , this might not see@@ m like much right now .
But one day , if suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful , this technology can le@@ ad to comple@@ te er@@ adi@@ cation of H@@ I@@ V in the body .
Y@@ es . A cur@@ e for H@@ I@@ V .
This is every H@@ I@@ V resear@@ ch@@ er &apos;s dre@@ am — in our case , a cur@@ e le@@ ad by la@@ ser@@ s .
Thank you .

H@@ u@@ man@@ s in the developed world s@@ pen@@ d more than 90 percent of their lives in@@ do@@ ors , where they bre@@ a@@ the in and come into con@@ tac@@ t with tri@@ llions of life for@@ ms invi@@ sible to the na@@ ked ey@@ e : micro@@ org@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
B@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ ings are comple@@ x eco@@ syste@@ ms that are an important s@@ our@@ ce of micro@@ b@@ es that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
What determin@@ es the ty@@ pes and dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tions of micro@@ b@@ es in@@ do@@ ors ?
B@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ ings are co@@ lon@@ i@@ zed by a@@ ir@@ bor@@ ne micro@@ b@@ es that en@@ ter through win@@ do@@ ws and through me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal venti@@ lation syste@@ ms .
And they are b@@ rou@@ ght inside by human@@ s and other cre@@ atur@@ es .
The fa@@ te of micro@@ b@@ es in@@ do@@ ors depen@@ ds on comple@@ x interac@@ tions with human@@ s , and with the human@@ -@@ buil@@ t environment .
And today , ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ts and bio@@ logi@@ sts are working together to ex@@ pl@@ ore s@@ mar@@ t buil@@ ding desig@@ n that will create health@@ y buil@@ d@@ ings for us .
We s@@ pen@@ d an extraordin@@ ary amount of time in buil@@ d@@ ings that are extre@@ me@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led environ@@ ments , like this buil@@ ding here — environ@@ ments that have me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal venti@@ lation syste@@ ms that inclu@@ de fil@@ ter@@ ing , he@@ ating and air condi@@ tion@@ ing .
Gi@@ ven the amount of time that we s@@ pen@@ d in@@ do@@ ors , it &apos;s important to understand how this af@@ fec@@ ts our health .
A@@ t the B@@ i@@ o@@ logy and the B@@ u@@ il@@ t En@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment C@@ en@@ ter , we car@@ ri@@ ed out a study in a hospital where we sa@@ mp@@ led air and pul@@ led the DNA out of micro@@ b@@ es in the air .
And we looked at three different ty@@ pes of roo@@ ms .
We looked at roo@@ ms that were me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted , which are the data po@@ in@@ ts in the blue .
We looked at roo@@ ms that were n@@ atur@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted , where the hospital let us turn off the me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal venti@@ lation in a wing of the buil@@ ding and pr@@ y open the win@@ do@@ ws that were no lon@@ ger oper@@ able , but they made them oper@@ able for our study .
And we also sa@@ mp@@ led the out@@ do@@ or air .
If you look at the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is of this gra@@ p@@ h , you &apos;ll see that what we com@@ mon@@ ly want to do — which is ke@@ e@@ ping the out@@ do@@ ors out — we ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed that with me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal venti@@ lation .
So if you look at the green data po@@ in@@ ts , which is air that &apos;s out@@ side , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a lar@@ ge amount of micro@@ bi@@ al diversi@@ ty , or vari@@ e@@ ty of micro@@ bi@@ al ty@@ pes .
But if you look at the blue data po@@ in@@ ts , which is me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted air , it &apos;s not as diver@@ se .
But being less diver@@ se is not neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly good for our health .
If you look at the y@@ -@@ ax@@ is of this gra@@ p@@ h , you &apos;ll see that , in the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted air , you have a high@@ er probab@@ ili@@ ty of en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al path@@ o@@ gen , or ger@@ m , than if you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors .
So to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordin@@ ation diag@@ ra@@ m , which is a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal ma@@ p that te@@ lls you something about how rela@@ ted the micro@@ bi@@ al communi@@ ties are in the different sa@@ mp@@ les .
The data po@@ in@@ ts that are clo@@ ser together have micro@@ bi@@ al communi@@ ties that are more similar than data po@@ in@@ ts that are far a@@ part .
And the first things that you can see from this gra@@ p@@ h is , if you look at the blue data po@@ in@@ ts , which are the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted air , they &apos;re not simply a sub@@ set of the green data po@@ in@@ ts , which are the out@@ do@@ or air .
What we &apos;ve found is that me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally venti@@ la@@ ted air loo@@ ks like human@@ s .
It has micro@@ b@@ es on it that are com@@ mon@@ ly as@@ soci@@ ated with our sk@@ in and with our m@@ outh , our sp@@ it .
And this is because we &apos;re all con@@ stan@@ tly s@@ he@@ d@@ ding micro@@ b@@ es .
So all of you right now are shar@@ ing your micro@@ b@@ es with one another .
And when you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors , that ty@@ pe of air has micro@@ b@@ es that are com@@ mon@@ ly as@@ soci@@ ated with pl@@ ant lea@@ ves and with di@@ r@@ t .
Why does this matter ?
It ma@@ t@@ ters because the health care indu@@ stry is the second most energy inten@@ sive indu@@ stry in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
Ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als use two and a half times the amount of energy as of@@ fi@@ ce buil@@ d@@ ings .
And the mode@@ l that we &apos;re working with in ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , and also with many , many different buil@@ d@@ ings , is to keep the out@@ do@@ ors out .
And this mode@@ l may not neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly be the best for our health .
And given the extraordin@@ ary amount of no@@ so@@ comi@@ al infec@@ tions , or ho@@ sp@@ it@@ al@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infec@@ tions , this is a c@@ lue that it &apos;s a good time to re@@ consi@@ der our cur@@ r@@ ent prac@@ tic@@ es .
So just as we man@@ age national par@@ ks , where we pro@@ m@@ ote the gro@@ w@@ th of some species and we in@@ hi@@ bit the gro@@ w@@ th of others , we &apos;re working to@@ war@@ ds thinking about buil@@ d@@ ings using an eco@@ system fra@@ me@@ work where we can pro@@ m@@ ote the kinds of micro@@ b@@ es that we want to have in@@ do@@ ors .
I &apos;ve heard somebody say that you &apos;re as health@@ y as your gu@@ t .
And for this reason , many people eat pro@@ bio@@ tic y@@ o@@ gur@@ t so they can pro@@ m@@ ote a health@@ y gu@@ t fl@@ ora .
And what we ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely want to do is to be able to use this concep@@ t to pro@@ m@@ ote a health@@ y gro@@ up of micro@@ org@@ an@@ is@@ ms inside .
Thank you .

To most of you , this is a devi@@ ce to bu@@ y , se@@ ll , play games , wat@@ ch vide@@ os .
I think it might be a li@@ fel@@ ine .
I think actually it might be able to sa@@ ve more lives than pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n .
T@@ ex@@ ting : I know I say tex@@ ting and a lot of you think sex@@ ting , a lot of you think about the le@@ w@@ d phot@@ os that you see — ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly not your kids sen@@ ding to somebody else — or trying to trans@@ late the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations L@@ O@@ L , L@@ M@@ A@@ O , H@@ M@@ U .
I can help you with those later .
But the parents in the room know that tex@@ ting is actually the best way to communi@@ cate with your kids .
It might be the only way to communi@@ cate with your kids .
( Laughter ) The a@@ ver@@ age te@@ en@@ ag@@ er sen@@ ds 3@@ ,@@ 3@@ 3@@ 9 text mes@@ sa@@ ges a mon@@ th , un@@ less she &apos;s a gir@@ l , then it &apos;s clo@@ ser to 4@@ ,000 .
And the se@@ cre@@ t is she op@@ ens every single one .
T@@ ex@@ ting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really al@@ ar@@ med .
It &apos;s a 100 percent open rate even if she doesn &apos;t respon@@ d to you when you ask her when she &apos;s coming home for din@@ ner .
I pro@@ mi@@ se she read that text .
And this isn &apos;t some sub@@ ur@@ ban i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ -@@ using te@@ en ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on .
T@@ ex@@ ting actually over@@ in@@ de@@ xes for min@@ or@@ ity and ur@@ ban y@@ outh .
I know this because at D@@ o@@ So@@ me@@ th@@ ing@@ .@@ or@@ g , which is the lar@@ g@@ est organi@@ z@@ ation for te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and social change in America , about six months ago we pi@@ vo@@ ted and started fo@@ c@@ using on text mes@@ sa@@ ging .
We &apos;re now tex@@ ting out to about 200@@ ,000 kids a wee@@ k about doing our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns to make their s@@ cho@@ ols more green or to work on ho@@ me@@ less is@@ su@@ es and things like that .
We &apos;re fin@@ ding it 1@@ 1 times more power@@ ful than e@@ mai@@ l .
We &apos;ve also found an un@@ inten@@ ded conse@@ qu@@ ence .
We &apos;ve been getting text mes@@ sa@@ ges back like these .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The bo@@ ys call me fag@@ got . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was cu@@ tting , my parents found out , and so I st@@ op@@ ped .
But I just started again an h@@ our ago . &quot; &quot; O@@ r , &quot; &quot; He w@@ on &apos;t stop ra@@ ping me .
He told me not to tell any@@ one .
It &apos;s my da@@ d . A@@ re you there ? &quot; &quot; That last one &apos;s an actual text mes@@ sa@@ ge that we rece@@ i@@ ved .
And ye@@ ah , we &apos;re there .
I will not for@@ get the day we got that text mes@@ sa@@ ge .
And so it was that day that we decided we nee@@ ded to build a cri@@ sis text h@@ ot@@ line .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
K@@ i@@ ds are just sen@@ ding us these text mes@@ sa@@ ges because tex@@ ting is so famili@@ ar and com@@ for@@ table to them and there &apos;s no@@ where else to turn that they &apos;re sen@@ ding them to us .
So think about it , a text h@@ ot@@ line ; it &apos;s pretty power@@ ful .
It &apos;s f@@ ast , it &apos;s pretty priva@@ te .
No one hear@@ s you in a st@@ all , you &apos;re just tex@@ ting qui@@ e@@ tly .
It &apos;s real time .
We can help mi@@ llions of te@@ ens with coun@@ sel@@ ing and re@@ fer@@ r@@ als .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this aw@@ es@@ o@@ me is the data .
Because I &apos;m not really com@@ for@@ table just hel@@ ping that gir@@ l with coun@@ sel@@ ing and re@@ fer@@ r@@ als .
I want to pre@@ v@@ ent this sh@@ it from happen@@ ing .
So think about a co@@ p .
There &apos;s something in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
The poli@@ ce did it . It used to be just gu@@ ess work , poli@@ ce work .
And then they started cri@@ me ma@@ p@@ ping .
And so they started fol@@ lo@@ wing and wat@@ ching pe@@ tty the@@ f@@ ts , su@@ m@@ mon@@ ses , all kinds of things — char@@ ting the future es@@ senti@@ ally .
And they found things like , when you see cr@@ y@@ sta@@ l me@@ th on the stre@@ et , if you ad@@ d poli@@ ce pres@@ ence , you can cur@@ b the o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se in@@ evi@@ table s@@ pa@@ te of as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts and ro@@ b@@ ber@@ ies that would happen .
In fact , the year after the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D put Co@@ mp@@ S@@ t@@ at in place , the m@@ ur@@ der rate f@@ ell 60 percent .
So think about the data from a cri@@ sis text line .
There is no cen@@ su@@ s on bul@@ l@@ ying and da@@ ting ab@@ use and e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and cu@@ tting and ra@@ pe — no cen@@ su@@ s .
Ma@@ ybe there &apos;s some stu@@ dies , some lon@@ g@@ it@@ ud@@ in@@ al stu@@ dies , that co@@ st l@@ ots of money and took l@@ ots of time .
O@@ r maybe there &apos;s some an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al evi@@ den@@ ce .
Ima@@ g@@ ine having real time data on every one of those is@@ su@@ es .
You could in@@ form le@@ g@@ is@@ lation .
You could in@@ form school poli@@ cy .
You could say to a princi@@ p@@ al , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re having a problem every Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot; &quot; You could see the im@@ medi@@ ate impac@@ t of le@@ g@@ is@@ lation or a ha@@ te@@ ful spe@@ ec@@ h that somebody gi@@ ves in a school as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly and see what happens as a resul@@ t .
This is really , to me , the power of tex@@ ting and the power of data .
Because while people are talking about data , making it possible for F@@ ace@@ book to min@@ e my fri@@ end from the th@@ ird gra@@ de , or T@@ ar@@ get to know when it &apos;s time for me to bu@@ y more dia@@ per@@ s , or some du@@ de to build a better base@@ b@@ all te@@ am , I &apos;m actually really exci@@ ted about the power of data and the power of tex@@ ting to help that kid go to school , to help that gir@@ l stop cu@@ tting in the ba@@ th@@ room and absolu@@ tely to help that gir@@ l wh@@ ose fa@@ ther &apos;s ra@@ ping her .
Thank you .

In the s@@ pr@@ ing of 20@@ 1@@ 6 , a le@@ g@@ al bat@@ t@@ le between Ap@@ ple and the F@@ e@@ der@@ al B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u of In@@ v@@ esti@@ ga@@ tion cap@@ tu@@ red the world &apos;s attention .
Ap@@ ple has buil@@ t se@@ curi@@ ty fe@@ atur@@ es into its mo@@ bi@@ le produc@@ ts which protec@@ t data on its devi@@ ces from everyone but the o@@ w@@ ner .
That means that cri@@ min@@ als , hac@@ kers and y@@ es , even govern@@ ments are all lo@@ c@@ ked out .
For Ap@@ ple &apos;s cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers , this is a great thing .
But govern@@ ments are not so happ@@ y .
You see , Ap@@ ple has made a consci@@ ous deci@@ sion to get out of the sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance bus@@ in@@ ess .
Ap@@ ple has tri@@ ed to make sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance as dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t as possible for govern@@ ments and any other ac@@ tors .
i@@ O@@ S is made by Ap@@ ple . An@@ dro@@ id is made by Goog@@ le .
Ap@@ ple has sp@@ ent a lot of time and money to make sure that its produc@@ ts are as se@@ cur@@ e as possible .
Ap@@ ple en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ts all data sto@@ red on i@@ P@@ h@@ ones by de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t , and text mes@@ sa@@ ges s@@ ent from one Ap@@ ple cu@@ sto@@ m@@ er to another Ap@@ ple cu@@ sto@@ m@@ er are en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted by de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t without the us@@ er having to take any ac@@ tions .
What this means is that , if the poli@@ ce se@@ i@@ ze an i@@ P@@ h@@ one and it has a pas@@ s@@ word , they &apos;ll have a dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t time getting any data off of it , if they can do it at all .
In contra@@ st , the se@@ curi@@ ty of An@@ dro@@ id just really isn &apos;t as good .
So if the poli@@ ce se@@ i@@ ze an An@@ dro@@ id ph@@ one , chan@@ ces are , they &apos;ll be able to get all the data they want off of that devi@@ ce .
T@@ w@@ o s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones from two of the bi@@ gg@@ est comp@@ ani@@ es in the world ; one that protec@@ ts data by de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t , and one that doesn &apos;t .
Ap@@ ple is a se@@ ll@@ er of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y go@@ o@@ ds .
It do@@ min@@ ates the high end of the mar@@ ket .
And we would expec@@ t a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ rer of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y go@@ o@@ ds to have produc@@ ts that inclu@@ de more fe@@ atur@@ es .
But not everyone can af@@ for@@ d an i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
But the do@@ min@@ ance of An@@ dro@@ id has led to what I call the &quot; &quot; di@@ gi@@ tal se@@ curi@@ ty divi@@ de . &quot; &quot; That is , there is now incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly a ga@@ p between the pri@@ vac@@ y and se@@ curi@@ ty of the ri@@ ch , who can af@@ for@@ d devi@@ ces that se@@ cur@@ e their data by de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t , and of the po@@ or , wh@@ ose devi@@ ces do very little to protec@@ t them by de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t .
So , think of the a@@ ver@@ age Ap@@ ple cu@@ sto@@ m@@ er : a ban@@ ker , a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , a doc@@ tor , a poli@@ tici@@ an .
These individu@@ als now incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly have s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts that en@@ cr@@ y@@ pt their cal@@ ls , their text mes@@ sa@@ ges , all the data on the devi@@ ce , without them doing really anything to se@@ cur@@ e their information .
In contra@@ st , the po@@ or and the most vulner@@ able in our socie@@ ties are using devi@@ ces that lea@@ ve them comple@@ tely vulner@@ able to sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
In the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , where I live , A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans are more li@@ ke@@ ly to be seen as s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous or more li@@ ke@@ ly to be pro@@ fi@@ led , and are more li@@ ke@@ ly to be tar@@ ge@@ ted by the sta@@ te with sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
But A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans are also dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately li@@ ke@@ ly to use An@@ dro@@ id devi@@ ces that do nothing at all to protec@@ t them from that sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
This is a problem .
We must remember that sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance is a to@@ ol .
It &apos;s a to@@ ol used by those in power aga@@ in@@ st those who have no power .
And while I think it &apos;s absolu@@ tely great that comp@@ ani@@ es like Ap@@ ple are making it e@@ as@@ y for people to en@@ cr@@ y@@ pt , if the only people who can protec@@ t themselves from the ga@@ ze of the government are the ri@@ ch and power@@ ful , that &apos;s a problem .
And it &apos;s not just a pri@@ vac@@ y or a cy@@ ber@@ se@@ curi@@ ty problem .
It &apos;s a ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts problem .
So the lack of de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t se@@ curi@@ ty in An@@ dro@@ id is not just a problem for the po@@ or and vulner@@ able us@@ ers who are depen@@ ding on these devi@@ ces .
This is actually a problem for our democra@@ cy .
I &apos;ll ex@@ pla@@ in what I mean .
Mo@@ der@@ n social mo@@ ve@@ ments re@@ ly on technology — from B@@ lack Li@@ ves M@@ at@@ ter to the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to O@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ y W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et .
The organi@@ z@@ ers of these mo@@ ve@@ ments and the me@@ mb@@ ers of these mo@@ ve@@ ments incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly communi@@ cate and co@@ ordin@@ ate with s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones .
And so , n@@ atur@@ ally govern@@ ments that feel th@@ re@@ aten@@ ed by these mo@@ ve@@ ments will also tar@@ get the organi@@ z@@ ers and their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones .
Now , it &apos;s quite possible that a future Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing or a Man@@ dela or a G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i will have an i@@ P@@ h@@ one and be protec@@ ted from government sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
Thank you .
( Applause ) H@@ el@@ en W@@ al@@ ters : Ch@@ r@@ is , th@@ ank you so much .
I have a question for you .
We saw rec@@ ently in the pres@@ s that Mar@@ k Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g from F@@ ace@@ book co@@ ver@@ s over his cam@@ era and does something with his he@@ ad@@ ph@@ one mic j@@ ack .
So I wanted to ask you a person@@ al question , which is : D@@ o you do that ?
And , on be@@ half of everyone here , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly myself , S@@ h@@ ould we be doing that ?
S@@ h@@ ould we be co@@ ver@@ ing these things ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ op@@ her So@@ gh@@ o@@ i@@ an : P@@ u@@ tting a stic@@ ker — actually , I like B@@ an@@ d-@@ A@@ i@@ ds , because you can re@@ move them and put them back on wh@@ en@@ ever you want to make a call or a S@@ k@@ y@@ pe call .
There really is mal@@ w@@ are , m@@ ali@@ ci@@ ous sof@@ tw@@ are out there that can take over your we@@ b ca@@ m , even without the light tur@@ ning on .
This is used by cri@@ min@@ als . This is used by st@@ al@@ kers .
You can bu@@ y $ 19@@ .@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; sp@@ y on your ex@@ -@@ gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &quot; &quot; sof@@ tw@@ are on@@ line .
It &apos;s really terri@@ f@@ ying .
And then , of course , it &apos;s used by govern@@ ments .
And there &apos;s obvi@@ ously a se@@ xu@@ al viol@@ ence com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which is that this kind of sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance can be used most effec@@ tively aga@@ in@@ st wo@@ men and other people who can be s@@ ha@@ med in our socie@@ ty .

I &apos;m an eco@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , most@@ ly a coral ree@@ f eco@@ lo@@ g@@ ist .
I started out in Ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke B@@ ay and went di@@ ving in the win@@ ter and became a tro@@ pi@@ cal eco@@ lo@@ g@@ ist over@@ ni@@ ght .
And it was really a lot of f@@ un for about 10 years .
I mean , somebody pa@@ ys you to go around and tra@@ vel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the plan@@ et .
And that was what I did .
And I en@@ ded up in J@@ ama@@ ica , in the W@@ est In@@ dies , where the coral re@@ ef@@ s were really a@@ mon@@ g the most extraordin@@ ary , struc@@ tur@@ ally , that I ever saw in my life .
And this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it sho@@ ws two things : F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s in black and whi@@ te because the water was so c@@ lear and you could see so far , and fil@@ m was so s@@ low in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s and early 7@@ 0@@ s , you took pic@@ tures in black and whi@@ te .
The other thing it sho@@ ws you is that , al@@ though there &apos;s this beautiful for@@ est of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
Th@@ ose re@@ ef@@ s at D@@ is@@ co@@ very B@@ ay , J@@ ama@@ ica were the most stu@@ died coral re@@ ef@@ s in the world for 20 years .
We were the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test .
People came to study our re@@ ef@@ s from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , which is sort of fun@@ ny because now we go to the@@ ir@@ s .
And the vie@@ w of scienti@@ sts about how coral re@@ ef@@ s work , how they ou@@ ght to be , was based on these re@@ ef@@ s without any fish .
Then , in 19@@ 80 , there was a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , H@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e A@@ ll@@ en .
I put half the lab up in my house .
The w@@ ind b@@ le@@ w very st@@ rong .
The wa@@ ves were 25 to 50 fe@@ et high .
And the re@@ ef@@ s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed , and new is@@ lan@@ ds for@@ med , and we thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re real s@@ mar@@ t .
We know that h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ es have always happened in the pa@@ st . &quot; &quot; And we publi@@ sh@@ ed a pa@@ per in S@@ ci@@ ence , the first time that any@@ body ever descri@@ bed the dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion on a coral ree@@ f by a ma@@ j@@ or h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
And we pre@@ dic@@ ted what would happen , and we got it all wrong .
And the reason was because of over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing , and the fact that a last common gra@@ z@@ er , a sea ur@@ ch@@ in , died .
And within a few months after that sea ur@@ ch@@ in d@@ ying , the se@@ a@@ we@@ ed started to grow .
And that is the same ree@@ f ; that &apos;s the same ree@@ f 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same ree@@ f today .
The coral re@@ ef@@ s of the nor@@ th co@@ ast of J@@ ama@@ ica have a few percent live coral co@@ ver and a lot of se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and sli@@ me .
And that &apos;s more or less the story of the coral re@@ ef@@ s of the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , tra@@ g@@ ic@@ ally , the coral re@@ ef@@ s wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
Now , that &apos;s my little , depres@@ sing story .
All of us in our 6@@ 0@@ s and 7@@ 0@@ s have compar@@ able depres@@ sing stories .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ j@@ ure up much of a sense of w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being , because it just ke@@ e@@ ps getting wor@@ se .
And the reason it ke@@ e@@ ps getting wor@@ se is that after a natural ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he , like a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , it used to be that there was some kind of suc@@ ces@@ sion@@ al se@@ qu@@ ence of reco@@ very , but what &apos;s going on now is that over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing and po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion and climate change are all interac@@ ting in a way that pre@@ v@@ ents that .
And so I &apos;m going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
We he@@ ar a lot about the col@@ la@@ p@@ se of co@@ d .
It &apos;s dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to imagine that two , or some histori@@ ans would say three world war@@ s were f@@ ou@@ ght dur@@ ing the co@@ lon@@ ial era for the control of co@@ d .
C@@ od f@@ ed most of the people of W@@ est@@ er@@ n Europe .
It f@@ ed the s@@ la@@ ves b@@ rou@@ ght to the An@@ ti@@ lles , the son@@ g &quot; &quot; J@@ ama@@ ica F@@ are@@ well &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ ke@@ e ri@@ ce sal@@ t fish are n@@ ice &quot; &quot; — is an e@@ mb@@ le@@ m of the import@@ ance of sal@@ t co@@ d from nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n Can@@ ada .
It all col@@ la@@ p@@ sed in the 8@@ 0@@ s and the 9@@ 0@@ s : 3@@ 5@@ ,000 people lost their j@@ ob@@ s .
And that was the beg@@ in@@ ning of a kind of seri@@ al de@@ ple@@ tion from bi@@ gg@@ er and ta@@ sti@@ er species to s@@ mal@@ ler and n@@ ot@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ ta@@ st@@ y species , from species that were ne@@ ar to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
It &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Co@@ st@@ co in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes and bu@@ y che@@ a@@ p fish .
You ou@@ ght to read the la@@ bel to find out where it came from , but it &apos;s still che@@ a@@ p , and every@@ body thin@@ ks it &apos;s o@@ kay .
It &apos;s hard to communi@@ cate this , and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about s@@ port fish , because people like to go out and ca@@ t@@ ch fish .
It &apos;s one of those things .
This picture here sho@@ ws the tro@@ ph@@ y fish , the bi@@ gg@@ est fish ca@@ u@@ ght by people who pa@@ y a lot of money to get on a bo@@ at , go to a place off of K@@ ey W@@ est in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , dr@@ in@@ k a lot of be@@ er , th@@ row a lot of ho@@ o@@ ks and lin@@ es into the water , come back with the bi@@ gg@@ est and the best fish , and the cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on tro@@ ph@@ y fish are put on this bo@@ ard , where people take a picture , and this guy is obvi@@ ously really exci@@ ted about that fish .
Well , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like now , but this is what it was like in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s from the same bo@@ at in the same place on the same bo@@ ard on the same do@@ ck .
The tro@@ ph@@ y fish were so big that you coul@@ dn &apos;t put any of those small fish up on it .
And the a@@ ver@@ age size tro@@ ph@@ y fish we@@ i@@ gh@@ ed 2@@ 50 to 3@@ 00 po@@ unds , go@@ li@@ ath g@@ rou@@ per , and if you wanted to go out and k@@ ill something , you could pretty much coun@@ t on being able to ca@@ t@@ ch one of those fish .
And they tas@@ ted really good .
And people pa@@ id less in 19@@ 50 dollars to ca@@ t@@ ch that than what people pa@@ y now to ca@@ t@@ ch those little , tin@@ y fish .
And that &apos;s every@@ where .
It &apos;s not just the fish , though , that are disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing .
In@@ du@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing us@@ es big stuff , big mach@@ in@@ er@@ y .
We use ne@@ ts that are 20 miles long .
We use lon@@ g@@ lin@@ es that have one million or two million ho@@ o@@ ks .
And we tra@@ w@@ l , which means to take something the size of a tra@@ c@@ tor tra@@ il@@ er tr@@ uc@@ k that we@@ i@@ gh@@ s thousands and thousands of po@@ unds , put it on a big cha@@ in , and dra@@ g it across the sea flo@@ or to sti@@ r up the bot@@ to@@ m and ca@@ t@@ ch the fish .
Th@@ in@@ k of it as being kind of the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zing of a city or of a for@@ est , because it c@@ lear@@ s it away .
And the hab@@ it@@ at dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion is un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
This is a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h , a ty@@ pi@@ cal phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h , of what the contin@@ en@@ tal sh@@ el@@ ves of the world look like .
You can see the ro@@ ws in the bot@@ to@@ m , the way you can see the ro@@ ws in a fiel@@ d that has just been p@@ low@@ ed to pl@@ ant cor@@ n .
What that was , was a for@@ est of s@@ pon@@ ges and coral , which is a cri@@ tical hab@@ it@@ at for the develo@@ p@@ ment of fish .
What it is now is mu@@ d , and the are@@ a of the ocean flo@@ or that has been trans@@ for@@ med from for@@ est to level mu@@ d , to par@@ king lot , is equi@@ val@@ ent to the entire are@@ a of all the for@@ est@@ s that have ever been c@@ ut down on all of the ear@@ th in the hist@@ ory of human@@ ity .
We &apos;ve man@@ ag@@ ed to do that in the last 100 to 1@@ 50 years .
We ten@@ d to think of oil spi@@ lls and mer@@ cur@@ y and we he@@ ar a lot about pla@@ stic these days .
And all of that stuff is really dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing , but what &apos;s really in@@ si@@ di@@ ous is the bio@@ logical po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion that happens because of the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of the shi@@ f@@ ts that it caus@@ es to entire eco@@ syste@@ ms .
And I &apos;m going to just talk very bri@@ ef@@ ly about two kinds of bio@@ logical po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion : one is in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed species and the other is what comes from nu@@ tri@@ ents .
So this is the in@@ fa@@ mous C@@ a@@ ul@@ er@@ pa ta@@ xi@@ fo@@ li@@ a , the so@@ -@@ called ki@@ ll@@ er al@@ ga@@ e .
A book was wri@@ t@@ ten about it .
It &apos;s a bit of an e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
It was ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally re@@ lea@@ sed from the aqu@@ ari@@ um in M@@ on@@ ac@@ o , it was bre@@ d to be co@@ ld to@@ ler@@ ant to have in pe@@ op@@ les aqu@@ aria .
It &apos;s very pretty , and it has ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly started to over@@ grow the on@@ ce very ri@@ ch bio@@ diversi@@ ty of the nor@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember the mo@@ vi@@ e &quot; The L@@ it@@ t@@ le S@@ ho@@ p of H@@ or@@ r@@ ors , &quot; but this is the pl@@ ant of &quot; &quot; The L@@ it@@ t@@ le S@@ ho@@ p of H@@ or@@ r@@ ors . &quot; &quot; But , instead of de@@ v@@ our@@ ing the people in the sho@@ p , what it &apos;s doing is over@@ gro@@ wing and s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ing vir@@ tu@@ ally all of the bot@@ to@@ m@@ -@@ d@@ w@@ el@@ ling life of the entire nor@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an Se@@ a .
We don &apos;t know anything that e@@ at@@ s it , we &apos;re trying to do all sor@@ ts of gene@@ tics and figur@@ e out something that could be done , but , as it stan@@ ds , it &apos;s the mon@@ s@@ ter from h@@ ell , about which no@@ body kno@@ ws what to do .
Now another form of po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion that &apos;s bio@@ logical po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion is what happens from ex@@ cess nu@@ tri@@ ents .
The green re@@ volu@@ tion , all of this arti@@ fici@@ al n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen fer@@ tili@@ z@@ er , we use too much of it .
It &apos;s sub@@ si@@ di@@ zed , which is one of the reas@@ ons we used too much of it .
It r@@ uns down the ri@@ ver@@ s , and it fe@@ e@@ ds the plan@@ k@@ ton , the little micro@@ s@@ co@@ pi@@ c pl@@ ant cells in the co@@ as@@ tal water .
But sin@@ ce we ate all the o@@ y@@ st@@ ers and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
And when it dies , it fal@@ ls to the bot@@ to@@ m and then it r@@ ots , which means that bacteria bre@@ ak it down .
And in the process they use up all the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , and in using up all the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen they make the environment u@@ tter@@ ly le@@ th@@ al for anything that can &apos;t s@@ wi@@ m away .
So , what we end up with is a micro@@ bi@@ al z@@ o@@ o do@@ min@@ ated by bacteria and j@@ el@@ l@@ y@@ fish , as you see on the left in front of you .
And the only fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y left — and it is a com@@ mer@@ cial fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y — is the j@@ el@@ l@@ y@@ fish fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y you see on the right , where there used to be pra@@ w@@ ns .
E@@ ven in Ne@@ w@@ fo@@ und@@ land where we used to ca@@ t@@ ch co@@ d , we now have a j@@ el@@ l@@ y@@ fish fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y .
And another ver@@ sion of this sort of thing is what is of@@ ten called red ti@@ des or to@@ xi@@ c bloo@@ ms .
That picture on the left is just sta@@ gg@@ er@@ ing to me .
I have tal@@ ked about it a million times , but it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
In the u@@ p@@ per right of that picture on the left is almost the M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i D@@ el@@ ta , and the lo@@ wer left of that picture is the T@@ ex@@ as@@ -@@ M@@ ex@@ ico bor@@ der .
You &apos;re looking at the entire nor@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ico ; you &apos;re looking at one to@@ xi@@ c din@@ of@@ la@@ g@@ el@@ late bloo@@ m that can k@@ ill fish , made by that beautiful little cre@@ ature on the lo@@ wer right .
And in the u@@ p@@ per right you see this black sort of cl@@ ou@@ d mo@@ ving as@@ hor@@ e .
That &apos;s the same species .
And as it comes to sh@@ ore and the w@@ ind blo@@ ws , and little dro@@ ple@@ ts of the water get into the air , the emer@@ gen@@ cy roo@@ ms of all the ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als fi@@ ll up with people with ac@@ u@@ te res@@ pira@@ t@@ ory dist@@ ress .
And that &apos;s re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ho@@ mes on the w@@ est co@@ ast of F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
A fri@@ end and I did this thing in H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od we called H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od ocean ni@@ ght , and I was trying to figur@@ e out how to ex@@ pla@@ in to ac@@ tors what &apos;s going on .
And I said , &quot; &quot; So , imagine you &apos;re in a mo@@ vi@@ e called &apos; Es@@ ca@@ pe from M@@ ali@@ b@@ u &apos; because all the beautiful people have mo@@ ved to Nor@@ th D@@ a@@ k@@ ot@@ a , where it &apos;s c@@ le@@ an and sa@@ fe .
And the only people who are left there are the people who can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to move away from the co@@ ast , because the co@@ ast , instead of being par@@ adi@@ se , is har@@ m@@ ful to your health . &quot; &quot; And then this is amazing .
It was when I was on ho@@ li@@ day last early au@@ tu@@ m@@ n in Fran@@ ce .
This is from the co@@ ast of Bri@@ tt@@ any , which is being en@@ velo@@ ped in this green , alg@@ al sli@@ me .
The reason that it at@@ tra@@ c@@ ted so much attention , b@@ esi@@ des the fact that it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing , is that sea bir@@ ds fl@@ ying over it are as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ated by the s@@ me@@ ll and di@@ e , and a far@@ m@@ er died of it , and you can imagine the s@@ can@@ da@@ l that happened .
And so there &apos;s this w@@ ar between the far@@ m@@ ers and the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men about it all , and the net resul@@ t is that the be@@ ach@@ es of Bri@@ tt@@ any have to be bul@@ l@@ do@@ zed of this stuff on a regu@@ lar bas@@ is .
And then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
I gu@@ ess the i@@ con@@ ic figur@@ e of it is the mel@@ ting of the ice in the Ar@@ c@@ tic Se@@ a .
Th@@ in@@ k about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ as@@ sa@@ ge .
Well , the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ as@@ sa@@ ge is already there .
I think it &apos;s sort of fun@@ ny ; it &apos;s on the S@@ i@@ ber@@ i@@ an co@@ ast , maybe the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans will char@@ ge to@@ lls .
The govern@@ ments of the world are taking this really seri@@ ously .
The mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y of the Ar@@ c@@ tic na@@ tions is taking it really seri@@ ously .
For all the den@@ ial of climate change by government lea@@ ders , the C@@ I@@ A and the na@@ vi@@ es of Nor@@ way and the U.@@ S@@ . and Can@@ ada , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver are bu@@ si@@ ly thinking about how they will se@@ cur@@ e their terri@@ t@@ ory in this in@@ evi@@ ta@@ bility from their point of vie@@ w .
And , of course , Ar@@ c@@ tic communi@@ ties are to@@ ast .
The other kinds of effec@@ ts of climate change — this is coral b@@ le@@ ach@@ ing . It &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
All that whi@@ te coral .
Ex@@ cep@@ t it &apos;s sup@@ pos@@ ed to be bro@@ wn .
What happens is that the cor@@ als are a sy@@ mbi@@ o@@ sis , and they have these little alg@@ al cells that live inside them .
And the al@@ ga@@ e give the cor@@ als su@@ gar , and the cor@@ als give the al@@ ga@@ e nu@@ tri@@ ents and protec@@ tion .
But when it gets too ho@@ t , the al@@ ga@@ e can &apos;t make the su@@ gar .
The cor@@ als say , &quot; &quot; You che@@ ated . You didn &apos;t pa@@ y your r@@ ent . &quot; &quot; They k@@ ick them out , and then they di@@ e .
No@@ t all of them di@@ e ; some of them sur@@ vi@@ ve , some more are sur@@ vi@@ ving , but it &apos;s really bad news .
To try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go camp@@ ing in J@@ u@@ ly some@@ where in Europe or in Nor@@ th America , and you wa@@ ke up the next mor@@ ning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the tre@@ es , as far as you can see , have dro@@ p@@ ped their lea@@ ves and are stan@@ ding there na@@ ked .
And you come home , and you disco@@ ver that 80 percent of all the tre@@ es in Nor@@ th America and in Europe have dro@@ p@@ ped their lea@@ ves .
And then you read in the pa@@ per a few wee@@ ks later , &quot; Oh , by the way , a qu@@ ar@@ ter of those died . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s what happened in the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an dur@@ ing the 19@@ 9@@ 8 E@@ l N@@ ino , an are@@ a va@@ st@@ ly gre@@ ater than the size of Nor@@ th America and Europe , when 80 percent of all the cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them died .
And then the really s@@ car@@ y thing about all of this — the over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing , the po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion and the climate change — is that each thing doesn &apos;t happen in a vac@@ u@@ um .
But there are these , what we call , posi@@ tive fe@@ e@@ d@@ bac@@ ks , the sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ es a@@ mon@@ g them that make the whole va@@ st@@ ly gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts .
And the great scienti@@ fic ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put H@@ u@@ mp@@ ty D@@ u@@ mp@@ ty back together again ?
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protec@@ t it .
But what does that mean ?
We really don &apos;t know .
So what are the oce@@ ans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
Well , there w@@ on &apos;t be any fish ex@@ cep@@ t for min@@ no@@ ws , and the water will be pretty di@@ r@@ ty , and all those kinds of things and full of mer@@ cur@@ y , et@@ c . , et@@ c .
And de@@ ad z@@ ones will get bi@@ gg@@ er and bi@@ gg@@ er and they &apos;ll start to mer@@ ge , and we can imagine something like the de@@ ad@@ -@@ zon@@ i@@ fi@@ cation of the global , co@@ as@@ tal ocean .
Then you sure w@@ on &apos;t want to eat fish that were rai@@ sed in it , because it would be a kind of ga@@ st@@ ro@@ no@@ mic R@@ us@@ si@@ an rou@@ le@@ t@@ te .
So@@ me@@ times you have a to@@ xi@@ c bloo@@ m ; sometimes you don &apos;t .
That doesn &apos;t se@@ ll .
The really s@@ car@@ y things though are the physical , che@@ mi@@ cal , oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c things that are happen@@ ing .
As the sur@@ face of the ocean gets war@@ m@@ er , the water is li@@ ghter when it &apos;s war@@ m@@ er , it be@@ comes har@@ der and har@@ der to turn the ocean over .
We say it be@@ comes more st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly stra@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed .
The conse@@ qu@@ ence of that is that all those nu@@ tri@@ ents that fu@@ el the great an@@ cho@@ ve@@ ta fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies , of the s@@ ar@@ din@@ es of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a or in Per@@ u or w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver , those s@@ low down and those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies col@@ la@@ p@@ se .
And , at the same time , water from the sur@@ face , which is ri@@ ch in o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean tur@@ ns into a des@@ er@@ t .
So the question is : How are we all going to respon@@ d to this ?
And we can do all sor@@ ts of things to fi@@ x it , but in the final anal@@ y@@ sis , the thing we really need to fi@@ x is ourselves .
It &apos;s not about the fish ; it &apos;s not about the po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion ; it &apos;s not about the climate change .
It &apos;s about us and our gre@@ ed and our need for gro@@ w@@ th and our in@@ ability to imagine a world that is different from the sel@@ fish world we live in today .
So the question is : W@@ ill we respon@@ d to this or not ?
I would say that the future of life and the di@@ gn@@ ity of human be@@ ings depen@@ ds on our doing that .
Thank you . ( Applause )
So we were up on top of our bun@@ k be@@ ds .
That &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because I can just de@@ le@@ te that do@@ t .
I can de@@ le@@ te that do@@ t because that &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly a meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment er@@ ro@@ r .
I &apos;d like to talk today about how we can change our bra@@ ins and our socie@@ ty .
M@@ e@@ et Jo@@ e .
Jo@@ e &apos;s 3@@ 2 years old and a m@@ ur@@ der@@ er .
I &apos;d like you to imagine this place .
What la@@ y at the roo@@ t of their behavi@@ or ?
W@@ as there a neuro@@ logical cause for their condi@@ tion ?
So I &apos;d like to spe@@ ak about change , and especi@@ ally about emo@@ tional change .
A@@ t the age of five or six I would cre@@ ep up in my pa@@ j@@ a@@ mas and si@@ t out@@ side with my e@@ ar g@@ lu@@ ed to the do@@ or .
And I sup@@ pos@@ e that &apos;s how I found myself wal@@ king into the se@@ cur@@ e inter@@ vie@@ w room on my first day at W@@ or@@ m@@ wo@@ od S@@ cru@@ b@@ s .
Jo@@ e s@@ at across a ste@@ el table and gre@@ e@@ ted me with this b@@ lan@@ k expres@@ sion .
The pri@@ son war@@ den , looking equ@@ ally in@@ different , said , &quot; &quot; An@@ y t@@ rou@@ ble , just pres@@ s the red bu@@ z@@ z@@ er , and we &apos;ll be around as so@@ on as we can . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I s@@ at down .
The he@@ av@@ y me@@ tal do@@ or s@@ la@@ m@@ med sh@@ ut be@@ hind me .
( Laughter ) I looked at Jo@@ e .
Wh@@ il@@ st the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ pa@@ ths in our study were able to descri@@ be the pic@@ tures ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely , they fa@@ i@@ led to show the emo@@ tions re@@ qui@@ red .
They fa@@ i@@ led to show a physical respon@@ se .
It was as though they knew the words but not the music of em@@ path@@ y .
So we wanted to look clo@@ ser at this to use M@@ R@@ I to ima@@ ge their bra@@ ins .
That tur@@ ned out to be not such an e@@ as@@ y tas@@ k .
Af@@ ter some time , ho@@ we@@ ver , we had a ten@@ ta@@ tive answer .
These individu@@ als were not just the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms of a t@@ rou@@ b@@ led chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
There was something else .
People like Jo@@ e have a de@@ fici@@ t in a brain are@@ a called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a .
The am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is an al@@ mon@@ d-@@ s@@ ha@@ ped org@@ an de@@ ep within each of the he@@ mis@@ ph@@ er@@ es of the brain .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , the more em@@ path@@ ic a person is , the lar@@ ger and more ac@@ tive their am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is .
So let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing moral behavi@@ or is simply part of gro@@ wing up , like learning to spe@@ ak .
The fact that this develo@@ p@@ mental pro@@ g@@ res@@ sion is univer@@ sa@@ l , ir@@ res@@ pec@@ tive of where you live in the world or which culture you in@@ hab@@ it , st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions of moral behavi@@ or are in@@ bor@@ n .
If you dou@@ b@@ t this , try , as I &apos;ve done , to ren@@ e@@ ge on a pro@@ mi@@ se you &apos;ve made to a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -old .
It is more a@@ k@@ in to a S@@ wis@@ s ar@@ my k@@ ni@@ fe with fix@@ ed mental mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es fin@@ e@@ ly hon@@ ed dur@@ ing develo@@ p@@ ment and a shar@@ p sense of fa@@ ir@@ ness .
The early years are cru@@ cial .
There see@@ ms to be a win@@ do@@ w of op@@ port@@ un@@ ity , after which ma@@ ster@@ ing moral ques@@ tions be@@ comes more dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t , like adul@@ ts learning a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n language .
That &apos;s not to say it &apos;s im@@ possible .
So can bra@@ ins change ?
For over 100 years , neuro@@ an@@ ato@@ mi@@ sts and later neuro@@ scienti@@ sts hel@@ d the vie@@ w that after ini@@ ti@@ al develo@@ p@@ ment in chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , no new brain cells could grow in the adul@@ t human brain .
The brain could only change within cer@@ tain set limi@@ ts .
That was the do@@ g@@ ma .
Now , they don &apos;t develo@@ p mor@@ ality to the point of car@@ r@@ ying the sho@@ p@@ ping b@@ ag@@ s of little old mi@@ ce across the stre@@ et , but their impro@@ ved environment resul@@ ts in health@@ y , soci@@ able behavi@@ or .
In some are@@ as of the brain , more than 20 percent of cells are ne@@ w@@ ly for@@ med .
We &apos;re just beg@@ in@@ ning to understand what exac@@ t func@@ tion these cells have , but what it imp@@ li@@ es is that the brain is cap@@ able of extraordin@@ ary change way into adul@@ th@@ o@@ od .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last deca@@ de sub@@ jec@@ ting myself to pa@@ in and hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation , ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly for a good cause , which is sel@@ f-@@ impro@@ ve@@ ment .
And I &apos;ve done this in three par@@ ts .
So first I started with the mind .
And I decided to try to get s@@ mar@@ ter by read@@ ing the entire En@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Bri@@ tan@@ n@@ ica from A to Z — or , more preci@@ se@@ ly , from &quot; &quot; a@@ -@@ ak &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Z@@ y@@ wi@@ e@@ c . &quot; &quot; And here &apos;s a little ima@@ ge of that .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fas@@ cin@@ ating j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
It was pa@@ in@@ ful at times , especi@@ ally for those around me .
My wi@@ fe started to fin@@ e me one dol@@ lar for every ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant fact I in@@ ser@@ ted into conversa@@ tion .
So it had its do@@ w@@ n@@ si@@ des .
But after that , I decided to work on the spi@@ ri@@ t .
As I men@@ tion@@ ed last year , I gre@@ w up with no reli@@ gi@@ on at all .
I &apos;m J@@ e@@ wis@@ h , but I &apos;m J@@ e@@ wis@@ h in the same way the O@@ live G@@ ar@@ den is I@@ t@@ ali@@ an .
( Laughter ) No@@ t really .
But I decided to learn about the B@@ i@@ ble and my her@@ i@@ ta@@ ge by actually di@@ ving in and trying to live it and im@@ mer@@ se myself in it .
So I decided to fol@@ low all the r@@ ul@@ es of the B@@ i@@ ble .
And from the Ten Co@@ m@@ man@@ d@@ ments to gro@@ wing my be@@ ard — because Le@@ vi@@ tic@@ us says you cannot s@@ have .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that reac@@ tion .
( Laughter ) I look a little like Mo@@ ses , or T@@ ed K@@ ac@@ z@@ y@@ n@@ sk@@ i .
I got both of them .
So there was the to@@ pi@@ ary there .
And there &apos;s the s@@ he@@ ep .
Now the final part of the tri@@ logy was I wanted to fo@@ c@@ us on the body and try to be the health@@ i@@ est person I could be , the health@@ i@@ est person ali@@ ve .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing the last cou@@ ple of years .
And I just fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed a cou@@ ple of months ago .
And I have to say , th@@ ank God .
Because living so health@@ i@@ ly was ki@@ lling me .
( Laughter ) It was so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling .
I was listen@@ ing to all the ex@@ per@@ ts and talking to sort of a bo@@ ard of medical ad@@ vi@@ ser@@ s .
And they were telling me all the things I had to do .
I had to eat right , exer@@ ci@@ se , medi@@ ta@@ te , pe@@ t do@@ gs , because that low@@ ers the blood pres@@ sure .
I w@@ r@@ ote the book on a tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ ll , and it took me about a thou@@ s@@ and miles to wri@@ te the book .
I had to put on s@@ un@@ s@@ cre@@ en .
This was no small fe@@ at , because if you li@@ ste@@ n to der@@ ma@@ to@@ logi@@ sts , they say that you should have a sho@@ t g@@ la@@ ss full of s@@ un@@ s@@ cre@@ en .
And you have to re@@ ap@@ p@@ ly it every two to four h@@ our@@ s .
So I think half of my book ad@@ v@@ ance went into s@@ un@@ s@@ cre@@ en .
I was like a g@@ la@@ zed dou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut for most of the year .
There was the was@@ hing of han@@ ds .
I had to do that pro@@ per@@ ly .
And my im@@ mun@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ist told me that I should also wi@@ pe down all of the re@@ m@@ ote contro@@ ls and i@@ P@@ h@@ ones in my house , because those are just or@@ gi@@ es of ger@@ ms .
So that took a lot of time .
I also tri@@ ed to be the sa@@ f@@ est person I could be , because that &apos;s a part of health .
I was in@@ spi@@ red by the D@@ an@@ is@@ h Sa@@ fe@@ ty Co@@ un@@ cil .
They started a publi@@ c cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n that says , &quot; &quot; A wal@@ king hel@@ me@@ t is a good hel@@ me@@ t . &quot; &quot; So they believe you should not just we@@ ar hel@@ me@@ ts for bi@@ king , but also for wal@@ king around .
And you can see there they &apos;re sho@@ p@@ ping with their hel@@ me@@ ts .
( Laughter ) Well ye@@ ah , I tri@@ ed that .
Now it &apos;s a little extre@@ me , I ad@@ mi@@ t .
But if you think about this , this is actually — the &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ mi@@ cs &quot; &quot; au@@ th@@ ors w@@ r@@ ote about this — that more people di@@ e on a per mi@@ le bas@@ is from dr@@ un@@ k wal@@ king than from dr@@ un@@ k dri@@ ving .
So something to think about ton@@ ight if you &apos;ve had a cou@@ ple .
So I fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , and it was a suc@@ cess in a sense .
All of the mar@@ kers went in the right direc@@ tion .
My ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol went down , I lost we@@ ight , my wi@@ fe st@@ op@@ ped telling me that I looked pre@@ gn@@ ant .
So that was n@@ ice .
And it was suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful over@@ all .
But I also learned that I was too health@@ y , and that was un@@ health@@ y .
I was so fo@@ cu@@ sed on doing all these things that I was ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ting my fri@@ ends and family .
And as D@@ an B@@ u@@ e@@ tt@@ ner can tell you , having a st@@ rong social ne@@ t@@ work is so cru@@ cial to our health .
So I fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
And I kind of went over@@ bo@@ ard on the wee@@ k after the project was over .
I went to the dar@@ k side , and I just in@@ d@@ ul@@ ged myself .
It was like something out of C@@ ali@@ g@@ ul@@ a .
( Laughter ) W@@ i@@ th@@ out the se@@ x part .
Because I have three young kids , so that was@@ n &apos;t happen@@ ing .
But the over@@ -@@ e@@ ating and over@@ -@@ dr@@ in@@ king , defini@@ tely .
And I finally have sta@@ bili@@ zed .
So now I &apos;m back to ado@@ p@@ ting many — not all ; I don &apos;t we@@ ar a hel@@ me@@ t any@@ more — but do@@ z@@ ens of health@@ y behavi@@ ors that I ado@@ p@@ ted dur@@ ing my year .
It was really a li@@ fe@@ -@@ chan@@ ging project .
And I , of course , don &apos;t have time to go into all of them .
Let me just tell you two really qu@@ ick@@ ly .
The first is — and this was sur@@ pri@@ sing to me ; I didn &apos;t expec@@ t this to come out — but I live a much qui@@ e@@ ter life now .
Because we live in such a no@@ is@@ y world .
There &apos;s tra@@ ins and plan@@ es and car@@ s and B@@ ill O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , he &apos;s very no@@ is@@ y .
( Laughter ) And this is a real under@@ esti@@ ma@@ ted , under@@ -@@ ap@@ preci@@ ated health ha@@ z@@ ard — not just because it har@@ ms our hear@@ ing , which it obvi@@ ously does , but it actually ini@@ ti@@ ates the fi@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ f@@ light respon@@ se .
A l@@ ou@@ d noi@@ se will get your fi@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ f@@ light respon@@ se going .
And this , over the years , can cause real da@@ ma@@ ge , car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cular da@@ ma@@ ge .
The W@@ or@@ ld H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ z@@ ation just did a big study that they publi@@ sh@@ ed this year .
And it was done in Europe .
And they esti@@ ma@@ ted that 1@@ .@@ 6 million years of health@@ y living are lost every year in Europe because of noi@@ se po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion .
So they think it &apos;s actually very de@@ ad@@ ly .
And by the way , it &apos;s also terri@@ ble for your brain .
It really im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s co@@ gni@@ tion .
And our Fo@@ un@@ ding F@@ a@@ thers knew about this .
When they w@@ r@@ ote the Con@@ stitu@@ tion , they put di@@ r@@ t all over the co@@ b@@ b@@ l@@ est@@ ones out@@ side the h@@ all so that they could con@@ cent@@ rate .
So without noi@@ se re@@ duc@@ tion technology , our country would not exis@@ t .
So as a pa@@ tri@@ o@@ t , I fel@@ t it was important to — I we@@ ar all the ear@@ p@@ lu@@ gs and the ear@@ ph@@ ones , and it &apos;s really impro@@ ved my life in a sur@@ pri@@ sing and un@@ expec@@ ted way .
And the second point I want to make , the final point , is that — and it &apos;s actually been a the@@ me of TE@@ D@@ M@@ E@@ D — that jo@@ y is so important to your health , that very few of these behavi@@ ors will stic@@ k with me un@@ less there &apos;s some sense of ple@@ as@@ ure and jo@@ y in them .
And just to give you one inst@@ ance of this : food .
The j@@ un@@ k food indu@@ stry is really great at pres@@ sing our ple@@ as@@ ure bu@@ tt@@ ons and figur@@ ing out what &apos;s the most ple@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble .
But I think we can use their tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es and ap@@ p@@ ly them to health@@ y food .
To give just one example , we love cr@@ un@@ ch@@ in@@ ess , m@@ ou@@ th@@ feel .
So I basi@@ cally have tri@@ ed to in@@ cor@@ po@@ rate cr@@ un@@ ch@@ in@@ ess into a lot of my reci@@ pes — th@@ row in some s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer see@@ ds .
And you can almost tri@@ ck yourself into thinking you &apos;re e@@ ating D@@ or@@ itos .
( Laughter ) And it has made me a health@@ i@@ er person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in A@@ pri@@ l .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ ro@@ p De@@ ad H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y . &quot; &quot; And I hope that I don &apos;t get si@@ ck dur@@ ing the book t@@ our .
That &apos;s my gre@@ at@@ est hope .
So th@@ ank you very much .
( Applause )
G@@ o@@ od mor@@ ning . How are you ?
I have an inter@@ est in education .
And yet we &apos;re me@@ ant to be edu@@ ca@@ ting them for it .
S@@ ha@@ k@@ espe@@ are being se@@ ven ?
I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my da@@ u@@ ghter &apos;s 1@@ 6 .
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles .
They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life .
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into compar@@ t@@ ments .
Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
If I &apos;m co@@ o@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed .
Ta@@ ke her to a d@@ ance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was .
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was full of people like me .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
The human vo@@ ice : It &apos;s the instru@@ ment we all play .
It &apos;s the most power@@ ful sound in the world , probably .
It &apos;s the only one that can start a w@@ ar or say &quot; &quot; I love you . &quot; &quot; And yet many people have the experience that when they spe@@ ak , people don &apos;t li@@ ste@@ n to them .
And why is that ?
How can we spe@@ ak power@@ ful@@ ly to make change in the world ?
What I &apos;d like to su@@ gg@@ est , there are a number of hab@@ its that we need to move away from .
I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding this is an ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tive li@@ st , but these se@@ ven , I think , are pretty lar@@ ge hab@@ its that we can all f@@ all into .
F@@ ir@@ st , go@@ s@@ si@@ p .
S@@ pe@@ a@@ king ill of somebody who &apos;s not present .
No@@ t a n@@ ice hab@@ it , and we know perfec@@ tly well the person go@@ s@@ si@@ ping , five minu@@ tes later , will be go@@ s@@ si@@ ping about us .
Se@@ con@@ d , j@@ ud@@ ging .
We know people who are like this in conversa@@ tion , and it &apos;s very hard to li@@ ste@@ n to somebody if you know that you &apos;re being j@@ ud@@ ged and found wan@@ ting at the same time .
Th@@ ird , ne@@ ga@@ tivi@@ ty .
You can f@@ all into this .
My mother , in the last years of her life , became very ne@@ ga@@ tive , and it &apos;s hard to li@@ ste@@ n .
I remember one day , I said to her , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 1 today , &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; I know , isn &apos;t it dre@@ ad@@ ful ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s hard to li@@ ste@@ n when somebody &apos;s that ne@@ ga@@ tive . ( Laughter )
And another form of ne@@ ga@@ tivi@@ ty , com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing .
Well , this is the national art of the U.@@ K@@ .
It &apos;s our national s@@ port .
We com@@ pla@@ in about the we@@ a@@ ther , s@@ port , about poli@@ tics , about everything , but actually , com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing is vi@@ ral mi@@ ser@@ y .
It &apos;s not s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing s@@ un@@ sh@@ ine and li@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the world .
Ex@@ c@@ us@@ es .
We &apos;ve all me@@ t this guy .
Ma@@ ybe we &apos;ve all been this guy .
So@@ me people have a b@@ la@@ me@@ th@@ ro@@ wer .
They just pas@@ s it on to every@@ body else and don &apos;t take respon@@ si@@ bility for their ac@@ tions , and again , hard to li@@ ste@@ n to somebody who is being like that .
Pen@@ ul@@ ti@@ mate , the si@@ x@@ th of the se@@ ven , e@@ mb@@ ro@@ i@@ der@@ y , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
It de@@ means our language , actually , sometimes .
For example , if I see something that really is aw@@ es@@ o@@ me , what do I call it ?
( Laughter ) And then , of course , this ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation be@@ comes l@@ ying , and we don &apos;t want to li@@ ste@@ n to people we know are l@@ ying to us .
And finally , do@@ g@@ ma@@ tis@@ m .
The con@@ fu@@ sion of fac@@ ts with op@@ ini@@ ons .
When those two things get con@@ f@@ la@@ ted , you &apos;re listen@@ ing into the w@@ ind .
You know , somebody is bo@@ mb@@ ar@@ ding you with their op@@ ini@@ ons as if they were true .
It &apos;s dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to li@@ ste@@ n to that .
So here they are , se@@ ven de@@ ad@@ ly sin@@ s of spe@@ a@@ king .
These are things I think we need to a@@ vo@@ id .
But is there a posi@@ tive way to think about this ?
Y@@ es , there is .
I &apos;d like to su@@ gg@@ est that there are four really power@@ ful cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones , fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions , that we can st@@ and on if we want our spe@@ ec@@ h to be power@@ ful and to make change in the world .
F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately , these things spe@@ ll a word .
The word is &quot; &quot; ha@@ il , &quot; &quot; and it has a great defini@@ tion as well .
I &apos;m not talking about the stuff that fal@@ ls from the sk@@ y and h@@ its you on the head .
I &apos;m talking about this defini@@ tion , to gre@@ et or ac@@ cla@@ i@@ m en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tically , which is how I think our words will be rece@@ i@@ ved if we st@@ and on these four things .
So what do they st@@ and for ?
Se@@ e if you can gu@@ ess .
The H , hon@@ est@@ y , of course , being true in what you say , being stra@@ ight and c@@ lear .
The A is au@@ th@@ enti@@ city , just being yourself .
A fri@@ end of min@@ e descri@@ bed it as stan@@ ding in your own tru@@ th , which I think is a lo@@ vely way to put it .
The I is inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty , being your word , actually doing what you say , and being somebody people can tr@@ ust .
And the L is love .
I don &apos;t mean ro@@ man@@ tic love , but I do mean wis@@ hing people well , for two reas@@ ons .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , I think absolu@@ te hon@@ est@@ y may not be what we want .
I mean , my go@@ o@@ d@@ ness , you look u@@ g@@ ly this mor@@ ning .
Per@@ haps that &apos;s not neces@@ s@@ ary .
T@@ em@@ per@@ ed with love , of course , hon@@ est@@ y is a great thing .
But also , if you &apos;re really wis@@ hing somebody well , it &apos;s very hard to j@@ ud@@ ge them at the same time .
I &apos;m not even sure you can do those two things si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously .
So ha@@ il .
Al@@ so , now that &apos;s what you say , and it &apos;s like the old son@@ g , it is what you say , it &apos;s also the way that you say it .
You have an amazing to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x .
This instru@@ ment is incre@@ di@@ ble , and yet this is a to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that very few people have ever op@@ en@@ ed .
I &apos;d like to have a little ru@@ m@@ ma@@ ge in there with you now and just pul@@ l a few to@@ ols out that you might like to take away and play with , which will incre@@ ase the power of your spe@@ a@@ king .
Re@@ g@@ is@@ ter , for example .
Now , fal@@ se@@ t@@ to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter may not be very u@@ se@@ ful most of the time , but there &apos;s a re@@ g@@ is@@ ter in between .
I &apos;m not going to get very tech@@ ni@@ cal about this for any of you who are vo@@ ice co@@ ach@@ es .
You can lo@@ cate your vo@@ ice , ho@@ we@@ ver .
So if I talk up here in my no@@ se , you can he@@ ar the differ@@ ence .
If I go down here in my th@@ ro@@ at , which is where most of us spe@@ ak from most of the time .
But if you want we@@ ight , you need to go down here to the ch@@ est .
You he@@ ar the differ@@ ence ?
We v@@ ote for poli@@ tici@@ ans with lo@@ wer vo@@ ic@@ es , it &apos;s true , because we as@@ soci@@ ate de@@ p@@ th with power and with au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
That &apos;s re@@ g@@ is@@ ter .
Then we have ti@@ m@@ bre .
It &apos;s the way your vo@@ ice fe@@ els .
A@@ ga@@ in , the research sho@@ ws that we pre@@ fer vo@@ ic@@ es which are ri@@ ch , s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , war@@ m , like ho@@ t cho@@ co@@ late .
Well if that &apos;s not you , that &apos;s not the end of the world , because you can tra@@ in .
G@@ o and get a vo@@ ice co@@ ach .
And there are amazing things you can do with bre@@ a@@ thing , with pos@@ ture , and with exer@@ ci@@ ses to impro@@ ve the ti@@ m@@ bre of your vo@@ ice .
Then pro@@ so@@ dy . I love pro@@ so@@ dy .
This is the sing@@ -@@ son@@ g , the meta@@ -@@ language that we use in order to im@@ part me@@ an@@ ing .
It &apos;s roo@@ t one for me@@ an@@ ing in conversa@@ tion .
People who spe@@ ak all on one n@@ ote are really quite hard to li@@ ste@@ n to if they don &apos;t have any pro@@ so@@ dy at all .
That &apos;s where the word &quot; &quot; mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ic &quot; &quot; comes from , or mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous , mon@@ ot@@ one .
Al@@ so , we have re@@ peti@@ tive pro@@ so@@ dy now coming in , where every s@@ ent@@ ence ends as if it were a question when it &apos;s actually not a question , it &apos;s a sta@@ te@@ ment ?
( Laughter ) And if you re@@ pe@@ at that one , it &apos;s actually r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ ting your ability to communi@@ cate through pro@@ so@@ dy , which I think is a s@@ ha@@ me , so let &apos;s try and bre@@ ak that hab@@ it .
P@@ ace .
I can get very exci@@ ted by saying something really qu@@ ick@@ ly , or I can s@@ low right down to emp@@ ha@@ size , and at the end of that , of course , is our old fri@@ end si@@ l@@ ence .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with a bit of si@@ l@@ ence in a talk , is there ?
We don &apos;t have to fi@@ ll it with u@@ ms and a@@ h@@ s .
It can be very power@@ ful .
O@@ f course , p@@ it@@ ch of@@ ten goes al@@ ong with p@@ ace to indi@@ cate ar@@ ou@@ sa@@ l , but you can do it just with p@@ it@@ ch .
Wh@@ ere did you lea@@ ve my ke@@ ys ?
( H@@ i@@ gh@@ er p@@ it@@ ch ) Wh@@ ere did you lea@@ ve my ke@@ ys ?
So , sli@@ gh@@ tly different me@@ an@@ ing in those two de@@ li@@ ver@@ ies .
And finally , volu@@ me .
( L@@ ou@@ d ) I can get really exci@@ ted by using volu@@ me .
S@@ or@@ ry about that , if I star@@ t@@ led any@@ body .
O@@ r , I can have you really pa@@ y attention by getting very qui@@ et .
So@@ me people bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st the whole time .
T@@ ry not to do that .
That &apos;s called so@@ d@@ ca@@ st@@ ing , ( Laughter ) I@@ m@@ pos@@ ing your sound on people around you car@@ el@@ es@@ s@@ ly and in@@ consider@@ ately .
No@@ t n@@ ice .
O@@ f course , where this all comes into play most of all is when you &apos;ve got something really important to do .
It might be stan@@ ding on a sta@@ ge like this and gi@@ ving a talk to people .
It might be pro@@ pos@@ ing mar@@ ri@@ age , as@@ king for a rai@@ se , a we@@ d@@ ding spe@@ ec@@ h .
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it is , if it &apos;s really important , you o@@ we it to yourself to look at this to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x and the eng@@ ine that it &apos;s going to work on , and no eng@@ ine works well without being war@@ med up .
W@@ ar@@ m up your vo@@ ice .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , let me show you how to do that .
W@@ ould you all like to st@@ and up for a moment ?
I &apos;m going to show you the six vo@@ cal war@@ m@@ -@@ up exer@@ ci@@ ses that I do before every talk I ever do .
An@@ y time you &apos;re going to talk to any@@ body important , do these .
F@@ ir@@ st , ar@@ ms up , de@@ ep bre@@ ath in , and si@@ gh out , a@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , like that .
One more time .
A@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , very good .
Now we &apos;re going to war@@ m up our li@@ ps , and we &apos;re going to go B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a , B@@ a . V@@ er@@ y good .
And now , br@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r , just like when you were a kid .
B@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r . Now your li@@ ps should be coming ali@@ ve .
We &apos;re going to do the ton@@ gue next with ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la .
Be@@ auti@@ ful . You &apos;re getting really good at this .
And then , ro@@ ll an R@@ . R@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r .
That &apos;s like cha@@ m@@ pa@@ g@@ ne for the ton@@ gue .
Fin@@ ally , and if I can only do one , the pr@@ os call this the si@@ ren .
It &apos;s really good . It star@@ ts with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and goes to &quot; &quot; a@@ w . &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; is high , the &quot; &quot; a@@ w &quot; &quot; is low .
So you go , wee@@ e@@ a@@ aw@@ w@@ w , wee@@ e@@ a@@ aw@@ w@@ w .
F@@ an@@ ta@@ stic . Gi@@ ve your@@ selves a ro@@ und of ap@@ plause .
Ta@@ ke a se@@ at , th@@ ank you .
( Applause ) N@@ ext time you spe@@ ak , do those in ad@@ v@@ ance .
Now let me just put this in con@@ text to clo@@ se .
This is a seri@@ ous point here .
This is where we are now , right ?
We spe@@ ak not very well to people who simply ar@@ en &apos;t listen@@ ing in an environment that &apos;s all about noi@@ se and bad a@@ cous@@ tics .
I have tal@@ ked about that on this sta@@ ge in different p@@ ha@@ ses .
What would the world be like if we were spe@@ a@@ king power@@ ful@@ ly to people who were listen@@ ing consci@@ ously in environ@@ ments which were actually f@@ it for pur@@ pos@@ e ?
O@@ r to make that a bit lar@@ ger , what would the world be like if we were cre@@ ating sound consci@@ ously and consu@@ ming sound consci@@ ously and desig@@ ning all our environ@@ ments consci@@ ously for sound ?
That would be a world that does sound beautiful , and one where underst@@ an@@ ding would be the nor@@ m , and that is an idea wor@@ th s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We all know how to ma@@ in@@ tain our physical health and how to prac@@ tice den@@ tal hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , right ?
We &apos;ve kno@@ wn it sin@@ ce we were five years old .
Why ? Because of po@@ or emo@@ tional hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
C@@ an I say how de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted I am to be away from the cal@@ m of W@@ est@@ min@@ s@@ ter and W@@ hi@@ te@@ h@@ all ? ( Laughter ) This is K@@ i@@ m , a n@@ in@@ e@@ -@@ year@@ -old Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m gir@@ l , her back ru@@ in@@ ed by na@@ pal@@ m , and she a@@ wa@@ k@@ en@@ ed the consci@@ ence of the na@@ tion of America to beg@@ in to end the Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar .
This is B@@ ir@@ ha@@ n , who was the E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ i@@ an gir@@ l who la@@ un@@ ched Li@@ ve A@@ id in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , 15 minu@@ tes away from death when she was res@@ cu@@ ed , and that picture of her being res@@ cu@@ ed is one that went ro@@ und the world .
This is Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are .
A man before a tan@@ k became a picture that became a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l for the whole world of resist@@ ance .
This next is the S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese gir@@ l , a few mo@@ ments from death , a vul@@ ture ho@@ ver@@ ing in the bac@@ k@@ ground , a picture that went ro@@ und the world and sho@@ c@@ ked people into ac@@ tion on po@@ ver@@ ty .
This is Ne@@ da , the I@@ ran@@ i@@ an gir@@ l who was sho@@ t while at a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion with her fa@@ ther in I@@ ran only a few wee@@ ks ago , and she is now the fo@@ c@@ us , ri@@ gh@@ tly so , of the Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be gener@@ ation .
And what do all these pic@@ tures and ev@@ ents have in common ?
What they have in common is what we see un@@ lo@@ c@@ ks what we cannot see .
What we see un@@ lo@@ c@@ ks the invi@@ sible ties and bon@@ ds of sy@@ m@@ path@@ y that br@@ ing us together to become a human commun@@ ity .
What these pic@@ tures de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te is that we do feel the pa@@ in of others , ho@@ we@@ ver dist@@ an@@ tly .
What I think these pic@@ tures de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te is that we do believe in something bi@@ gg@@ er than ourselves .
What these pic@@ tures de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te is that there is a moral sense across all reli@@ gi@@ ons , across all fa@@ i@@ ths , across all contin@@ ents — a moral sense that not only do we share the pa@@ in of others , and believe in something bi@@ gg@@ er than ourselves but we have a du@@ ty to ac@@ t when we see things that are wrong that need ri@@ gh@@ ted , see in@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es that need to be correc@@ ted , see problems that need to be rec@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed .
There is a story about O@@ l@@ of P@@ al@@ me , the S@@ we@@ dis@@ h Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter , going to see R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an in America in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
Be@@ fore he ar@@ ri@@ ved R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an said — and he was the S@@ we@@ dis@@ h So@@ cial De@@ mo@@ cra@@ tic Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter — &quot; Is@@ n ’ t this man a commun@@ ist ? &quot;
The re@@ p@@ ly was , &quot; &quot; No , M@@ r P@@ res@@ id@@ ent , he ’ s an anti@@ -@@ commun@@ ist . &quot; &quot; And R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an said , &quot; &quot; I don ’ t care what kind of commun@@ ist he is ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an asked O@@ l@@ of P@@ al@@ me , the So@@ cial De@@ mo@@ cra@@ tic Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of S@@ we@@ den , &quot; Well , what do you believe in ? D@@ o you want to ab@@ oli@@ sh the ri@@ ch ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to ab@@ oli@@ sh the po@@ or . &quot; &quot; Ou@@ r respon@@ si@@ bility is to let everyone have the chan@@ ce to realiz@@ e their po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to the full .
I believe there is a moral sense and a global e@@ th@@ ic that com@@ man@@ ds attention from people of every reli@@ gi@@ on and every fa@@ ith , and people of no fa@@ ith .
But I think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capaci@@ ty to communi@@ cate in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ously across fron@@ ti@@ ers right across the world .
We now have the capaci@@ ty to find common ground with people who we will never me@@ et , but who we will me@@ et through the Internet and through all the moder@@ n means of communi@@ cation ; that we now have the capaci@@ ty to organi@@ ze and take col@@ lec@@ tive ac@@ tion together to de@@ al with the problem or an in@@ j@@ us@@ tice that we want to de@@ al with ; and I believe that this makes this a uni@@ que age in human hist@@ ory , and it is the start of what I would call the cre@@ ation of a tru@@ ly global socie@@ ty .
G@@ o back 200 years when the s@@ la@@ ve tra@@ de was under pres@@ sure from W@@ il@@ li@@ am W@@ il@@ ber@@ for@@ ce and all the pr@@ ot@@ est@@ ers .
They pr@@ ot@@ es@@ ted across Bri@@ tain .
They w@@ on publi@@ c op@@ ini@@ on over a long peri@@ od of time .
But it took 2@@ 4 years for the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to be suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful .
What could they have done with the pic@@ tures that they could have sho@@ wn if they were able to use the moder@@ n means of communi@@ cation to w@@ in people ’ s hear@@ ts and min@@ ds ?
O@@ r if you take E@@ g@@ lan@@ ty@@ ne J@@ e@@ b@@ b , the woman who cre@@ ated Sa@@ ve the Ch@@ il@@ dren 90 years ago .
She was so ap@@ pal@@ led by what was happen@@ ing in Au@@ stri@@ a as a resul@@ t of the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar and what was happen@@ ing to children who were part of the de@@ fe@@ ated famili@@ es of Au@@ stri@@ a , that in Bri@@ tain she wanted to take ac@@ tion , but she had to go house to house , le@@ af@@ let to le@@ af@@ let , to get people to atten@@ d a r@@ ally in the R@@ o@@ y@@ al Al@@ ber@@ t H@@ all that ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally ga@@ ve bir@@ th to Sa@@ ve the Ch@@ il@@ dren , an inter@@ national organi@@ z@@ ation that is now ful@@ ly recogni@@ zed as one of the great institu@@ tions in our land and in the world .
But what more could she have done if she ’ d had the moder@@ n means of communi@@ ca@@ tions a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to her to create a sense that the in@@ j@@ us@@ tice that people saw had to be ac@@ ted u@@ po@@ n im@@ medi@@ ately ?
Now look at what ’ s happened in the last 10 years .
In P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ in@@ es in 200@@ 1 , P@@ res@@ id@@ ent Est@@ ra@@ da — a million people tex@@ ted each other about the cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion of that re@@ gi@@ me , ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally b@@ rou@@ ght it down and it was , of course , called the &quot; &quot; co@@ up de text . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then you have in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we the first elec@@ tion under R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e a year ago .
Because people were able to take mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s of what was happen@@ ing at the po@@ lling sta@@ tions , it was im@@ possible for that Pre@@ mi@@ er to fi@@ x that elec@@ tion in the way that he wanted to do .
O@@ r take B@@ ur@@ ma and the mon@@ ks that were blo@@ gg@@ ing out , a country that no@@ body knew anything about that was happen@@ ing , until these blo@@ gs told the world that there was a repres@@ sion , me@@ an@@ ing that lives were being lost and people were being per@@ se@@ cu@@ ted and A@@ un@@ g S@@ an Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i , who is one of the great pri@@ son@@ ers of consci@@ ence of the world , had to be listen@@ ed to .
Then take I@@ ran it@@ self , and what people are doing today : fol@@ lo@@ wing what happened to Ne@@ da , people who are pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing the se@@ curi@@ ty ser@@ vi@@ ces of I@@ ran fin@@ ding those people who are blo@@ gg@@ ing out of I@@ ran , any by every@@ body who is blo@@ gg@@ ing , chan@@ ging their ad@@ d@@ ress to T@@ e@@ h@@ ran , I@@ ran , and making it dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t for the se@@ curi@@ ty ser@@ vi@@ ces .
Ta@@ ke , ther@@ e@@ fore , what moder@@ n technology is cap@@ able of : the power of our moral sense al@@ li@@ ed to the power of communi@@ ca@@ tions and our ability to organi@@ ze inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally .
That , in my vie@@ w , gi@@ ves us the first op@@ port@@ un@@ ity as a commun@@ ity to funda@@ ment@@ ally change the world .
Fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n poli@@ cy can never be the same again . It cannot be r@@ un by eli@@ tes ; it ’ s got to be r@@ un by listen@@ ing to the publi@@ c op@@ ini@@ ons of pe@@ op@@ les who are blo@@ gg@@ ing , who are communi@@ ca@@ ting with each other around the world .
200 years ago the problem we had to sol@@ ve was s@@ la@@ very .
1@@ 50 years ago I sup@@ pos@@ e the ma@@ in problem in a country like our@@ s was how young people , children , had the right to education .
100 years ago in most countries in Europe , the pres@@ sure was for the right to v@@ ote .
50 years ago the pres@@ sure was for the right to social se@@ curi@@ ty and w@@ el@@ f@@ are .
In the last 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 60 years we have seen fas@@ ci@@ s@@ m , anti@@ -@@ Se@@ mi@@ tis@@ m , ra@@ ci@@ s@@ m , apar@@ the@@ id , dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation on the bas@@ is of se@@ x and gen@@ der and se@@ xu@@ ality ; all these have come under pres@@ sure because of the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns that have been r@@ un by people to change the world .
I was with N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela a year ago , when he was in L@@ on@@ don .
I was at a con@@ cer@@ t that he was atten@@ ding to mar@@ k his bir@@ th@@ day and for the cre@@ ation of new res@@ our@@ ces for his fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion .
I was si@@ tting next to N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela — I was very pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to do so — when A@@ my W@@ in@@ e@@ house came on@@ to the sta@@ ge . ( Laughter ) And N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela was quite sur@@ pri@@ sed at the ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance of the sing@@ er and I was ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing to him at the time who she was .
A@@ my W@@ in@@ e@@ house said , &quot; &quot; N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela and I have a lot in common .
My h@@ us@@ b@@ and too has sp@@ ent a long time in pri@@ son . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela then went down to the sta@@ ge and he su@@ mm@@ ari@@ zed the ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge for us all .
He said in his li@@ fe@@ time he had cli@@ m@@ bed a great moun@@ tain , the moun@@ tain of ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ing and then de@@ fe@@ ating ra@@ cial op@@ pres@@ sion and de@@ fe@@ ating apar@@ the@@ id .
He said that there was a gre@@ ater ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge a@@ head , the ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge of po@@ ver@@ ty , of climate change — global ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es that nee@@ ded global solu@@ tions and nee@@ ded the cre@@ ation of a tru@@ ly global socie@@ ty .
We are the first gener@@ ation which is in a posi@@ tion to do this .
Co@@ mb@@ ine the power of a global e@@ th@@ ic with the power of our ability to communi@@ cate and organi@@ ze glob@@ ally , with the ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es that we now face , most of which are global in their n@@ ature .
C@@ li@@ mate change cannot be sol@@ ved in one country , but has got to be sol@@ ved by the world working together .
A finan@@ cial cri@@ sis , just as we have seen , could not be sol@@ ved by America al@@ one or Europe al@@ one ; it nee@@ ded the world to work together .
Ta@@ ke the problems of se@@ curi@@ ty and ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and , equ@@ ally , the problem of human ri@@ ghts and develo@@ p@@ ment : they cannot be sol@@ ved by Africa al@@ one ; they cannot be sol@@ ved by America or Europe al@@ one .
We cannot sol@@ ve these problems un@@ less we work together .
So the great project of our gener@@ ation , it see@@ ms to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global e@@ th@@ ic and our global ability to communi@@ cate and organi@@ ze together , a tru@@ ly global socie@@ ty , buil@@ t on that e@@ th@@ ic but with institu@@ tions that can ser@@ ve that global socie@@ ty and make for a different future .
We have now , and are the first gener@@ ation with , the power to do this .
Ta@@ ke climate change . I@@ s it not absolu@@ tely s@@ can@@ d@@ al@@ ous that we have a situ@@ ation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more res@@ our@@ ces to the po@@ or@@ est countries to de@@ al with that , when we want to create a global car@@ b@@ on mar@@ ket , but there is no global institu@@ tion that people have been able to ag@@ ree u@@ po@@ n to de@@ al with this problem ?
One of the things that has got to come out of C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the next few months is an ag@@ ree@@ ment that there will be a global environ@@ mental institu@@ tion that is able to de@@ al with the problems of per@@ su@@ ad@@ ing the whole of the world to move al@@ ong a cli@@ mate@@ -@@ change ag@@ en@@ da .
( Applause ) One of the reas@@ ons why an institu@@ tion is not in it@@ self enough is that we have got to per@@ su@@ ade people around the world to change their behavi@@ or as well , so you need that global e@@ th@@ ic of fa@@ ir@@ ness and respon@@ si@@ bility across the gener@@ ations .
Ta@@ ke the finan@@ cial cri@@ sis .
If people in po@@ o@@ rer countries can be h@@ it by a cri@@ sis that star@@ ts in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k or star@@ ts in the sub@@ -@@ pri@@ me mar@@ ket of the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes of America .
If people can find that that sub@@ -@@ pri@@ me produc@@ t has been trans@@ fer@@ red across na@@ tions many , many times until it ends up in ban@@ ks in I@@ cel@@ and or the res@@ t in Bri@@ tain , and people &apos;s ordin@@ ary sa@@ v@@ ings are af@@ fec@@ ted by it , then you cannot re@@ ly on a system of national super@@ vi@@ sion .
You need in the long r@@ un for sta@@ bility , for econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th , for j@@ ob@@ s , as well as for finan@@ cial sta@@ bility , global econo@@ mic institu@@ tions that make sure that gro@@ w@@ th to be s@@ us@@ tain@@ ed has to be shar@@ ed , and are buil@@ t on the princi@@ ple that the pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity of this world is indi@@ vi@@ sible .
So another ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge for our gener@@ ation is to create global institu@@ tions that ref@@ lec@@ t our ideas of fa@@ ir@@ ness and respon@@ si@@ bility , not the ideas that were the bas@@ is of the last sta@@ ge of finan@@ cial develo@@ p@@ ment over these rec@@ ent years .
Then take develo@@ p@@ ment and take the par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship we need between our countries and the res@@ t of the world , the po@@ or@@ est part of the world .
We do not have the bas@@ is of a pro@@ per par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship for the future , and yet , out of people ’ s des@@ i@@ re for a global e@@ th@@ ic and a global socie@@ ty that can be done .
I have just been talking to the P@@ res@@ id@@ ent of S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one .
This is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doc@@ tors ; it has 200 n@@ ur@@ ses ; it has 1@@ 20 mi@@ d@@ wi@@ ves .
You cannot beg@@ in to build a health@@ care system for six million people with such limi@@ ted res@@ our@@ ces .
O@@ r take the gir@@ l I me@@ t when I was in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia , a gir@@ l called Mi@@ ri@@ am .
She was 1@@ 1 years old ; her parents had both died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S , her mother and then her fa@@ ther .
She was an A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ p@@ ha@@ n being han@@ ded across different ex@@ ten@@ ded famili@@ es to be car@@ ed for .
She her@@ self was suf@@ fer@@ ing from H@@ I@@ V ; she was suf@@ fer@@ ing from tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
I me@@ t her in a fiel@@ d , she was ra@@ gg@@ ed , she had no sho@@ es .
When you looked in her eyes , any gir@@ l at the age of ele@@ ven is looking for@@ ward to the future , but there was an un@@ reac@@ ha@@ ble sa@@ d@@ ness in that gir@@ l ’ s eyes and if I could have trans@@ la@@ ted that to the res@@ t of the world for that moment , I believe that all the work that it had done for the global H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ und would be re@@ war@@ ded by people being pre@@ par@@ ed to make don@@ ations .
We must then build a pro@@ per rela@@ tion@@ ship between the ri@@ ch@@ est and the po@@ or@@ est countries based on our des@@ i@@ re that they are able to f@@ end for themselves with the inv@@ est@@ ment that is neces@@ s@@ ary in their ag@@ ri@@ culture , so that Africa is not a net im@@ por@@ ter of food , but an ex@@ por@@ ter of food .
Ta@@ ke the problems of human ri@@ ghts and the problems of se@@ curi@@ ty in so many countries around the world .
B@@ ur@@ ma is in cha@@ ins , Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we is a human tra@@ ge@@ dy , in Su@@ dan thousands of people have died un@@ neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly for war@@ s that we could pre@@ v@@ ent .
In the R@@ wan@@ da Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Mu@@ se@@ um , there is a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h of a 10@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y and the Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Mu@@ se@@ um is com@@ memor@@ ating the lives that were lost in the R@@ wan@@ dan gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de where a million people died .
There is a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h of a bo@@ y called David .
B@@ esi@@ de that phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; &quot; David , age 10 . &quot; &quot; David : ambi@@ tion to be a doc@@ tor .
F@@ av@@ ori@@ te s@@ port : fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all . What did he en@@ jo@@ y most ?
Ma@@ king people la@@ u@@ gh .
How did he di@@ e ?
T@@ or@@ tu@@ red to death .
L@@ ast words said to his mother who was also tor@@ tu@@ red to death : &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry . The Uni@@ ted Na@@ tions are coming . &quot;
And we never did .
And that young bo@@ y belie@@ ved our pro@@ mi@@ ses that we would help people in dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty in R@@ wan@@ da , and we never did .
So we have got to create in this world also institu@@ tions for pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ e@@ ping and human@@ it@@ ari@@ an a@@ id , but also for re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion and se@@ curi@@ ty for some of the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den sta@@ tes of the world .
So my ar@@ gu@@ ment today is basi@@ cally this .
We have the means by which we could create a tru@@ ly global socie@@ ty .
The institu@@ tions of this global socie@@ ty can be cre@@ ated by our en@@ de@@ av@@ ors .
That global e@@ th@@ ic can inf@@ use the fa@@ ir@@ ness and respon@@ si@@ bility that is neces@@ s@@ ary for these institu@@ tions to work , but we should not lo@@ se the chan@@ ce in this gener@@ ation , in this deca@@ de in particular , with P@@ res@@ id@@ ent O@@ ba@@ ma in America , with other people working with us around the world , to create global institu@@ tions for the environment , and for fin@@ ance , and for se@@ curi@@ ty and for develo@@ p@@ ment , that make sense of our respon@@ si@@ bility to other pe@@ op@@ les , our des@@ i@@ re to bin@@ d the world together , and our need to tac@@ k@@ le problems that every@@ body kno@@ ws exis@@ t .
It is said that in An@@ ci@@ ent R@@ o@@ me that when C@@ ic@@ ero s@@ po@@ ke to his audi@@ ences , people used to turn to each other and say about C@@ ic@@ ero , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at spe@@ ec@@ h . &quot; &quot; But it is said that in An@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ece when De@@ mos@@ th@@ en@@ es s@@ po@@ ke to his audi@@ ences , people tur@@ ned to each other and didn ’ t say &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at spe@@ ec@@ h . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s mar@@ ch . &quot; &quot; We should be mar@@ ching to@@ war@@ ds a global socie@@ ty .
Thank you .

Ha@@ ve you ever wanted to sta@@ y young a little lon@@ ger and put off aging ?
This is a dre@@ am of the ages .
But scienti@@ sts have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
They thought you just we@@ ar out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it — kind of like an old sho@@ e .
But if you look in n@@ ature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ ans .
Now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
So that su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that some@@ where in these genes , some@@ where in the DNA , are genes for aging , genes that al@@ low them to have different li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ ans .
So if there are genes like that , then you can imagine that , if you could change one of the genes in an experi@@ ment , an aging gene , maybe you could s@@ low down aging and ex@@ ten@@ d li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
And if you could do that , then you could find the genes for aging .
And if they exis@@ t and you can find them , then maybe one could ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally do something about it .
So we &apos;ve set out to look for genes that control aging .
And we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
In@@ stead , we stu@@ died a little , tin@@ y , ro@@ und wor@@ m called C@@ . ele@@ g@@ ans , which is just about the size of a com@@ ma in a s@@ ent@@ ence .
And we were really op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic that we could find something because there had been a re@@ port of a lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved mu@@ t@@ ant .
So we started to change genes at ran@@ dom , looking for lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved animals .
And we were very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to find that mu@@ ta@@ tions that da@@ ma@@ ge one single gene called da@@ f-@@ 2 dou@@ b@@ led the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of the little wor@@ m .
So you can see in black , after a mon@@ th — they &apos;re very sh@@ or@@ t@@ -@@ li@@ ved ; that &apos;s why we like to study them for stu@@ dies of aging — in black , after a mon@@ th , the normal wor@@ ms are all de@@ ad .
But at that time , most of the mu@@ t@@ ant wor@@ ms are still ali@@ ve .
And it isn &apos;t until tw@@ ice as long that they &apos;re all de@@ ad .
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this mo@@ vi@@ e here .
So the first thing you &apos;re going to see is the normal wor@@ m when it &apos;s about colle@@ ge stud@@ ent age — a young adul@@ t .
It &apos;s quite a cu@@ te little fel@@ low .
And next you &apos;re going to see the lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved mu@@ t@@ ant when it &apos;s young .
So this animal is going to live tw@@ ice as long .
I@@ s it mi@@ ser@@ able ? It doesn &apos;t see@@ m to be .
It &apos;s ac@@ tive . You can &apos;t tell the differ@@ ence really .
And they can be comple@@ tely fer@@ ti@@ le — have the same number of pro@@ gen@@ y as the normal wor@@ ms do .
Now get out your han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ ef@@ s here .
You &apos;re going to see , in just two wee@@ ks , the normal wor@@ ms are old .
You can see the little head mo@@ ving down at the bot@@ to@@ m there .
But everything else is just l@@ ying there .
The animal &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly in the n@@ ur@@ sing home .
And if you look at the tis@@ su@@ es of the animal , they &apos;re star@@ ting to de@@ teri@@ or@@ ate .
You know , even if you &apos;ve never seen one of these little C@@ . ele@@ g@@ ans — which probably most of you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen one — you can tell they &apos;re old — isn &apos;t that interesting ?
So there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of univer@@ sa@@ l .
And now here is the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
One gene is chan@@ ged out of 20@@ ,000 , and look at it .
It &apos;s the same age , but it &apos;s not in the n@@ ur@@ sing home ; it &apos;s going s@@ ki@@ ing .
This is what &apos;s really co@@ ol : it &apos;s aging more s@@ low@@ ly .
It takes this wor@@ m two days to age as much as the normal wor@@ m ages in one day .
And when I tell people about this , they ten@@ d to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year@@ -old person who loo@@ ks really good for being 90 or 80 .
But it &apos;s really more like this : let &apos;s say you &apos;re a 30 year@@ -old guy — or in your 3@@ 0@@ s — and you &apos;re a bac@@ hel@@ or and you &apos;re da@@ ting people .
And you me@@ et someone you really like , you get to know her .
And you &apos;re in a res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , and you say , &quot; &quot; Well how old are you ? &quot; &quot; She says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 60 . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s like . And you would never know .
You would never know , until she told you .
( Laughter ) Okay .
So what is the da@@ f-@@ 2 gene ?
Well as you know , genes , which are part of the DNA , they &apos;re in@@ struc@@ tions to make a prote@@ in that does something .
And the da@@ f-@@ 2 gene en@@ co@@ des a hor@@ m@@ one recep@@ tor .
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hor@@ m@@ one recep@@ tor in red pun@@ ching through the e@@ dge of the cell .
So part of it is like a base@@ b@@ all glo@@ ve .
Par@@ t of it &apos;s on the out@@ side , and it &apos;s ca@@ t@@ ching the hor@@ m@@ one as it comes by in green .
And the other part is on the inside where it sen@@ ds si@@ gn@@ als into the cell .
Okay , so what is the da@@ f-@@ 2 recep@@ tor telling the inside of the cell ?
I just told you that , if you make a mu@@ tation in the da@@ f-@@ 2 gene cell , that you get a recep@@ tor that doesn &apos;t work as well ; the animal lives lon@@ ger .
So that means that the normal func@@ tion of this hor@@ m@@ one recep@@ tor is to spe@@ ed up aging .
That &apos;s what that ar@@ row means .
It spe@@ e@@ ds up aging . It makes it go fas@@ ter .
So it &apos;s like the animal has the g@@ ri@@ m re@@ ap@@ er inside of it@@ self , spe@@ e@@ ding up aging .
So this is al@@ together really , really interesting .
It says that aging is sub@@ ject to control by the genes , and speci@@ fi@@ cally by hormon@@ es .
So what kind of hormon@@ es are these ?
There &apos;s l@@ ots of hormon@@ es . There &apos;s t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in .
You know about a lot of them .
These hormon@@ es are similar to hormon@@ es that we have in our bo@@ dies .
The da@@ f-@@ 2 hor@@ m@@ one recep@@ tor is very similar to the recep@@ tor for the hor@@ m@@ one in@@ su@@ li@@ n and I@@ G@@ F@@ -@@ 1 .
Now you &apos;ve all heard of at le@@ ast in@@ su@@ li@@ n .
In@@ su@@ li@@ n is a hor@@ m@@ one that pro@@ mot@@ es the u@@ p@@ take of nu@@ tri@@ ents into your tis@@ su@@ es after you eat a me@@ al .
And the hor@@ m@@ one I@@ G@@ F@@ -@@ 1 pro@@ mot@@ es gro@@ w@@ th .
So these func@@ tions were kno@@ wn for these hormon@@ es for a long time , but our stu@@ dies su@@ gg@@ es@@ ted that maybe they had a th@@ ird func@@ tion that no@@ body knew about — maybe they also af@@ fec@@ t aging .
And it &apos;s looking like that &apos;s the case .
So after we made our disco@@ ver@@ ies with little C@@ . ele@@ g@@ ans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started as@@ king , if we made the same da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ tation , the hor@@ m@@ one recep@@ tor mu@@ tation , in other animals , will they live lon@@ ger ?
And that is the case in fli@@ es .
If you change this hor@@ m@@ one path@@ way in fli@@ es , they live lon@@ ger .
And also in mi@@ ce — and mi@@ ce are ma@@ mm@@ als like us .
So it &apos;s an an@@ ci@@ ent path@@ way , because it must have ar@@ is@@ en a long time ago in evolu@@ tion such that it still works in all these animals .
And also , the common pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or also ga@@ ve ri@@ se to people .
So maybe it &apos;s working in people the same way .
And there are h@@ in@@ ts of this .
So for example , there was one study that was done in a population of A@@ sh@@ k@@ en@@ az@@ i J@@ e@@ ws in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
And just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
And what they found was that people who li@@ ved to 90 or 100 were more li@@ ke@@ ly to have da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ ta@@ tions — that is , chan@@ ges in the gene that en@@ co@@ des the recep@@ tor for I@@ G@@ F@@ -@@ 1 .
And these chan@@ ges made the gene not ac@@ t as well as the normal gene would have ac@@ ted .
It da@@ ma@@ ged the gene .
So those are h@@ in@@ ts su@@ gg@@ esting that human@@ s are s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to the effec@@ ts of the hormon@@ es for aging .
So the next question , of course , is : I@@ s there any effec@@ t on ag@@ e@@ -@@ rela@@ ted disease ?
As you age , you &apos;re much more li@@ ke@@ ly to get cancer , Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s disease , heart disease , all sor@@ ts of dise@@ ases .
It tur@@ ns out that these lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved mu@@ tan@@ ts are more resist@@ ant to all these dise@@ ases .
They har@@ d@@ ly get cancer , and when they do it &apos;s not as se@@ ver@@ e .
So it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting dise@@ ases of aging until their old ?
So it su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that , if we could have a ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic or a p@@ ill to take to re@@ pli@@ cate some of these effec@@ ts in human@@ s , maybe we would have a way of com@@ b@@ ating l@@ ots of different ag@@ e@@ -@@ rela@@ ted dise@@ ases all at on@@ ce .
So how can a hor@@ m@@ one ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely af@@ fec@@ t the rate of aging ?
How could that work ?
Well it tur@@ ns out that in the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ tan@@ ts , a whole lot of genes are s@@ w@@ it@@ ched on in the DNA that en@@ co@@ de prote@@ ins that protec@@ t the cells and the tis@@ su@@ es , and re@@ pa@@ ir da@@ ma@@ ge .
And the way that they &apos;re s@@ w@@ it@@ ched on is by a gene regu@@ la@@ tor prote@@ in called FOXO .
So in a da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant — you see that I have the X dra@@ wn here through the recep@@ tor .
The recep@@ tor isn &apos;t working as well .
Un@@ der those condi@@ tions , the FOXO prote@@ in in blue has g@@ one into the nuc@@ le@@ us — that little compar@@ t@@ ment there in the mi@@ d@@ dle of the cell — and it &apos;s si@@ tting down on a gene bin@@ ding to it .
You see one gene . There are l@@ ots of genes actually that bin@@ d on FOXO .
And it &apos;s just si@@ tting on one of them .
So FOXO tur@@ ns on a lot of genes .
And the genes it tur@@ ns on inclu@@ des anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant genes , genes I call car@@ r@@ ot@@ -@@ gi@@ ver genes , wh@@ ose prote@@ in produc@@ ts actually help other prote@@ ins to func@@ tion well — to f@@ old correc@@ tly and func@@ tion correc@@ tly .
And it can also es@@ cor@@ t them to the gar@@ b@@ age can@@ s of the cell and rec@@ y@@ cle them if they &apos;re da@@ ma@@ ged .
DNA re@@ pa@@ ir genes are more ac@@ tive in these animals .
And the im@@ mun@@ e system is more ac@@ tive .
And many of these different genes , we &apos;ve sho@@ wn , actually con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to the long li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
So it &apos;s really interesting .
These animals have within them the la@@ t@@ ent capaci@@ ty to live much lon@@ ger than they nor@@ m@@ ally do .
They have the ability to protec@@ t themselves from many kinds of da@@ ma@@ ge , which we think makes them live lon@@ ger .
So what about the normal wor@@ m ?
Well when the da@@ f-@@ 2 recep@@ tor is ac@@ tive , then it tri@@ gg@@ ers a seri@@ es of ev@@ ents that pre@@ v@@ ent FOXO from getting into the nuc@@ le@@ us where the DNA is .
So it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
That &apos;s how it works . That &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , until we have the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
But what good is this for the wor@@ m ?
Well we think that in@@ su@@ li@@ n and I@@ G@@ F@@ -@@ 1 hormon@@ es are hormon@@ es that are partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ac@@ tive under fav@@ or@@ able condi@@ tions — in the good times — when food is pl@@ enti@@ ful and there &apos;s not a lot of st@@ ress in the environment .
Then they pro@@ m@@ ote the u@@ p@@ take of nu@@ tri@@ ents .
You can st@@ ore the food , use it for energy , grow , et@@ c .
But what we think is that , under condi@@ tions of st@@ ress , the lev@@ els of these hormon@@ es dro@@ p — for example , having limi@@ ted food sup@@ p@@ ly .
And that , we think , is re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed by the animal as a dan@@ ger si@@ gn@@ al , a si@@ gn@@ al that things are not o@@ kay and that it should ro@@ ll out its protec@@ tive capaci@@ ty .
So it activ@@ ates FOXO , FOXO goes to the DNA , and that tri@@ gg@@ ers the expres@@ sion of these genes that impro@@ ves the ability of the cell to protec@@ t it@@ self and re@@ pa@@ ir it@@ self .
And that &apos;s why we think the animals live lon@@ ger .
So you can think of FOXO as being like a buil@@ ding super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent .
So maybe he &apos;s a little bit la@@ z@@ y , but he &apos;s there , he &apos;s taking care of the buil@@ ding .
But it &apos;s de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating .
And then su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , he lear@@ ns that there &apos;s going to be a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
So he doesn &apos;t actually do anything hi@@ m@@ self .
He gets on the tele@@ ph@@ one — just like FOXO gets on the DNA — and he cal@@ ls up the ro@@ of@@ er , the win@@ do@@ w person , the pa@@ in@@ ter , the flo@@ or person .
And they all come and they for@@ ti@@ f@@ y the house .
And then the h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e comes through , and the house is in much better condi@@ tion than it would nor@@ m@@ ally have been in .
And not only that , it can also just last lon@@ ger , even if there isn &apos;t a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
So that &apos;s the concep@@ t here for how we think this life ex@@ ten@@ sion ability exist@@ s .
Now the really co@@ ol thing about FOXO is that there are different for@@ ms of it .
We all have FOXO genes , but we don &apos;t all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene .
J@@ ust like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have bro@@ wn eyes .
And there are cer@@ tain for@@ ms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
And that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these star@@ s .
And each one of these star@@ s repres@@ ents a population where scienti@@ sts have asked , &quot; &quot; Okay , are there differ@@ ences in the ty@@ pe of FOXO genes a@@ mon@@ g people who live a really long time ? &quot; &quot; and there are .
We don &apos;t know the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of how this works , but we do know then that FOXO genes can impac@@ t the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of people .
And that means that , maybe if we tw@@ e@@ ak it a little bit , we can incre@@ ase the health and lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty of people .
So this is really exci@@ ting to me .
A FOXO is a prote@@ in that we found in these little , ro@@ und wor@@ ms to af@@ fec@@ t li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , and here it af@@ fec@@ ts li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an in people .
So we &apos;ve been trying in our lab now to develo@@ p drugs that will activ@@ ate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will de@@ la@@ y aging and ag@@ e@@ -@@ rela@@ ted dise@@ ases .
And I &apos;m really op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic that this is going to work .
There are l@@ ots of different prote@@ ins that are kno@@ wn to af@@ fec@@ t aging .
And for at le@@ ast one of them , there is a drug .
There &apos;s one called T@@ O@@ R , which is another nu@@ tri@@ ent sen@@ s@@ or , like the in@@ su@@ li@@ n path@@ way .
And mu@@ ta@@ tions that da@@ ma@@ ge the T@@ O@@ R gene — just like the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ ta@@ tions — ex@@ ten@@ d li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an in wor@@ ms and fli@@ es and mi@@ ce .
But in this case , there &apos;s already a drug called rapa@@ my@@ ci@@ n that bin@@ ds to the T@@ O@@ R prote@@ in and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its its activi@@ ty .
And you can take rapa@@ my@@ ci@@ n and give it to a m@@ ouse — even when it &apos;s pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a m@@ ouse — if you give the m@@ ouse rapa@@ my@@ ci@@ n , it will live lon@@ ger .
Now I don &apos;t want you all to go out taking rapa@@ my@@ ci@@ n .
It is a drug for people , but the reason is it sup@@ pres@@ ses the im@@ mun@@ e system .
So people take it to pre@@ v@@ ent org@@ an trans@@ plan@@ ts from being re@@ jec@@ ted .
So this may not be the perfec@@ t drug for sta@@ ying young lon@@ ger .
But still , here in the year 20@@ 1@@ 1 , there &apos;s a drug that you can give to mi@@ ce at a pretty old age that will ex@@ ten@@ d their li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , which comes out of this science that &apos;s been done in all these different animals .
So I &apos;m really op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic , and I think it w@@ on &apos;t be too long , I hope , before this ag@@ e@@ -old dre@@ am beg@@ ins to come true .
Thank you .
( Applause ) M@@ at@@ t R@@ id@@ le@@ y : Thank you , C@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ ia .
Let me get this stra@@ ight .
Al@@ though you &apos;re looking for a drug that can sol@@ ve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were al@@ low@@ ed e@@ th@@ ic@@ ally , is start a human life from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot lon@@ ger ?
C@@ K : A@@ h , so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bin@@ d to the prote@@ in it@@ self and change its activi@@ ty .
So if you stop taking the drug , the prote@@ in would go back to normal .
You could change the genes in princi@@ ple .
There isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
And the reason is that these hormon@@ es , like the in@@ su@@ li@@ n and the I@@ G@@ F hormon@@ es and the T@@ O@@ R path@@ way , they &apos;re es@@ senti@@ al .
If you kno@@ ck them out comple@@ tely , then you &apos;re very si@@ ck .
So it might be that you would just have to fin@@ e tun@@ e it very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to get the ben@@ ef@@ its without getting any problems .
And I think that &apos;s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
And also , there are other ways of activ@@ ating FOXO that don &apos;t even invol@@ ve in@@ su@@ li@@ n or I@@ G@@ F@@ -@@ 1 that might even be sa@@ fer .
M@@ R : I was@@ n &apos;t su@@ gg@@ esting that I was going to go and do it , but ...
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on which you have wri@@ t@@ ten about and s@@ po@@ ken about , which is a ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble sen@@ escen@@ ce .
There are some cre@@ atur@@ es on this plan@@ et already that don &apos;t really do aging .
J@@ ust move to one side for us , if you would .
C@@ K : There are . There are some animals that don &apos;t see@@ m to age .
For example , there are some tor@@ to@@ is@@ es called B@@ lan@@ ding &apos;s tur@@ t@@ les .
And they grow to be about this size .
And they &apos;ve been ta@@ gg@@ ed , and they &apos;ve been found to be 70 years old .
And when you look at these 70 year@@ -old tur@@ t@@ les , you can &apos;t tell the differ@@ ence , just by looking , between those tur@@ t@@ les and 20 year@@ -old tur@@ t@@ les .
And the 70 year@@ -old ones , actually they &apos;re better at s@@ cou@@ ting out the good n@@ esting places , and they also have more pro@@ gen@@ y every year .
And there are other examp@@ les of these kinds of animals , like tur@@ ns , cer@@ tain kinds of bir@@ ds are like this .
And no@@ body kno@@ ws if they really can live fo@@ re@@ ver , or what ke@@ e@@ ps them from aging .
It &apos;s not c@@ lear .
If you look at bir@@ ds , which live a long time , cells from the bir@@ ds ten@@ d to be more resist@@ ant to a lot of different environ@@ mental st@@ res@@ ses like high tem@@ per@@ ature or hy@@ dro@@ gen per@@ o@@ xi@@ de , things like that .
And our lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved mu@@ tan@@ ts are too .
They &apos;re more resist@@ ant to these kinds of st@@ res@@ ses .
So it could be that the path@@ ways that I &apos;ve been talking about , which are set to r@@ un really qu@@ ick@@ ly in the wor@@ m , have a different normal set point in something like a bir@@ d , so that a bir@@ d can live a lot lon@@ ger .
And maybe they &apos;re even set really differ@@ ently in animals with no sen@@ escen@@ ce at all — but we don &apos;t know .
M@@ R : But what you &apos;re talking about here is not ex@@ ten@@ ding human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an by pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing death , so much as ex@@ ten@@ ding human y@@ ou@@ th@@ sp@@ an .
C@@ K : Y@@ es , that &apos;s right .
It &apos;s more like , say , if you were a do@@ g .
You no@@ tice that you &apos;re getting old , and you look at your human and you think , &quot; &quot; Why isn &apos;t this human getting old ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re not getting old in the do@@ g &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
It &apos;s more like that .
But now we &apos;re the human looking out and imag@@ in@@ ing a different human .
M@@ R : Thank you very much in@@ de@@ ed , C@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ ia K@@ en@@ y@@ on .
( Applause )
L@@ adi@@ es and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , ga@@ ther around .
I would love to share with you a story .
O@@ n@@ ce u@@ po@@ n a time in 19@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y G@@ er@@ many , there was the book .
Now dur@@ ing this time , the book was the king of stor@@ y@@ telling .
It was ven@@ er@@ able .
It was u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
But it was a little bit bor@@ ing .
Because in its 4@@ 00 years of exist@@ ence , stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ ers never e@@ vol@@ ved the book as a stor@@ y@@ telling devi@@ ce .
But then one au@@ th@@ or ar@@ ri@@ ved , and he chan@@ ged the game fo@@ re@@ ver .
( Music ) H@@ is name was Lo@@ th@@ ar , Lo@@ th@@ ar M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer .
Lo@@ th@@ ar M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer put his fo@@ o@@ t down , and he said , &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ u@@ g ist gen@@ u@@ g ! &quot; &quot; He gra@@ b@@ bed his p@@ en , he s@@ n@@ at@@ ched his sci@@ s@@ sor@@ s .
This man re@@ fu@@ sed to f@@ old to the conven@@ tions of nor@@ mal@@ cy and just decided to f@@ old .
H@@ ist@@ ory would know Lo@@ th@@ ar M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer as — who else ? — the world &apos;s first true inv@@ ent@@ or of the children &apos;s po@@ p@@ -@@ up book .
( Music ) For this de@@ light and for this won@@ der , people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
( C@@ he@@ er@@ ing ) They were happ@@ y because the story sur@@ vi@@ ved , and that the world would keep on sp@@ in@@ ning .
Lo@@ th@@ ar M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer was@@ n &apos;t the first to e@@ vol@@ ve the way a story was told , and he cer@@ tain@@ ly was@@ n &apos;t the last .
W@@ he@@ ther stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ ers realiz@@ ed it or not , they were chan@@ n@@ el@@ ing M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer &apos;s spi@@ ri@@ t when they mo@@ ved oper@@ a to v@@ au@@ d@@ vi@@ lle , radi@@ o news to radi@@ o the@@ ater , fil@@ m to fil@@ m in mo@@ tion to fil@@ m in sound , col@@ or , 3@@ D , on V@@ H@@ S and on D@@ V@@ D .
There see@@ med to be no cur@@ e for this M@@ e@@ g@@ gen@@ d@@ or@@ fer@@ i@@ ti@@ s .
And things got a lot more f@@ un when the Internet came around .
( Laughter ) Because , not only could people bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st their stories throu@@ gh@@ out the world , but they could do so using what see@@ med to be an in@@ fin@@ i@@ te amount of devi@@ ces .
For example , one comp@@ any would tell a story of love through its very own se@@ ar@@ ch eng@@ ine .
One Ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese produc@@ tion stu@@ dio would inter@@ pre@@ t Ameri@@ can poli@@ tics in 3@@ D .
( Laughter ) And one man would tell the stories of his fa@@ ther by using a pla@@ t@@ form called T@@ w@@ it@@ ter to communi@@ cate the ex@@ cre@@ ment his fa@@ ther would g@@ es@@ tic@@ u@@ late .
And after all this , everyone pa@@ used ; they took a ste@@ p back .
They realiz@@ ed that , in 6@@ ,000 years of stor@@ y@@ telling , they &apos;ve g@@ one from de@@ pic@@ ting hun@@ ting on ca@@ ve wal@@ ls to de@@ pic@@ ting S@@ ha@@ k@@ espe@@ are on F@@ ace@@ book wal@@ ls .
And this was a cause for ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tion .
The art of stor@@ y@@ telling has rema@@ in@@ ed un@@ chan@@ ged .
And for the most part , the stories are rec@@ y@@ c@@ led .
But the way that human@@ s tell the stories has always e@@ vol@@ ved with p@@ ure , consi@@ st@@ ent nov@@ el@@ ty .
And they re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed a man , one amazing G@@ er@@ man , every time a new stor@@ y@@ telling devi@@ ce po@@ p@@ ped up next .
And for that , the audi@@ ence — the lo@@ vely , beautiful audi@@ ence — would live hap@@ pi@@ ly ever after .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ er .
There wer@@ en &apos;t many of them a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble , and they wer@@ en &apos;t quite as e@@ as@@ y to find as the fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n bo@@ o@@ ks .
They sti@@ r@@ red my imag@@ in@@ ation . They op@@ en@@ ed up new wor@@ l@@ ds for me .
I come from a conven@@ tional , mi@@ d@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cla@@ ss N@@ ig@@ er@@ i@@ an family .
My fa@@ ther was a profes@@ s@@ or .
My mother s@@ ent y@@ a@@ ms and ri@@ ce , and our old clo@@ th@@ es , to his family .
So I fel@@ t enor@@ mous p@@ ity for F@@ i@@ de &apos;s family .
I was star@@ t@@ led .
It had not oc@@ cur@@ red to me that any@@ body in his family could actually make something .
All I had heard about them was how po@@ or they were , so that it had become im@@ possible for me to see them as anything else but po@@ or .
( Laughter ) She as@@ su@@ med that I did not know how to use a sto@@ ve .
But in the U.@@ S@@ . , wh@@ en@@ ever Africa came up , people tur@@ ned to me .
N@@ ever mind that I knew nothing about places like Na@@ mi@@ bi@@ a .
This single story of Africa ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely comes , I think , from W@@ est@@ er@@ n liter@@ ature .
Now , here is a quot@@ e from the wri@@ ting of a L@@ on@@ don mer@@ ch@@ ant called Jo@@ h@@ n L@@ ok , who sa@@ i@@ led to w@@ est Africa in 1@@ 5@@ 6@@ 1 and ke@@ pt a fas@@ cin@@ ating ac@@ coun@@ t of his vo@@ y@@ age .
In fact , I did not know what A@@ fri@@ can au@@ th@@ enti@@ city was .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore they were not au@@ th@@ en@@ tically A@@ fri@@ can .
But I must qu@@ ick@@ ly ad@@ d that I too am just as gu@@ il@@ ty in the question of the single story .
A few years ago , I visi@@ ted M@@ ex@@ ico from the U.@@ S@@ .
And , as of@@ ten happens in America , im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion became sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ mous with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans .
And then , I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with s@@ ha@@ me .
I told him that I had just read a no@@ vel called &quot; &quot; Ameri@@ can P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — and that it was such a s@@ ha@@ me that young Amer@@ ic@@ ans were seri@@ al m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Now , obvi@@ ously I said this in a f@@ it of mi@@ ld ir@@ ri@@ tation . ( Laughter )
This is not because I am a better person than that stud@@ ent , but because of America &apos;s cul@@ tural and econo@@ mic power , I had many stories of America .
I had read T@@ y@@ ler and U@@ p@@ di@@ ke and Ste@@ in@@ be@@ ck and G@@ a@@ it@@ sk@@ ill .
I did not have a single story of America .
But I also had gran@@ d@@ fa@@ thers who died in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp@@ s .
One of my clo@@ s@@ est fri@@ ends , O@@ k@@ o@@ lo@@ ma , died in a plan@@ e cra@@ sh because our fire tr@@ uc@@ ks did not have water .
I gre@@ w up under repres@@ sive mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y govern@@ ments that de@@ valu@@ ed education , so that sometimes , my parents were not pa@@ id their sal@@ ari@@ es .
I &apos;ve always fel@@ t that it is im@@ possible to eng@@ age pro@@ per@@ ly with a place or a person without eng@@ aging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
It emp@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ es how we are different ra@@ ther than how we are similar .
What if my mother had told us that F@@ i@@ de &apos;s family was po@@ or and har@@ d@@ working ?
Here was a woman , part of the ordin@@ ary mas@@ ses of N@@ ig@@ er@@ i@@ ans , who were not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be re@@ a@@ ders .
What if my roo@@ m@@ mate knew about con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary N@@ ig@@ er@@ i@@ an music , tal@@ en@@ ted people sing@@ ing in English and P@@ id@@ g@@ in , and I@@ g@@ bo and Y@@ or@@ u@@ ba and I@@ j@@ o , mi@@ x@@ ing inf@@ lu@@ ences from J@@ a@@ y@@ -@@ Z to F@@ ela to Bo@@ b Mar@@ le@@ y to their gran@@ d@@ fa@@ thers .
O@@ r about the mi@@ llions of other N@@ ig@@ er@@ i@@ ans who start bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses and sometimes fa@@ il , but continu@@ e to n@@ ur@@ se ambi@@ tion ?
M@@ any stories matter .
S@@ tori@@ es have been used to dis@@ pos@@ s@@ ess and to m@@ ali@@ g@@ n , but stories can also be used to em@@ power and to human@@ i@@ ze .
She in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed them to a book about the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n life that they had left be@@ hind .
H@@ i , kids .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m 7@@ 1 .
( Applause ) My h@@ us@@ b@@ and is 7@@ 6 .
My parents are in their late 9@@ 0@@ s , and O@@ li@@ vi@@ a , the do@@ g , is 1@@ 6 .
So let &apos;s talk about aging .
Let me tell you how I feel when I see my w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ les in the mir@@ ro@@ r and I realiz@@ e that some par@@ ts of me have dro@@ p@@ ped and I can &apos;t find them down there .
( Laughter ) Mar@@ y O@@ li@@ ver says in one of her poe@@ ms , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me , what is it that you pla@@ n to do with your one w@@ il@@ d and preci@@ ous life ? &quot; &quot; M@@ e , I inten@@ d to live pas@@ sion@@ ately .
When do we start aging ?
So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty deci@@ des when we are old , us@@ u@@ ally around 6@@ 5 , when we get M@@ edi@@ care , but we really start aging at bir@@ th .
We are aging right now , and we all experience it differ@@ ently .
We all feel youn@@ ger than our real age , because the spi@@ ri@@ t never ages .
I am still 1@@ 7 .
S@@ op@@ hi@@ a Lo@@ ren . L@@ oo@@ k at her .
She says that everything you see she o@@ w@@ es to s@@ pa@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i .
I tri@@ ed it and ga@@ in@@ ed 10 po@@ unds in the wrong places .
But at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , aging is also at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de and health .
But my real men@@ tor in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of aging is O@@ l@@ ga M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y .
This C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a gir@@ l at 60 started working in Ne@@ p@@ al to sa@@ ve young gir@@ ls from do@@ mes@@ tic bon@@ da@@ ge .
A@@ t 8@@ 8 , she has sa@@ ved 1@@ 2@@ ,000 gir@@ ls , and she has chan@@ ged the culture in the country .
( Applause ) Now it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al for fa@@ thers to se@@ ll their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters into ser@@ vi@@ tu@@ de .
She has also fo@@ un@@ ded or@@ ph@@ an@@ ages and nu@@ tri@@ tional c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s .
She is always happ@@ y and e@@ ter@@ n@@ ally young .
What have I lost in the last deca@@ des ?
People , of course , places , and the bo@@ und@@ less energy of my y@@ outh , and I &apos;m beg@@ in@@ ning to lo@@ se in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce , and that s@@ car@@ es me .
R@@ am D@@ as@@ s says that depen@@ den@@ cy h@@ ur@@ ts , but if you ac@@ cep@@ t it , there is less suf@@ fer@@ ing .
Af@@ ter a very bad st@@ ro@@ ke , his ag@@ el@@ ess s@@ ou@@ l wat@@ ches the chan@@ ges in the body with ten@@ der@@ ness , and he is gra@@ te@@ ful to the people who help him .
What have I ga@@ in@@ ed ?
F@@ ree@@ dom : I don &apos;t have to pro@@ ve anything any@@ more .
I &apos;m not st@@ uc@@ k in the idea of who I was , who I want to be , or what other people expec@@ t me to be .
I don &apos;t have to ple@@ ase men any@@ more , only animals .
I keep telling my super@@ e@@ go to back off and let me en@@ jo@@ y what I still have .
My body may be fal@@ ling a@@ part , but my brain is not , yet .
I love my brain .
I feel li@@ ghter .
I don &apos;t car@@ ry gru@@ d@@ ges , ambi@@ tion , van@@ ity , n@@ one of the de@@ ad@@ ly sin@@ s that are not even wor@@ th the t@@ rou@@ ble .
It &apos;s great to let go .
I should have started so@@ on@@ er .
And I also feel sof@@ ter because I &apos;m not s@@ car@@ ed of being vulner@@ able .
I don &apos;t see it as we@@ a@@ k@@ ness any@@ more .
And I &apos;ve ga@@ in@@ ed spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality .
I &apos;m aw@@ are that before , death was in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
Now , it &apos;s next do@@ or , or in my house .
I try to live min@@ d@@ ful@@ ly and be present in the moment .
B@@ y the way , the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ a@@ ma is someone who has ag@@ ed beauti@@ ful@@ ly , but who wan@@ ts to be ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an and ce@@ li@@ ba@@ te ?
( Laughter ) M@@ edi@@ tation hel@@ ps .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Ch@@ il@@ d : O@@ mm@@ m . O@@ mm@@ m . O@@ mm@@ m .
I@@ sa@@ bel A@@ ll@@ en@@ de : O@@ mm@@ m . O@@ mm@@ m . There it is .
And it &apos;s good to start early .
You know , for a va@@ in fe@@ mal@@ e like myself , it &apos;s very hard to age in this culture .
In@@ side , I feel good , I feel char@@ ming , se@@ duc@@ tive , sex@@ y .
No@@ body else se@@ es that . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m invi@@ sible .
I want to be the cen@@ ter of attention .
I ha@@ te to be invi@@ sible .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is Gra@@ ce D@@ am@@ man@@ n .
She has been in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir for six years after a terri@@ ble car ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
She says that there is nothing more sen@@ su@@ al than a ho@@ t sho@@ wer , that every dro@@ p of water is a b@@ l@@ es@@ sing to the sen@@ ses .
She doesn &apos;t see her@@ self as di@@ sab@@ led .
In her mind , she &apos;s still sur@@ f@@ ing in the ocean .
E@@ the@@ l Se@@ i@@ der@@ man , a fe@@ ist@@ y , be@@ lo@@ ved activi@@ st in the place where I live in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
She w@@ ear@@ s red pa@@ t@@ ent sho@@ es , and her man@@ tra is that one s@@ car@@ f is n@@ ice but two is better .
She has been a wi@@ do@@ w for n@@ ine years , but she &apos;s not looking for another mate .
She says that there is only a limi@@ ted number of ways you can s@@ cre@@ w — well , she says it in another way — and she has tri@@ ed them all .
( Laughter ) I , on the other hand , I still have er@@ o@@ tic fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es with An@@ ton@@ io B@@ an@@ der@@ as — ( Laughter ) — and my po@@ or h@@ us@@ b@@ and has to put up with it .
So how can I sta@@ y pas@@ sion@@ ate ?
I cannot will myself to be pas@@ sion@@ ate at 7@@ 1 .
I have been tra@@ in@@ ing for some time , and when I feel fl@@ at and bo@@ red , I fa@@ ke it .
A@@ t@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de .
How do I tra@@ in ? I tra@@ in by saying y@@ es to w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver comes my way : dra@@ ma , come@@ dy , tra@@ ge@@ dy , love , death , lo@@ s@@ ses .
Y@@ es to life .
And I tra@@ in by trying to sta@@ y in love .
It doesn &apos;t always work , but you cannot b@@ la@@ me me for trying .
And , on a final n@@ ote , re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment in S@@ pan@@ is@@ h is j@@ u@@ bi@@ lación .

Un@@ less you are ill or very po@@ or , you have cho@@ ic@@ es .

Well , I &apos;m invol@@ ved in other things , b@@ esi@@ des physi@@ cs .
In fact , most@@ ly now in other things .
One thing is dist@@ ant rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps a@@ mon@@ g human langu@@ ages .
And the profes@@ sion@@ al , histori@@ cal lingu@@ ist@@ s in the U.@@ S@@ .
and in W@@ est@@ er@@ n Europe most@@ ly try to sta@@ y away from any lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps , big g@@ rou@@ p@@ ings , g@@ rou@@ p@@ ings that go back a long time , lon@@ ger than the famili@@ ar famili@@ es .
They don &apos;t like that . They think it &apos;s c@@ ran@@ k . I don &apos;t think it &apos;s c@@ ran@@ k .
And there are some bri@@ lli@@ ant lingu@@ ist@@ s , most@@ ly R@@ us@@ si@@ ans , who are working on that , at S@@ an@@ ta F@@ e In@@ stitu@@ te and in Mo@@ s@@ co@@ w , and I would love to see where that le@@ ads .
D@@ o@@ es it really le@@ ad to a single an@@ c@@ est@@ or some 20 , 2@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ?
And what if we go back be@@ y@@ on@@ d that single an@@ c@@ est@@ or , when there was pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly a com@@ peti@@ tion a@@ mon@@ g many langu@@ ages ?
How far back does that go ? How far back does moder@@ n language go ?
How many ten@@ s of thousands of years does it go back ?
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : D@@ o you have a hun@@ ch or a hope for what the answer to that is ?
M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y G@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ Man@@ n : Well , I would gu@@ ess that moder@@ n language must be ol@@ der than the ca@@ ve pa@@ in@@ t@@ ings and ca@@ ve en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings and ca@@ ve s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures and d@@ ance ste@@ ps in the so@@ ft cla@@ y in the ca@@ ves in W@@ est@@ er@@ n Europe , in the Au@@ ri@@ g@@ na@@ ci@@ an Per@@ i@@ od some 3@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago , or ear@@ li@@ er .
I can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a moder@@ n language .
So , I would gu@@ ess that the actual ori@@ g@@ in goes back at le@@ ast that far and maybe f@@ ur@@ ther .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s at@@ t@@ es@@ ted langu@@ ages coul@@ dn &apos;t des@@ cen@@ d per@@ haps from one that &apos;s much youn@@ ger than that , like say 20@@ ,000 years , or something of that kind . It &apos;s what we call a bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ k .
C@@ A : Well , P@@ hi@@ li@@ p An@@ der@@ son may have been right .
You may just know more about everything than any@@ one .

In his in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral ad@@ d@@ ress , B@@ ar@@ ack O@@ ba@@ ma ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to each of us to give our best as we try to ex@@ tri@@ cate ourselves from this cur@@ r@@ ent finan@@ cial cri@@ sis .
But what did he ap@@ pe@@ al to ?
He did not , hap@@ pi@@ ly , fol@@ low in the fo@@ ot@@ ste@@ ps of his pre@@ de@@ ces@@ s@@ or , and tell us to just go sho@@ p@@ ping .
N@@ or did he tell us , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust us . T@@ r@@ ust your country .
In@@ v@@ est , inv@@ est , inv@@ est . &quot; &quot; In@@ stead , what he told us was to put a@@ side chil@@ dis@@ h things .
And he ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to vir@@ tu@@ e .
V@@ ir@@ tu@@ e is an ol@@ d-@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed word .
It see@@ ms a little out of place in a cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ e@@ dge environment like this one .
And b@@ esi@@ des , some of you might be wonder@@ ing , what the h@@ ell does it mean ?
Let me beg@@ in with an example .
This is the job descri@@ p@@ tion of a hospital j@@ an@@ it@@ or that is s@@ cro@@ lling up on the s@@ cre@@ en .
And all of the i@@ te@@ ms on it are un@@ re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
They &apos;re the things you would expec@@ t : mo@@ p the flo@@ ors , s@@ we@@ ep them , emp@@ ty the tra@@ sh , r@@ est@@ o@@ ck the ca@@ bin@@ e@@ ts .
It may be a little sur@@ pri@@ sing how many things there are , but it &apos;s not sur@@ pri@@ sing what they are .
But the one thing I want you to no@@ tice about them is this : even though this is a very long li@@ st , there isn &apos;t a single thing on it that invol@@ ves other human be@@ ings .
No@@ t one .
The j@@ an@@ it@@ or &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mor@@ tu@@ ary as in a hospital .
And yet , when some p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed hospital j@@ an@@ it@@ ors to get a sense of what they thought their j@@ ob@@ s were like , they en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed Mi@@ ke , who told them about how he st@@ op@@ ped mo@@ p@@ ping the flo@@ or because M@@ r. J@@ ones was out of his bed getting a little exer@@ ci@@ se , trying to build up his str@@ eng@@ th , wal@@ king s@@ low@@ ly up and down the h@@ all .
And Ch@@ ar@@ len@@ e told them about how she ig@@ no@@ red her super@@ vis@@ or &apos;s ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion and didn &apos;t vac@@ u@@ um the visi@@ tor &apos;s lo@@ un@@ ge because there were some family me@@ mb@@ ers who were there all day , every day who , at this moment , happened to be taking a na@@ p .
And then there was L@@ u@@ ke , who was@@ h@@ ed the flo@@ or in a co@@ ma@@ to@@ se young man &apos;s room tw@@ ice because the man &apos;s fa@@ ther , who had been ke@@ e@@ ping a vi@@ gi@@ l for six months , didn &apos;t see L@@ u@@ ke do it the first time , and his fa@@ ther was an@@ gr@@ y .
And behavi@@ or like this from j@@ an@@ it@@ ors , from tech@@ ni@@ ci@@ ans , from n@@ ur@@ ses and , if we &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y now and then , from doc@@ tors , doesn &apos;t just make people feel a little better , it actually impro@@ ves the qu@@ ality of pati@@ ent care and en@@ ab@@ les ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als to r@@ un well .
Now , not all j@@ an@@ it@@ ors are like this , of course .
But the ones who are think that these sor@@ ts of human interac@@ tions invol@@ ving kin@@ d@@ ness , care and em@@ path@@ y are an es@@ senti@@ al part of the job .
And yet their job descri@@ p@@ tion con@@ ta@@ ins not one word about other human be@@ ings .
These j@@ an@@ it@@ ors have the moral will to do right by other people .
And be@@ y@@ on@@ d this , they have the moral sk@@ ill to figur@@ e out what &quot; &quot; doing right &quot; &quot; means .
&quot; &quot; P@@ rac@@ tical wis@@ dom , &quot; &quot; A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le told us , &quot; is the com@@ bin@@ ation of moral will and moral sk@@ ill . &quot;
A wi@@ se person kno@@ ws when and how to make the ex@@ cep@@ tion to every ru@@ le , as the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors knew when to ig@@ nor@@ e the job du@@ ties in the ser@@ vi@@ ce of other ob@@ jec@@ tiv@@ es .
A wi@@ se person kno@@ ws how to impro@@ vi@@ se , as L@@ u@@ ke did when he re@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed the flo@@ or .
Re@@ al@@ -@@ world problems are of@@ ten ambi@@ gu@@ ous and ill@@ -@@ defin@@ ed and the con@@ text is always chan@@ ging .
A wi@@ se person is like a j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an — using the n@@ ot@@ es on the pa@@ ge , but dan@@ c@@ ing around them , inv@@ ent@@ ing com@@ bin@@ ations that are appro@@ pri@@ ate for the situ@@ ation and the people at hand .
A wi@@ se person kno@@ ws how to use these moral s@@ ki@@ lls in the ser@@ vi@@ ce of the right a@@ im@@ s .
To ser@@ ve other people , not to man@@ i@@ pu@@ late other people .
And finally , per@@ haps most important , a wi@@ se person is made , not bor@@ n .
W@@ is@@ dom depen@@ ds on experience , and not just any experience .
You need the time to get to know the people that you &apos;re ser@@ ving .
You need permi@@ s@@ sion to be al@@ low@@ ed to impro@@ vi@@ se , try new things , oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally to fa@@ il and to learn from your fa@@ il@@ ur@@ es .
And you need to be men@@ to@@ red by wi@@ se teachers .
When you ask the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors who beha@@ ved like the ones I descri@@ bed how hard it is to learn to do their job , they tell you that it takes l@@ ots of experience .
And they don &apos;t mean it takes l@@ ots of experience to learn how to mo@@ p flo@@ ors and emp@@ ty tra@@ sh can@@ s .
It takes l@@ ots of experience to learn how to care for people .
A@@ t TED , bri@@ lli@@ ance is ra@@ mp@@ ant .
It &apos;s s@@ car@@ y .
The good news is you don &apos;t need to be bri@@ lli@@ ant to be wi@@ se .
The bad news is that without wis@@ dom , bri@@ lli@@ ance isn &apos;t enough .
It &apos;s as li@@ ke@@ ly to get you and other people into t@@ rou@@ ble as anything else .
( Applause ) Now , I hope that we all know this .
There &apos;s a sense in which it &apos;s obvi@@ ous , and yet , let me tell you a little story .
It &apos;s a story about le@@ mon@@ ade .
A da@@ d and his se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -old son were wat@@ ching a De@@ tro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers game at the bal@@ l@@ par@@ k .
H@@ is son asked him for some le@@ mon@@ ade and D@@ ad went to the con@@ ces@@ sion st@@ and to bu@@ y it .
All they had was Mi@@ ke &apos;s H@@ ard Le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
D@@ ad , being an aca@@ de@@ mic , had no idea that Mi@@ ke &apos;s H@@ ard Le@@ mon@@ ade con@@ tain@@ ed al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
So he b@@ rou@@ ght it back .
And the kid was dr@@ in@@ king it , and a se@@ curi@@ ty gu@@ ard s@@ po@@ t@@ ted it , and called the poli@@ ce , who called an a@@ mb@@ ul@@ ance that r@@ us@@ h@@ ed to the bal@@ l@@ par@@ k , wh@@ is@@ ked the kid to the hospital .
The emer@@ gen@@ cy room as@@ cer@@ tain@@ ed that the kid had no al@@ co@@ ho@@ l in his blood .
And they were ready to let the kid go .
But not so f@@ ast .
The W@@ a@@ y@@ ne Co@@ un@@ ty Ch@@ il@@ d W@@ el@@ f@@ are Pro@@ tec@@ tion A@@ gen@@ cy said no .
And the child was s@@ ent to a fo@@ s@@ ter home for three days .
A@@ t that point , can the child go home ?
Well , a j@@ ud@@ ge said y@@ es , but only if the da@@ d lea@@ ves the house and ch@@ ec@@ ks into a mo@@ te@@ l .
Af@@ ter two wee@@ ks , I &apos;m happ@@ y to re@@ port , the family was re@@ uni@@ ted .
But the w@@ el@@ f@@ are wor@@ kers and the a@@ mb@@ ul@@ ance people and the j@@ ud@@ ge all said the same thing : &quot; We ha@@ te to do it but we have to fol@@ low pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ e . &quot;
How do things like this happen ?
S@@ co@@ t@@ t S@@ im@@ on , who told this story on N@@ P@@ R , said , &quot; &quot; R@@ ul@@ es and pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ es may be du@@ m@@ b , but they s@@ par@@ e you from thinking . &quot; &quot; And , to be fa@@ ir , r@@ ul@@ es are of@@ ten im@@ pos@@ ed because pre@@ vi@@ ous of@@ fici@@ als have been la@@ x and they let a child go back to an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old .
F@@ air enough .
When things go wrong , as of course they do , we re@@ ach for two to@@ ols to try to fi@@ x them .
One to@@ ol we re@@ ach for is r@@ ul@@ es .
Be@@ tter ones , more of them .
The second to@@ ol we re@@ ach for is incen@@ tiv@@ es .
Be@@ tter ones , more of them .
What else , after all , is there ?
We can cer@@ tain@@ ly see this in respon@@ se to the cur@@ r@@ ent finan@@ cial cri@@ sis .
Re@@ gu@@ late , regu@@ late , regu@@ late .
F@@ i@@ x the incen@@ tiv@@ es , fi@@ x the incen@@ tiv@@ es , fi@@ x the incen@@ tiv@@ es ...
The tru@@ th is that ne@@ i@@ ther r@@ ul@@ es n@@ or incen@@ tiv@@ es are enough to do the job .
How could you even wri@@ te a ru@@ le that got the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors to do what they did ?
And would you pa@@ y them a bon@@ us for being em@@ path@@ ic ?
It &apos;s pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous on its face .
And what happens is that as we turn incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly to r@@ ul@@ es , r@@ ul@@ es and incen@@ tiv@@ es may make things better in the sh@@ or@@ t r@@ un , but they create a do@@ w@@ n@@ ward spi@@ ral that makes them wor@@ se in the long r@@ un .
M@@ or@@ al sk@@ ill is chi@@ p@@ ped away by an over@@ -@@ reli@@ ance on r@@ ul@@ es that de@@ pri@@ ves us of the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to impro@@ vi@@ se and learn from our impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tions .
And moral will is under@@ min@@ ed by an inc@@ es@@ s@@ ant ap@@ pe@@ al to incen@@ tiv@@ es that dest@@ ro@@ y our des@@ i@@ re to do the right thing .
And without inten@@ ding it , by ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to r@@ ul@@ es and incen@@ tiv@@ es , we are eng@@ aging in a w@@ ar on wis@@ dom .
Let me just give you a few examp@@ les , first of r@@ ul@@ es and the w@@ ar on moral sk@@ ill .
The le@@ mon@@ ade story is one .
Se@@ con@@ d , no dou@@ b@@ t more famili@@ ar to you , is the n@@ ature of moder@@ n Ameri@@ can education : s@@ cri@@ p@@ ted , lo@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ ste@@ p cur@@ ri@@ cula .
Here &apos;s an example from C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
Re@@ ad@@ ing and en@@ jo@@ ying liter@@ ature and words that beg@@ in with &apos; B@@ . &apos; &quot; &quot; The B@@ ath : &quot; &quot; As@@ se@@ m@@ ble stud@@ ents on a ru@@ g and give stud@@ ents a war@@ ning about the dan@@ g@@ ers of ho@@ t water .
S@@ ay 7@@ 5 i@@ te@@ ms in this s@@ cri@@ pt to te@@ ach a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ pa@@ ge picture book .
All over C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go in every kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten cla@@ ss in the city , every teach@@ er is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .
We know why these s@@ cri@@ p@@ ts are there .
We don &apos;t tr@@ ust the j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment of teachers enough to let them loo@@ se on their own .
S@@ cri@@ p@@ ts like these are in@@ sur@@ ance poli@@ ci@@ es aga@@ in@@ st disa@@ s@@ ter .
And they pre@@ v@@ ent disa@@ s@@ ter .
But what they as@@ sure in its place is medi@@ o@@ cri@@ ty .
( Applause ) D@@ on &apos;t get me wrong . We need r@@ ul@@ es !
J@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans need some n@@ ot@@ es — most of them need some n@@ ot@@ es on the pa@@ ge .
We need more r@@ ul@@ es for the ban@@ kers , God kno@@ ws .
But too many r@@ ul@@ es pre@@ v@@ ent ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans from impro@@ vi@@ sing .
And as a resul@@ t , they lo@@ se their gi@@ f@@ ts , or wor@@ se , they stop pla@@ ying al@@ together .
Now , how about incen@@ tiv@@ es ?
They see@@ m c@@ le@@ ver@@ er .
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing , it see@@ ms only logical that two reas@@ ons are better than one and you &apos;re more li@@ ke@@ ly to do it .
R@@ ight ?
Well , not always .
So@@ me@@ times two reas@@ ons to do the same thing see@@ m to com@@ pe@@ te with one another instead of comp@@ li@@ men@@ ting , and they make people less li@@ ke@@ ly to do it .
I &apos;ll just give you one example because time is rac@@ ing .
In S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , back about 15 years ago , they were trying to deci@@ de where to si@@ te nuc@@ lear was@@ te du@@ mp@@ s .
There was going to be a national re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m .
So@@ me p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts went around and po@@ l@@ led ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens who were very well in@@ for@@ med .
And they said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you be wi@@ lling to have a nuc@@ lear was@@ te du@@ m@@ p in your commun@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; A@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly , 50 percent of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens said y@@ es .
They knew it was dan@@ ger@@ ous .
They thought it would redu@@ ce their pro@@ per@@ ty valu@@ es .
But it had to go some@@ where and they had respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ties as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
The p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts asked other people a sli@@ gh@@ tly different question .
They said , &quot; &quot; If we pa@@ id you six wee@@ ks &apos; sal@@ ary every year would you be wi@@ lling to have a nuc@@ lear was@@ te du@@ m@@ p in your commun@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons . It &apos;s my respon@@ si@@ bility and I &apos;m getting pa@@ id .
In@@ stead of 50 percent saying y@@ es , 25 percent said y@@ es .
What happens is that the second this in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion of incen@@ tive gets us so that instead of as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What is my respon@@ si@@ bility ? &quot; &quot; all we ask is , &quot; &quot; What ser@@ ves my inter@@ est@@ s ? &quot; &quot; When incen@@ tiv@@ es don &apos;t work , when C@@ E@@ Os ig@@ nor@@ e the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m health of their comp@@ ani@@ es in pur@@ su@@ it of sh@@ or@@ t@@ -@@ ter@@ m ga@@ ins that will le@@ ad to mas@@ sive bon@@ us@@ es , the respon@@ se is always the same .
G@@ et s@@ mar@@ ter incen@@ tiv@@ es .
The tru@@ th is that there are no incen@@ tiv@@ es that you can devi@@ se that are ever going to be s@@ mar@@ t enough .
An@@ y incen@@ tive system can be sub@@ ver@@ ted by bad will .
We need incen@@ tiv@@ es . People have to make a living .
But ex@@ ces@@ sive reli@@ ance on incen@@ tiv@@ es de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ es profes@@ sion@@ al activi@@ ty in two sen@@ ses of that word .
It caus@@ es people who eng@@ age in that activi@@ ty to lo@@ se mor@@ al@@ e and it caus@@ es the activi@@ ty it@@ self to lo@@ se mor@@ ality .
B@@ ar@@ ack O@@ ba@@ ma said , before he was in@@ au@@ gu@@ ra@@ ted , &quot; We must ask not just &apos; I@@ s it pro@@ fi@@ table ? &apos; but &apos; I@@ s it right ? &apos; &quot; And when profes@@ si@@ ons are de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ ed , everyone in them be@@ comes depen@@ d@@ ent on — ad@@ dic@@ ted to — incen@@ tiv@@ es and they stop as@@ king &quot; &quot; I@@ s it right ? &quot; &quot; We see this in medic@@ ine .
( &quot; &quot; Al@@ though it &apos;s nothing seri@@ ous , let &apos;s keep an ey@@ e on it to make sure it doesn &apos;t turn into a ma@@ j@@ or la@@ w@@ su@@ it . &quot; &quot; ) And we cer@@ tain@@ ly see it in the world of bus@@ in@@ ess .
( &quot; &quot; In order to rema@@ in com@@ peti@@ tive in today &apos;s mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id we &apos;re going to have to re@@ place you with a s@@ le@@ e@@ z@@ e@@ b@@ all . &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; I so@@ ld my s@@ ou@@ l for about a tent@@ h of what the da@@ m@@ n things are going for now . &quot; &quot; ) It is obvi@@ ous that this is not the way people want to do their work .
So what can we do ?
A few s@@ our@@ ces of hope : we ou@@ ght to try to re@@ -@@ mor@@ aliz@@ e work .
One way not to do it : te@@ ach more e@@ th@@ ic@@ s cour@@ ses .
( Applause ) There is no better way to show people that you &apos;re not seri@@ ous than to ti@@ e up everything you have to say about e@@ th@@ ic@@ s into a little p@@ ac@@ k@@ age with a bo@@ w and consi@@ g@@ n it to the mar@@ g@@ ins as an e@@ th@@ ic@@ s course .
What to do instead ?
One : C@@ ele@@ bra@@ te moral exemp@@ lars .
A@@ c@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge , when you go to la@@ w school , that a little vo@@ ice is wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing in your e@@ ar about A@@ t@@ tic@@ us Fin@@ ch .
No 10@@ -@@ year@@ -old goes to la@@ w school to do mer@@ g@@ ers and ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tions .
People are in@@ spi@@ red by moral her@@ o@@ es .
But we learn that with so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ cation comes the underst@@ an@@ ding that you can &apos;t ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge that you have moral her@@ o@@ es .
Well , ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge them .
B@@ e pro@@ u@@ d that you have them .
C@@ ele@@ bra@@ te them .
And de@@ m@@ and that the people who te@@ ach you ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge them and ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te them too .
That &apos;s one thing we can do .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember this : another moral h@@ ero , 15 years ago , A@@ aron F@@ e@@ u@@ er@@ ste@@ in , who was the head of M@@ al@@ den M@@ ill@@ s in M@@ as@@ sac@@ hu@@ se@@ t@@ ts — they made Pol@@ ar@@ te@@ c — The fac@@ t@@ ory bur@@ ned down .
3@@ ,000 emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es . He ke@@ pt every one of them on the pa@@ y@@ ro@@ ll .
Why ? Because it would have been a disa@@ s@@ ter for them and for the commun@@ ity if he had let them go .
&quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe on pa@@ per our comp@@ any is wor@@ th less to W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et , but I can tell you it &apos;s wor@@ th more . We &apos;re doing fin@@ e . &quot; &quot; J@@ ust at this TED we heard tal@@ ks from se@@ ver@@ al moral her@@ o@@ es .
T@@ w@@ o were partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing to me .
One was R@@ ay An@@ der@@ son , who tur@@ ned — ( Applause ) — tur@@ ned , you know , a part of the evi@@ l emp@@ i@@ re into a z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , or almost z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int bus@@ in@@ ess .
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do .
And a bon@@ us he &apos;s disco@@ ver@@ ing is he &apos;s actually going to make even more money .
H@@ is emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es are in@@ spi@@ red by the ef@@ for@@ t .
Why ? Because there happ@@ y to be doing something that &apos;s the right thing to do .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day we heard W@@ il@@ li@@ e S@@ mi@@ ts talk about re@@ -@@ for@@ esting in In@@ don@@ esi@@ a .
( Applause ) In many ways this is the perfec@@ t example .
Because it took the will to do the right thing .
God kno@@ ws it took a hu@@ ge amount of tech@@ ni@@ cal sk@@ ill .
I &apos;m bo@@ gg@@ led at how much he and his as@@ soci@@ ates nee@@ ded to know in order to p@@ lot this out .
But most important to make it work — and he emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zed this — is that it took kno@@ wing the people in the communi@@ ties .
Un@@ less the people you &apos;re working with are be@@ hind you , this will fa@@ il .
And there isn &apos;t a for@@ mul@@ a to tell you how to get the people be@@ hind you , because different people in different communi@@ ties organi@@ ze their lives in different ways .
So there &apos;s a lot here at TED , and at other places , to ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te .
And you don &apos;t have to be a me@@ ga@@ -@@ h@@ ero .
There are ordin@@ ary her@@ o@@ es .
O@@ r@@ din@@ ary her@@ o@@ es like the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors who are wor@@ th ce@@ le@@ bra@@ ting too .
As prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers each and every one of us should stri@@ ve to be ordin@@ ary , if not extraordin@@ ary her@@ o@@ es .
As he@@ ads of organi@@ z@@ ations , we should stri@@ ve to create environ@@ ments that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge and n@@ ur@@ ture both moral sk@@ ill and moral will .
E@@ ven the wis@@ est and most w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ me@@ an@@ ing people will give up if they have to s@@ wi@@ m aga@@ in@@ st the cur@@ r@@ ent in the organi@@ z@@ ations in which they work .
If you r@@ un an organi@@ z@@ ation , you should be sure that n@@ one of the j@@ ob@@ s — n@@ one of the j@@ ob@@ s — have job descri@@ p@@ tions like the job descri@@ p@@ tions of the j@@ an@@ it@@ ors .
Because the tru@@ th is that any work that you do that invol@@ ves interac@@ tion with other people is moral work .
And any moral work depen@@ ds u@@ po@@ n prac@@ tical wis@@ dom .
And , per@@ haps most important , as teachers , we should stri@@ ve to be the ordin@@ ary her@@ o@@ es , the moral exemp@@ lars , to the people we men@@ tor .
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers .
One is that we are always teach@@ ing .
So@@ me@@ one is always wat@@ ching .
The cam@@ era is always on .
B@@ ill G@@ ates tal@@ ked about the import@@ ance of education and , in particular , the mode@@ l that K@@ I@@ P@@ P was pro@@ vi@@ ding : &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge is power . &quot;
And he tal@@ ked about a lot of the wonderful things that K@@ I@@ P@@ P is doing to take in@@ ner@@ -@@ city kids and turn them in the direc@@ tion of colle@@ ge .
I want to fo@@ c@@ us on one particular thing K@@ I@@ P@@ P is doing that B@@ ill didn &apos;t men@@ tion .
That is that they have come to the realiz@@ ation that the single most important thing kids need to learn is char@@ ac@@ ter .
They need to learn to res@@ pec@@ t themselves .
They need to learn to res@@ pec@@ t their s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ma@@ tes .
They need to learn to res@@ pec@@ t their teachers .
And , most important , they need to learn to res@@ pec@@ t learning .
That &apos;s the princi@@ ple ob@@ jec@@ tive .
If you do that , the res@@ t is just pretty much a co@@ ast do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
And the teachers : the way you te@@ ach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other sta@@ ff em@@ body it every minu@@ te of every day .
O@@ ba@@ ma ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to vir@@ tu@@ e .
And I think he was right .
And the vir@@ tu@@ e I think we need ab@@ o@@ ve all others is prac@@ tical wis@@ dom , because it &apos;s what al@@ lo@@ ws other vir@@ tu@@ es — hon@@ est@@ y , kin@@ d@@ ness , cou@@ ra@@ ge and so on — to be dis@@ play@@ ed at the right time and in the right way .
He also ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to hope .
R@@ ight again .
I think there is reason for hope .
I think people want to be al@@ low@@ ed to be vir@@ tu@@ ous .
In many ways , it &apos;s what TED is all about .
W@@ an@@ ting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reas@@ ons .
This kind of wis@@ dom is within the gra@@ s@@ p of each and every one of us if only we start pa@@ ying attention .
P@@ a@@ ying attention to what we do , to how we do it , and , per@@ haps most import@@ an@@ tly , to the struc@@ ture of the organi@@ z@@ ations within which we work , so as to make sure that it en@@ ab@@ les us and other people to develo@@ p wis@@ dom ra@@ ther than having it sup@@ pres@@ sed .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You have to go and st@@ and out here a se@@ c .
B@@ ar@@ ry S@@ ch@@ war@@ t@@ z : Thank you very much .
( Applause )
All right , I want to see a show of han@@ ds : how many of you have un@@ fri@@ en@@ ded someone on F@@ ace@@ book because they said something of@@ fen@@ sive about poli@@ tics or reli@@ gi@@ on , chil@@ d@@ care , food ?
( Laughter ) And how many of you know at le@@ ast one person that you a@@ vo@@ id because you just don &apos;t want to talk to them ? ( Laughter )
You know , it used to be that in order to have a poli@@ te conversa@@ tion , we just had to fol@@ low the ad@@ vi@@ ce of H@@ en@@ ry H@@ ig@@ g@@ ins in &quot; &quot; My F@@ air L@@ ad@@ y &quot; &quot; : S@@ tic@@ k to the we@@ a@@ ther and your health .
But these days , with climate change and anti@@ -@@ va@@ x@@ x@@ ing , those sub@@ jects — ( Laughter ) are not sa@@ fe ei@@ ther .
So this world that we live in , this world in which every conversa@@ tion has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to de@@ vol@@ ve into an ar@@ gu@@ ment , where our poli@@ tici@@ ans can &apos;t spe@@ ak to one another and where even the most tri@@ vi@@ al of is@@ su@@ es have someone fi@@ gh@@ ting both pas@@ sion@@ ately for it and aga@@ in@@ st it , it &apos;s not normal .
Pe@@ w R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch did a study of 10@@ ,000 Ameri@@ can adul@@ ts , and they found that at this moment , we are more po@@ l@@ ari@@ zed , we are more divi@@ ded , than we ever have been in hist@@ ory .
We &apos;re less li@@ ke@@ ly to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , which means we &apos;re not listen@@ ing to each other .
And we make deci@@ si@@ ons about where to live , who to mar@@ ry and even who our fri@@ ends are going to be , based on what we already believe .
A@@ ga@@ in , that means we &apos;re not listen@@ ing to each other .
A conversa@@ tion re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a bal@@ ance between talking and listen@@ ing , and some@@ where al@@ ong the way , we lost that bal@@ ance .
Now , part of that is du@@ e to technology .
The s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones that you all ei@@ ther have in your han@@ ds or clo@@ se enough that you could gra@@ b them really qu@@ ick@@ ly .
A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to Pe@@ w R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch , about a th@@ ird of Ameri@@ can te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers sen@@ d more than a hundre@@ d tex@@ ts a day .
And many of them , almost most of them , are more li@@ ke@@ ly to text their fri@@ ends than they are to talk to them face to face .
There &apos;s this great piece in The A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic .
It was wri@@ t@@ ten by a high school teach@@ er na@@ med P@@ au@@ l B@@ ar@@ n@@ well .
And he ga@@ ve his kids a communi@@ cation project .
He wanted to te@@ ach them how to spe@@ ak on a speci@@ fic sub@@ ject without using n@@ ot@@ es .
And he said this : &quot; &quot; I came to realiz@@ e ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I came to realiz@@ e that conversa@@ tional com@@ pe@@ ten@@ ce might be the single most over@@ looked sk@@ ill we fa@@ il to te@@ ach .
K@@ i@@ ds s@@ pen@@ d h@@ our@@ s each day eng@@ aging with ideas and each other through s@@ cre@@ ens , but r@@ are@@ ly do they have an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to h@@ one their inter@@ person@@ al communi@@ ca@@ tions s@@ ki@@ lls .
It might sound like a fun@@ ny question , but we have to ask ourselves : I@@ s there any 2@@ 1@@ st@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y sk@@ ill more important than being able to s@@ us@@ tain co@@ her@@ ent , confi@@ d@@ ent conversa@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; Now , I make my living talking to people : No@@ bel Pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers , tr@@ uc@@ k dri@@ ver@@ s , bi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ ir@@ es , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teachers , he@@ ads of sta@@ te , p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ers .
I talk to people that I like . I talk to people that I don &apos;t like .
I talk to some people that I disa@@ gre@@ e with de@@ e@@ p@@ ly on a person@@ al level .
But I still have a great conversa@@ tion with them .
So I &apos;d like to s@@ pen@@ d the next 10 minu@@ tes or so teach@@ ing you how to talk and how to li@@ ste@@ n .
M@@ any of you have already heard a lot of ad@@ vi@@ ce on this , things like look the person in the ey@@ e , think of interesting to@@ pic@@ s to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s in ad@@ v@@ ance , look , no@@ d and s@@ mi@@ le to show that you &apos;re pa@@ ying attention , re@@ pe@@ at back what you just heard or su@@ mm@@ ari@@ ze it .
So I want you to for@@ get all of that .
It is cra@@ p .
( Laughter ) There is no reason to learn how to show you &apos;re pa@@ ying attention if you are in fact pa@@ ying attention . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Now , I actually use the exac@@ t same s@@ ki@@ lls as a profes@@ sion@@ al inter@@ vie@@ wer that I do in regu@@ lar life .
So , I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you how to inter@@ vie@@ w people , and that &apos;s actually going to help you learn how to be better conversa@@ tion@@ ali@@ sts .
L@@ ear@@ n to have a conversa@@ tion without wa@@ st@@ ing your time , without getting bo@@ red , and , ple@@ ase God , without of@@ fen@@ ding any@@ body .
We &apos;ve all had really great conversa@@ tions .
We &apos;ve had them before . We know what it &apos;s like .
The kind of conversa@@ tion where you wal@@ k away fe@@ el@@ ing eng@@ ag@@ ed and in@@ spi@@ red , or where you feel like you &apos;ve made a real connec@@ tion or you &apos;ve been perfec@@ tly underst@@ o@@ od .
There is no reason why most of your interac@@ tions can &apos;t be like that .
So I have 10 ba@@ sic r@@ ul@@ es . I &apos;m going to wal@@ k you through all of them , but hon@@ est@@ ly , if you just cho@@ ose one of them and mas@@ ter it , you &apos;ll already en@@ jo@@ y better conversa@@ tions .
N@@ u@@ mber one : D@@ on &apos;t multi@@ tas@@ k .
And I don &apos;t mean just set down your cell ph@@ one or your ta@@ b@@ let or your car ke@@ ys or w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver is in your hand .
I mean , be present .
B@@ e in that moment .
D@@ on &apos;t think about your ar@@ gu@@ ment you had with your bo@@ ss .
D@@ on &apos;t think about what you &apos;re going to have for din@@ ner .
If you want to get out of the conversa@@ tion , get out of the conversa@@ tion , but don &apos;t be half in it and half out of it .
N@@ u@@ mber two : D@@ on &apos;t pon@@ ti@@ fica@@ te .
If you want to sta@@ te your op@@ ini@@ on without any op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for respon@@ se or ar@@ gu@@ ment or p@@ us@@ h@@ back or gro@@ w@@ th , wri@@ te a blo@@ g .
( Laughter ) Now , there &apos;s a really good reason why I don &apos;t al@@ low pun@@ di@@ ts on my show : Because they &apos;re really bor@@ ing .
If they &apos;re con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive , they &apos;re going to ha@@ te O@@ ba@@ ma and food sta@@ mp@@ s and ab@@ or@@ tion .
If they &apos;re liber@@ al , they &apos;re going to ha@@ te big ban@@ ks and oil cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions and D@@ ick Ch@@ en@@ ey .
T@@ ot@@ ally pre@@ dic@@ table .
And you don &apos;t want to be like that .
You need to en@@ ter every conversa@@ tion as@@ su@@ ming that you have something to learn .
The fa@@ med ther@@ ap@@ ist M@@ . S@@ co@@ t@@ t P@@ ec@@ k said that true listen@@ ing re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a se@@ tting a@@ side of on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
And sometimes that means se@@ tting a@@ side your person@@ al op@@ ini@@ on .
He said that sen@@ sing this ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce , the spe@@ a@@ ker will become less and less vulner@@ able and more and more li@@ ke@@ ly to open up the in@@ ner rec@@ es@@ ses of his or her mind to the listen@@ er .
A@@ ga@@ in , as@@ su@@ me that you have something to learn .
B@@ ill N@@ y@@ e : &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ one you will ever me@@ et kno@@ ws something that you don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I put it this way : E@@ very@@ body is an ex@@ per@@ t in something .
N@@ u@@ mber three : U@@ se op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded ques@@ tions .
In this case , take a cu@@ e from j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts .
S@@ tar@@ t your ques@@ tions with who , what , when , where , why or how .
If you put in a comp@@ lica@@ ted question , you &apos;re going to get a simple answer out .
If I ask you , &quot; &quot; W@@ ere you terri@@ fi@@ ed ? &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to respon@@ d to the most power@@ ful word in that s@@ ent@@ ence , which is &quot; &quot; terri@@ fi@@ ed , &quot; &quot; and the answer is &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , I was &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; No , I was@@ n &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ere you an@@ gr@@ y ? &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , I was very an@@ gr@@ y . &quot;
Let them descri@@ be it . They &apos;re the ones that know .
T@@ ry as@@ king them things like , &quot; &quot; What was that like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; How did that feel ? &quot;
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it , and you &apos;re going to get a much more interesting respon@@ se .
N@@ u@@ mber four : G@@ o with the f@@ low .
That means thou@@ ghts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind .
We &apos;ve heard inter@@ vie@@ ws of@@ ten in which a gu@@ est is talking for se@@ ver@@ al minu@@ tes and then the ho@@ st comes back in and as@@ ks a question which see@@ ms like it comes out of no@@ where , or it &apos;s already been ans@@ wer@@ ed .
That means the ho@@ st probably st@@ op@@ ped listen@@ ing two minu@@ tes ago because he thought of this really c@@ le@@ ver question , and he was just bo@@ und and determin@@ ed to say that .
And we do the exac@@ t same thing .
We &apos;re si@@ tting there having a conversa@@ tion with someone , and then we remember that time that we me@@ t H@@ u@@ gh J@@ ac@@ k@@ man in a co@@ f@@ fe@@ e sho@@ p .
( Laughter ) And we stop listen@@ ing .
S@@ tori@@ es and ideas are going to come to you .
You need to let them come and let them go .
N@@ u@@ mber five : If you don &apos;t know , say that you don &apos;t know .
Now , people on the radi@@ o , especi@@ ally on N@@ P@@ R , are much more aw@@ are that they &apos;re going on the recor@@ d , and so they &apos;re more car@@ e@@ ful about what they cla@@ i@@ m to be an ex@@ per@@ t in and what they cla@@ i@@ m to know for sure .
D@@ o that . E@@ r@@ r on the side of ca@@ u@@ tion .
Tal@@ k should not be che@@ a@@ p .
N@@ u@@ mber six : D@@ on &apos;t equ@@ ate your experience with the@@ ir@@ s .
If they &apos;re talking about having lost a family member , don &apos;t start talking about the time you lost a family member .
If they &apos;re talking about the t@@ rou@@ ble they &apos;re having at work , don &apos;t tell them about how much you ha@@ te your job .
It &apos;s not the same . It is never the same .
All experi@@ ences are individu@@ al .
And , more import@@ an@@ tly , it is not about you .
You don &apos;t need to take that moment to pro@@ ve how amazing you are or how much you &apos;ve suf@@ fer@@ ed .
So@@ me@@ body asked Ste@@ ph@@ en Ha@@ w@@ king on@@ ce what his I@@ Q was , and he said , &quot; I have no idea . People who bra@@ g about their I@@ Q@@ s are lo@@ ser@@ s . &quot;
( Laughter ) Con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions are not a pro@@ mo@@ tional op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
N@@ u@@ mber se@@ ven : T@@ ry not to re@@ pe@@ at yourself .
It &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding , and it &apos;s really bor@@ ing , and we ten@@ d to do it a lot .
E@@ speci@@ ally in work conversa@@ tions or in conversa@@ tions with our kids , we have a point to make , so we just keep re@@ ph@@ ra@@ sing it over and over .
D@@ on &apos;t do that .
N@@ u@@ mber ei@@ ght : Sta@@ y out of the wee@@ ds .
Fran@@ k@@ ly , people don &apos;t care about the years , the na@@ mes , the da@@ tes , all those de@@ ta@@ il@@ s that you &apos;re stru@@ gg@@ ling to come up with in your mind .
They don &apos;t care . What they care about is you .
They care about what you &apos;re like , what you have in common .
So for@@ get the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s . Le@@ a@@ ve them out .
N@@ u@@ mber n@@ ine : This is not the last one , but it is the most important one .
L@@ is@@ ten .
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listen@@ ing is per@@ haps the most , the number one most important sk@@ ill that you could develo@@ p .
B@@ ud@@ d@@ ha said , and I &apos;m par@@ a@@ ph@@ ra@@ sing , &quot; If your m@@ outh is open , you &apos;re not learning . &quot;
And C@@ al@@ v@@ in Co@@ oli@@ dge said , &quot; &quot; No man ever listen@@ ed his way out of a job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why do we not li@@ ste@@ n to each other ?
N@@ u@@ mber one , we &apos;d ra@@ ther talk .
When I &apos;m talking , I &apos;m in control .
I don &apos;t have to he@@ ar anything I &apos;m not interes@@ ted in .
I &apos;m the cen@@ ter of attention .
I can bol@@ s@@ ter my own identi@@ ty .
But there &apos;s another reason : We get dist@@ rac@@ ted .
The a@@ ver@@ age person tal@@ ks at about 2@@ 25 word per minu@@ te , but we can li@@ ste@@ n at up to 5@@ 00 words per minu@@ te .
So our min@@ ds are fi@@ lling in those other 2@@ 7@@ 5 words .
And look , I know , it takes ef@@ for@@ t and energy to actually pa@@ y attention to someone , but if you can &apos;t do that , you &apos;re not in a conversa@@ tion .
You &apos;re just two people sh@@ ou@@ ting out bar@@ e@@ ly rela@@ ted s@@ enten@@ ces in the same place .
( Laughter ) You have to li@@ ste@@ n to one another .
Ste@@ ph@@ en Co@@ ve@@ y said it very beauti@@ ful@@ ly .
He said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ st of us don &apos;t li@@ ste@@ n with the in@@ t@@ ent to understand .
We li@@ ste@@ n with the in@@ t@@ ent to re@@ p@@ ly . &quot; &quot; One more ru@@ le , number 10 , and it &apos;s this one : B@@ e bri@@ e@@ f .
&#91; A good conversa@@ tion is like a min@@ is@@ k@@ ir@@ t ; sh@@ or@@ t enough to re@@ tain inter@@ est , but long enough to co@@ ver the sub@@ ject . — My S@@ is@@ ter &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) All of this bo@@ il@@ s down to the same ba@@ sic concep@@ t , and it is this one : B@@ e interes@@ ted in other people .
You know , I gre@@ w up with a very fa@@ mous gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther , and there was kind of a ri@@ tual in my home .
People would come over to talk to my gran@@ d@@ parents , and after they would lea@@ ve , my mother would come over to us , and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o you know who that was ?
She was the run@@ ner@@ -@@ up to M@@ is@@ s America .
He was the ma@@ y@@ or of S@@ ac@@ ra@@ mento .
She w@@ on a P@@ u@@ li@@ t@@ z@@ er Pri@@ ze . He &apos;s a R@@ us@@ si@@ an bal@@ let dan@@ cer . &quot; &quot; And I kind of gre@@ w up as@@ su@@ ming everyone has some hi@@ d@@ den , amazing thing about them .
And hon@@ est@@ ly , I think it &apos;s what makes me a better ho@@ st .
I keep my m@@ outh sh@@ ut as of@@ ten as I pos@@ si@@ bly can , I keep my mind open , and I &apos;m always pre@@ par@@ ed to be ama@@ zed , and I &apos;m never disa@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted .
You do the same thing .
G@@ o out , talk to people , li@@ ste@@ n to people , and , most import@@ an@@ tly , be pre@@ par@@ ed to be ama@@ zed .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
What are the mes@@ sa@@ ges we tell the wo@@ men that work with and for us ?
I left S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence .
The three of us take this cla@@ ss together .
W@@ o@@ men do not ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate for themselves in the wor@@ k@@ for@@ ce .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even as@@ king ? &quot; &quot; If you ask wo@@ men why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard .
Bo@@ y , it ma@@ t@@ ters a lot .
But it &apos;s not that simple .
And he ga@@ ve the case out , both of them , to two g@@ rou@@ ps of stud@@ ents .
But that one word made a really big differ@@ ence .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked Ho@@ ward .
This is the comp@@ li@@ cation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
That day chan@@ ged my c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal prac@@ tice and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely my car@@ e@@ er .
S@@ ix@@ ty@@ -@@ se@@ ven percent of the population had at le@@ ast one A@@ C@@ E , and 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 6 percent , one in ei@@ ght , had four or more A@@ C@@ E@@ s .
That &apos;s what we do .
Ma@@ ybe it &apos;s e@@ asi@@ er to see in other z@@ i@@ p co@@ des because we don &apos;t want to look at it .
I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cy@@ bor@@ gs , but not the cy@@ bor@@ gs that you think .
You &apos;re not R@@ o@@ bo@@ Co@@ p , and you &apos;re not T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or , but you &apos;re cy@@ bor@@ gs every time you look at a computer s@@ cre@@ en or use one of your cell ph@@ one devi@@ ces .
So what &apos;s a good defini@@ tion for cy@@ bor@@ g ?
Well , tradi@@ tional defini@@ tion is &quot; &quot; an org@@ an@@ ism to which ex@@ o@@ gen@@ ous com@@ pon@@ ents have been ad@@ ded for the pur@@ pos@@ e of ada@@ p@@ ting to new environ@@ ments . &quot; &quot; That came from a 19@@ 60 pa@@ per on space tra@@ vel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty aw@@ k@@ ward .
People ar@@ en &apos;t sup@@ pos@@ ed to be there .
But human@@ s are curi@@ ous , and they like to ad@@ d things to their bo@@ dies so they can go to the Al@@ ps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next .
So let &apos;s look at the concep@@ t of tradi@@ tional an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy .
So@@ me@@ body goes to another country , says , &quot; &quot; How fas@@ cin@@ ating these people are , how interesting their to@@ ols are , how curi@@ ous their culture is . &quot; &quot; And then they wri@@ te a pa@@ per , and maybe a few other an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts read it , and we think it &apos;s very ex@@ o@@ tic .
Well , what &apos;s happen@@ ing is that we &apos;ve su@@ d@@ den@@ ly found a new species .
I , as a cy@@ bor@@ g an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , have su@@ d@@ den@@ ly said , &quot; &quot; Oh , w@@ ow . Now su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we &apos;re a new form of Ho@@ mo sa@@ pi@@ ens , and look at these fas@@ cin@@ ating cul@@ tures , and look at these curi@@ ous ri@@ tu@@ als that every@@ body &apos;s doing around this technology .
They &apos;re cli@@ c@@ king on things and star@@ ing at s@@ cre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; Now there &apos;s a reason why I study this , ver@@ su@@ s tradi@@ tional an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy .
And the reason is that to@@ ol use , in the beg@@ in@@ ning — for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical mo@@ di@@ fi@@ cation of self .
It has hel@@ ped us to ex@@ ten@@ d our physical selves , go fas@@ ter , h@@ it things har@@ der , and there &apos;s been a limi@@ t on that .
But now what we &apos;re looking at is not an ex@@ ten@@ sion of the physical self , but an ex@@ ten@@ sion of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to tra@@ vel fas@@ ter , communi@@ cate differ@@ ently .
And the other thing that happens is that we &apos;re all car@@ r@@ ying around little Mar@@ y P@@ op@@ p@@ ins technology .
We can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get he@@ avi@@ er , and then we can take anything out .
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
Well , if you pr@@ int it out , it loo@@ ks like a thou@@ s@@ and po@@ unds of material that you &apos;re car@@ r@@ ying around all the time .
And if you actually lo@@ se that information , it means that you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly have this lo@@ ss in your mind , that you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly feel like something &apos;s mis@@ sing , ex@@ cep@@ t you ar@@ en &apos;t able to see it , so it fe@@ els like a very st@@ ran@@ ge emo@@ tion .
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
W@@ he@@ ther you like it or not , you &apos;re star@@ ting to show up on@@ line , and people are interac@@ ting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
And so you have to be car@@ e@@ ful about lea@@ ving your front la@@ wn open , which is basi@@ cally your F@@ ace@@ book w@@ all , so that people don &apos;t wri@@ te on it in the mi@@ d@@ dle of the ni@@ ght — because it &apos;s very much the equi@@ val@@ ent .
And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we have to start to ma@@ in@@ tain our second self .
You have to present yourself in di@@ gi@@ tal life in a similar way that you would in your anal@@ o@@ g life .
So , in the same way that you wa@@ ke up , take a sho@@ wer and get d@@ res@@ sed , you have to learn to do that for your di@@ gi@@ tal self .
And the problem is that a lot of people now , especi@@ ally adol@@ esc@@ ents , have to go through two adol@@ escen@@ ces .
They have to go through their pri@@ mar@@ y one , that &apos;s already aw@@ k@@ ward , and then they go through their second self &apos;s adol@@ escen@@ ce , and that &apos;s even more aw@@ k@@ ward because there &apos;s an actual hist@@ ory of what they &apos;ve g@@ one through on@@ line .
And any@@ body coming in new to technology is an adol@@ es@@ cent on@@ line right now , and so it &apos;s very aw@@ k@@ ward , and it &apos;s very dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t for them to do those things .
So when I was little , my da@@ d would si@@ t me down at ni@@ ght and he would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you about time and space in the future . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at . &quot; &quot; And he said one day , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sh@@ or@@ test dist@@ ance between two po@@ in@@ ts ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a stra@@ ight line . You told me that y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; I thought I was very c@@ le@@ ver .
He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . Here &apos;s a better way . &quot; &quot; He took a piece of pa@@ per , dre@@ w A and B on one side and the other and fol@@ ded them together so where A and B tou@@ ched .
And he said , &quot; &quot; That is the sh@@ or@@ test dist@@ ance between two po@@ in@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , da@@ d , da@@ d , how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you just b@@ end time and space , it takes an aw@@ ful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , o@@ kay . &quot; &quot; And so , when I went to s@@ le@@ ep for the next 10 or 20 years , I was thinking at ni@@ ght , &quot; &quot; I want to be the first person to create a wor@@ m@@ ho@@ le , to make things ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate fas@@ ter .
And I want to make a time mach@@ ine . &quot; &quot; I was always sen@@ ding mes@@ sa@@ ges to my future self using ta@@ pe recor@@ ders .
But then what I realiz@@ ed when I went to colle@@ ge is that technology doesn &apos;t just get ado@@ p@@ ted because it works .
It gets ado@@ p@@ ted because people use it and it &apos;s made for human@@ s .
So I started stud@@ ying an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy .
And when I was wri@@ ting my th@@ esis on cell ph@@ ones , I realiz@@ ed that everyone was car@@ r@@ ying around wor@@ m@@ h@@ ol@@ es in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
They wer@@ en &apos;t physi@@ cally trans@@ por@@ ting themselves ; they were ment@@ ally trans@@ por@@ ting themselves .
They would cli@@ ck on a bu@@ tt@@ on , and they would be connec@@ ted as A to B im@@ medi@@ ately .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , w@@ ow . I found it . This is great . &quot; &quot; So over time , time and space have com@@ pres@@ sed because of this .
You can st@@ and on one side of the world , wh@@ is@@ per something and be heard on the other .
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different ty@@ pe of time on every single devi@@ ce that you use .
E@@ very single bro@@ w@@ ser ta@@ b gi@@ ves you a different ty@@ pe of time .
And because of that , you start to di@@ g around for your ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al memor@@ ies — where did you lea@@ ve them ?
So now we &apos;re all these pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logi@@ sts that are di@@ gg@@ ing for things that we &apos;ve lost on our ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al bra@@ ins that we &apos;re car@@ r@@ ying around in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
And that inci@@ tes a sort of p@@ ani@@ c ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture — &quot; Oh no , where &apos;s this thing ? &quot;
We &apos;re all &quot; &quot; I Lo@@ ve L@@ uc@@ y &quot; &quot; on a great as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
And so what happens is , when we br@@ ing all that into the social space , we end up ch@@ ec@@ king our ph@@ ones all the time .
So we have this thing called ambi@@ ent in@@ ti@@ mac@@ y .
It &apos;s not that we &apos;re always connec@@ ted to every@@ body , but at any@@ time we can connec@@ t to any@@ one we want .
And if you were able to pr@@ int out every@@ body in your cell ph@@ one , the room would be very cro@@ w@@ ded .
These are the people that you have ac@@ cess to right now , in gener@@ al — all of these people , all of your fri@@ ends and family that you can connec@@ t to .
And so there are some p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical effec@@ ts that happen with this .
One I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is that people ar@@ en &apos;t taking time for mental ref@@ lec@@ tion any@@ more , and that they ar@@ en &apos;t s@@ lo@@ wing down and st@@ op@@ ping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to com@@ pe@@ te for their attention on the si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ous time inter@@ fac@@ es , pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logy and p@@ ani@@ c ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture .
They &apos;re not just si@@ tting there .
And really , when you have no ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al in@@ put , that is a time when there is a cre@@ ation of self , when you can do lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m plan@@ ning , when you can try and figur@@ e out who you really are .
And then , on@@ ce you do that , you can figur@@ e out how to present your second self in a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate way , instead of just de@@ al@@ ing with everything as it comes in — and oh , I have to do this , and I have to do this , and I have to do this .
And so this is very important .
I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed that , especi@@ ally kids today , they &apos;re not going to be de@@ al@@ ing with this do@@ w@@ n@@ -@@ time , that they have an in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ous bu@@ tt@@ on-@@ cli@@ c@@ king culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very exci@@ ted about it and very ad@@ dic@@ ted to it .
So if you think about it , the world ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t st@@ op@@ ped ei@@ ther .
It has its own ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic devi@@ ces , and these devi@@ ces are hel@@ ping us all to communi@@ cate and interac@@ t with each other .
But when you actually visu@@ aliz@@ e it , all the connec@@ tions that we &apos;re doing right now — this is an ima@@ ge of the ma@@ p@@ ping of the Internet — it doesn &apos;t look technolo@@ gi@@ cal .
It actually loo@@ ks very organi@@ c .
This is the first time in the entire hist@@ ory of human@@ ity that we &apos;ve connec@@ ted in this way .
And it &apos;s not that mach@@ in@@ es are taking over .
It &apos;s that they &apos;re hel@@ ping us to be more human , hel@@ ping us to connec@@ t with each other .
The most suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful technology gets out of the way and hel@@ ps us live our lives .
And really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we &apos;re co@@ -@@ cre@@ ating each other all the time .
And so this is the important point that I like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connec@@ tion — it &apos;s just done in a different way .
We &apos;re just incre@@ as@@ ing our human@@ ness and our ability to connec@@ t with each other , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y .
So that &apos;s why I study cy@@ bor@@ g an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Why grow ho@@ mes ? Because we can .
R@@ ight now , America is in an un@@ re@@ mi@@ tting sta@@ te of tra@@ u@@ ma .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
We &apos;ve got M@@ c@@ People , M@@ c@@ Car@@ s , M@@ c@@ H@@ ou@@ ses .
As an ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ t , I have to con@@ front something like this .
So what &apos;s a technology that will al@@ low us to make g@@ in@@ or@@ mous h@@ ou@@ ses ?
Well , it &apos;s been around for 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years .
It &apos;s called ple@@ ach@@ ing , or gra@@ f@@ ting tre@@ es together , or gra@@ f@@ ting in@@ os@@ cu@@ late matter into one con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous , vas@@ cular system .
And we do something different than what we did in the pa@@ st ; we ad@@ d kind of a mo@@ di@@ cu@@ m of inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce to that .
We use C@@ N@@ C to make s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding to tra@@ in se@@ mi@@ -@@ e@@ pi@@ the@@ tic matter , plan@@ ts , into a speci@@ fic ge@@ o@@ me@@ try that makes a home that we call a F@@ a@@ b T@@ ree Ha@@ b .
It f@@ its into the environment . It is the environment .
It is the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe , right ?
And you can have a hundre@@ d million of these ho@@ mes , and it &apos;s great because they su@@ ck car@@ b@@ on .
They &apos;re perfec@@ t .
You can have 100 million famili@@ es , or take things out of the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s , because these are ho@@ mes that are a part of the environment .
Ima@@ g@@ ine pre@@ -@@ gro@@ wing a vi@@ l@@ la@@ ge — it takes about se@@ ven to 10 years — and everything is green .
So not only do we do the ve@@ g@@ gi@@ e house , we also do the in@@ -@@ vi@@ tro me@@ at hab@@ it@@ at , or ho@@ mes that we &apos;re doing research on now in B@@ roo@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , where , as an ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture of@@ fi@@ ce , we &apos;re for the first of its kind to put in a mole@@ cular cell bio@@ logy lab and start experi@@ men@@ ting with re@@ gener@@ a@@ tive medic@@ ine and tis@@ su@@ e eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing and start thinking about what the future would be if ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture and bio@@ logy became one .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for a cou@@ ple of years , and that &apos;s our lab .
And what we do is we grow extra@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar ma@@ tri@@ x from pi@@ gs .
We use a mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed in@@ k@@ j@@ et pr@@ in@@ ter , and we pr@@ int ge@@ o@@ me@@ try .
We pr@@ int ge@@ o@@ me@@ try where we can make industri@@ al desig@@ n ob@@ jects like , you know , sho@@ es , lea@@ ther be@@ l@@ ts , han@@ d@@ b@@ ag@@ s , et@@ c . , where no senti@@ ent cre@@ ature is har@@ med .
It &apos;s vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m@@ less . It &apos;s me@@ at from a test tu@@ be .
So our the@@ ory is that ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally we should be doing this with ho@@ mes .
So here is a ty@@ pi@@ cal stu@@ d w@@ all , an ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ tural con@@ struc@@ tion , and this is a sec@@ tion of our pro@@ pos@@ al for a me@@ at house , where you can see we use f@@ at@@ ty cells as in@@ su@@ lation , ci@@ li@@ a for de@@ al@@ ing with w@@ ind lo@@ ads and s@@ ph@@ inc@@ ter m@@ us@@ c@@ les for the do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And we know it &apos;s incre@@ di@@ bly u@@ g@@ ly .
It could have been an English T@@ ud@@ or or S@@ pan@@ is@@ h C@@ ol@@ on@@ ial , but we kind of ch@@ ose this s@@ hap@@ e .
And there it is kind of gro@@ wn , at le@@ ast one particular sec@@ tion of it .
We had a big show in P@@ ra@@ gue , and we decided to put it in front of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral so reli@@ gi@@ on can con@@ front the house of me@@ at .
That &apos;s why we grow ho@@ mes . Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
You all know the tru@@ th of what I &apos;m going to say .
What &apos;s chan@@ ged is we now can look at the evi@@ den@@ ce , we can compar@@ e socie@@ ties , more and less equ@@ al socie@@ ties , and see what in@@ equ@@ ality does .
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then ex@@ pla@@ in why the lin@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you exis@@ t .
But first , see what a mi@@ ser@@ able lot we are .
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ ado@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expec@@ tan@@ cy aga@@ in@@ st gro@@ ss national in@@ come — how ri@@ ch countries are on a@@ ver@@ age .
And you see the countries on the right , like Nor@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as ri@@ ch as Isra@@ el , Gre@@ ece , Por@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left .
And it makes no differ@@ ence to their life expec@@ tan@@ cy at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a rela@@ tion@@ ship there .
But if we look within our socie@@ ties , there are extraordin@@ ary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across socie@@ ty .
This , again , is life expec@@ tan@@ cy .
These are small are@@ as of En@@ g@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the po@@ or@@ est on the right , the ri@@ ch@@ est on the left .
A lot of differ@@ ence between the po@@ or and the res@@ t of us .
E@@ ven the people just be@@ low the top have less good health than the people at the top .
So in@@ come means something very important within our socie@@ ties , and nothing between them .
The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ ado@@ x is that , within our socie@@ ties , we &apos;re looking at rela@@ tive in@@ come or social posi@@ tion , social sta@@ tu@@ s — where we are in rela@@ tion to each other and the size of the ga@@ ps between us .
And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ den the differ@@ ences , or com@@ pres@@ s them , make the in@@ come differ@@ ences bi@@ gg@@ er or s@@ mal@@ ler ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank has — on the s@@ cal@@ e of in@@ come differ@@ ences in these ri@@ ch developed mar@@ ket democra@@ ci@@ es .
The meas@@ ure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much ri@@ ch@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ to@@ m 20 percent in each country .
And you see in the more equ@@ al countries on the left — J@@ ap@@ an , Fin@@ land , Nor@@ way , S@@ we@@ den — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as ri@@ ch as the bot@@ to@@ m 20 percent .
But on the more un@@ equ@@ al end — U.@@ K@@ . , Por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ a@@ po@@ re — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big .
O@@ n that meas@@ ure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equ@@ al as some of the other suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful mar@@ ket democra@@ ci@@ es .
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our socie@@ ties .
We put them all in one in@@ de@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ i@@ gh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
The more un@@ equ@@ al countries are doing wor@@ se on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an extraordin@@ ari@@ ly clo@@ se cor@@ rela@@ tion .
But if you look at that same in@@ de@@ x of health and social problems in rela@@ tion to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ ita , gro@@ ss national in@@ come , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rela@@ tion any@@ more .
We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been ch@@ oo@@ sing problems to su@@ it our ar@@ gu@@ ment and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red this evi@@ den@@ ce , so we also did a pa@@ per in the Bri@@ ti@@ sh M@@ edi@@ cal J@@ our@@ n@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F in@@ de@@ x of child w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being .
It has 40 different com@@ pon@@ ents put together by other people .
It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have bo@@ o@@ ks at home , what im@@ mun@@ i@@ z@@ ation ra@@ tes are like , whether there &apos;s bul@@ l@@ ying at school .
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rela@@ tion to that same meas@@ ure of in@@ equ@@ ality .
K@@ i@@ ds do wor@@ se in the more un@@ equ@@ al socie@@ ties .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ ly signifi@@ can@@ t rela@@ tion@@ ship .
But on@@ ce again , if you look at that meas@@ ure of child w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being , in rela@@ tion to national in@@ come per person , there &apos;s no rela@@ tion@@ ship , no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a rela@@ tion@@ ship .
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The a@@ ver@@ age w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being of our socie@@ ties is not depen@@ d@@ ent any lon@@ ger on national in@@ come and econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th .
That &apos;s very important in po@@ o@@ rer countries , but not in the ri@@ ch developed world .
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in rela@@ tion to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the separ@@ ate b@@ its of our in@@ de@@ x .
Here , for inst@@ ance , is tr@@ ust .
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tr@@ us@@ ted .
It comes from the W@@ or@@ ld V@@ al@@ u@@ es S@@ ur@@ ve@@ y .
You see , at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can tr@@ ust others .
But in the more equ@@ al socie@@ ties , it ri@@ ses to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent .
And if you look at meas@@ ur@@ es of invol@@ ve@@ ment in commun@@ ity life or social ca@@ pi@@ tal , very similar rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps clo@@ se@@ ly rela@@ ted to in@@ equ@@ ality .
I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice .
We did it first on these ri@@ ch , developed countries , and then as a separ@@ ate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 Ameri@@ can sta@@ tes — as@@ king just the same question : do the more un@@ equ@@ al sta@@ tes do wor@@ se on all these kinds of meas@@ ur@@ es ?
So here is tr@@ ust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ ve@@ y of the fe@@ der@@ al government rela@@ ted to in@@ equ@@ ality .
V@@ er@@ y similar s@@ ca@@ tter over a similar ran@@ ge of lev@@ els of tr@@ ust .
Sa@@ me thing is going on .
B@@ asi@@ cally we found that almost anything that &apos;s rela@@ ted to tr@@ ust inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally is rela@@ ted to tr@@ ust a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the 50 sta@@ tes in that separ@@ ate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a f@@ lu@@ ke .
This is mental ill@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together figur@@ es using the same diagno@@ stic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sa@@ mp@@ les of the population to al@@ low us to compar@@ e ra@@ tes of mental ill@@ ness in each socie@@ ty .
This is the percent of the population with any mental ill@@ ness in the pre@@ ce@@ ding year .
And it goes from about ei@@ ght percent up to three times that — whole socie@@ ties with three times the level of mental ill@@ ness of others .
And again , clo@@ se@@ ly rela@@ ted to in@@ equ@@ ality .
This is viol@@ ence .
These red d@@ ots are Ameri@@ can sta@@ tes , and the blue tri@@ an@@ g@@ les are Can@@ adi@@ an pro@@ vin@@ ces .
But look at the s@@ cal@@ e of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 ho@@ mi@@ ci@@ des per million up to 1@@ 50 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son .
There &apos;s a about a ten@@ f@@ old differ@@ ence there , lo@@ g s@@ cal@@ e up the side .
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pri@@ son .
That rela@@ tion@@ ship is not ma@@ in@@ ly dri@@ ven by more cri@@ me .
In some places , that &apos;s part of it .
Here we have children dro@@ p@@ ping out of high school .
Ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly da@@ ma@@ ging , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population .
This is social mo@@ bility .
It &apos;s actually a meas@@ ure of mo@@ bility based on in@@ come .
B@@ asi@@ cally , it &apos;s as@@ king : do ri@@ ch fa@@ thers have ri@@ ch s@@ ons and po@@ or fa@@ thers have po@@ or s@@ ons , or is there no rela@@ tion@@ ship between the two ?
And at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , fa@@ thers &apos; in@@ come is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A .
And in S@@ can@@ din@@ avi@@ an countries , fa@@ thers &apos; in@@ come is much less important .
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ic@@ s here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that ten@@ d to be more common at the bot@@ to@@ m of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
But there are en@@ d@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are wor@@ se in more un@@ equ@@ al countries — not just a little bit wor@@ se , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common .
Th@@ in@@ k of the ex@@ pen@@ se , the human co@@ st of that .
I want to go back though to this gra@@ p@@ h that I sho@@ w@@ ed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two po@@ in@@ ts .
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ func@@ tion rela@@ ted to in@@ equ@@ ality .
It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things .
The other really important point I want to make on this gra@@ p@@ h is that , if you look at the bot@@ to@@ m , S@@ we@@ den and J@@ ap@@ an , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways .
The posi@@ tion of wo@@ men , how clo@@ se@@ ly they keep to the nuc@@ lear family , are on op@@ posi@@ te ends of the po@@ les in ter@@ ms of the ri@@ ch developed world .
But another really important differ@@ ence is how they get their gre@@ ater equ@@ ality .
S@@ we@@ den has hu@@ ge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it n@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al w@@ el@@ f@@ are sta@@ te , gener@@ ous ben@@ ef@@ its and so on .
J@@ ap@@ an is ra@@ ther different though .
It star@@ ts off with much s@@ mal@@ ler differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lo@@ wer ta@@ xes .
It has a s@@ mal@@ ler w@@ el@@ f@@ are sta@@ te .
And in our anal@@ y@@ sis of the Ameri@@ can sta@@ tes , we find ra@@ ther the same contra@@ st .
There are some sta@@ tes that do well through re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , some sta@@ tes that do well because they have s@@ mal@@ ler in@@ come differ@@ ences before ta@@ x .
I am not talking about perfec@@ t equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what exist@@ s in ri@@ ch developed mar@@ ket democra@@ ci@@ es .
But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social cla@@ ss , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions .
It goes through to@@ war@@ ds the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions in the mi@@ d@@ dle , then the j@@ uni@@ or n@@ on-@@ man@@ u@@ al , going up high to the profes@@ sion@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of lar@@ ger comp@@ ani@@ es .
You see there that S@@ we@@ den does better than Bri@@ tain all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ social effec@@ ts of in@@ equ@@ ality .
And of course , those fe@@ el@@ ings of the sta@@ tu@@ s com@@ peti@@ tion that comes out of that dri@@ ves the consu@@ mer@@ ism in our socie@@ ty .
It also le@@ ads to sta@@ tu@@ s in@@ se@@ curi@@ ty .
We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ ud@@ ged and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ gar@@ ded as at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive , c@@ le@@ ver , all that kind of thing .
The soci@@ al@@ -@@ e@@ valu@@ a@@ tive j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments incre@@ ase , the fe@@ ar of those soci@@ al@@ -@@ e@@ valu@@ a@@ tive j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments .
And the con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion was it was tas@@ ks that inclu@@ ded soci@@ al@@ -@@ e@@ valu@@ a@@ tive th@@ re@@ at — th@@ re@@ at@@ s to sel@@ f-@@ este@@ e@@ m or social sta@@ tu@@ s in which others can ne@@ ga@@ tively j@@ ud@@ ge your per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of st@@ res@@ ses have a very particular effec@@ t on the physi@@ o@@ logy of st@@ ress .
Now we have been cri@@ tici@@ zed .
O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very sur@@ pri@@ sing .
We have an absolu@@ te ru@@ le that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ sis .
Ou@@ r data s@@ our@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t .
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se that would in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 stu@@ dies of health in rela@@ tion to in@@ come and equ@@ ality in the aca@@ de@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed j@@ our@@ n@@ als .
This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion .
The same countries , the same meas@@ ure of in@@ equ@@ ality , one problem after another .
Why don &apos;t we control for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ ita doesn &apos;t make any differ@@ ence .
And of course , others using more so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted me@@ th@@ o@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on .
What about caus@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ rela@@ tion in it@@ self doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve caus@@ ality .
We s@@ pen@@ d a good bit of time .
And in@@ de@@ ed , people know the ca@@ usa@@ l lin@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes .
The big change in our underst@@ an@@ ding of dri@@ ver@@ s of ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ c health in the ri@@ ch developed world is how important ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ c st@@ ress from social s@@ our@@ ces is af@@ fec@@ ting the im@@ mun@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cular system .
O@@ r for inst@@ ance , the reason why viol@@ ence be@@ comes more common in more un@@ equ@@ al socie@@ ties is because people are sen@@ si@@ tive to being looked down on .
We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in in@@ come , the bon@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly we have a han@@ dle on the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ social w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being of whole socie@@ ties , and that &apos;s exci@@ ting .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I gre@@ w up in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ re@@ land , right up in the very , very nor@@ th end of it there , where it &apos;s absolu@@ tely f@@ ree@@ zing co@@ ld .
This was me run@@ ning around in the back gar@@ den mi@@ d-@@ su@@ mm@@ er .
( Laughter ) I coul@@ dn &apos;t pic@@ k a car@@ e@@ er .
In I@@ re@@ land the obvi@@ ous cho@@ ice is the mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y , but to be hon@@ est it actually kind of suc@@ ks .
( Laughter ) My mother wanted me to be a den@@ ti@@ st .
But the problem was that people ke@@ pt blo@@ wing everything up .
So I actually went to school in B@@ el@@ f@@ ast , which was where all the ac@@ tion happened .
And this was a pretty common si@@ ght .
The school I went to was pretty bor@@ ing .
They for@@ ced us to learn things like L@@ a@@ ti@@ n .
The school teachers wer@@ en &apos;t having much f@@ un , the s@@ por@@ ts were very di@@ r@@ ty or very pa@@ in@@ ful .
So I c@@ le@@ ver@@ ly ch@@ ose ro@@ wing , which I got very good at .
And I was actually ro@@ wing for my school here until this fa@@ te@@ ful day , and I fli@@ p@@ ped over right in front of the entire school .
And that was the fin@@ is@@ hing pos@@ t right there .
( Laughter ) So this was extre@@ me@@ ly e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ sing .
But our school at that time got a gr@@ ant from the government , and they got an incre@@ di@@ ble computer — the research mach@@ ine 3@@ D@@ Z — and they left the progra@@ mm@@ ing man@@ u@@ als l@@ ying around .
And so stud@@ ents like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to progra@@ m it .
Al@@ so around this time , at home , this was the computer that people were bu@@ ying .
It was called the S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir Z@@ X@@ 80 . This was a 1@@ K computer , and you &apos;d bu@@ y your progra@@ ms on ca@@ s@@ se@@ t@@ te ta@@ pe .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally I &apos;m just going to pa@@ use for one second , because I heard that there &apos;s a pr@@ er@@ equi@@ si@@ te to spe@@ ak here at TED — you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big ha@@ ir .
So I b@@ rou@@ ght a picture with big ha@@ ir .
( Laughter ) .
I just want to get that out of the way .
So after the S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir Z@@ X@@ 80 came al@@ ong the very c@@ le@@ ver@@ ly na@@ med S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir Z@@ X@@ 8@@ 1 .
( Laughter ) And — you see the picture at the bot@@ to@@ m ?
There &apos;s a picture of a guy doing ho@@ me@@ work with his son .
That &apos;s what they thought they had buil@@ t it for .
The re@@ ality is we got the progra@@ mm@@ ing man@@ u@@ al and we started making games for it .
We were progra@@ mm@@ ing in B@@ A@@ S@@ I@@ C , which is a pretty aw@@ ful language for games , so we en@@ ded up learning As@@ se@@ mb@@ ly language so we could really take control of the har@@ d@@ w@@ are .
This is the guy that in@@ ven@@ ted it , S@@ ir C@@ live S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir , and he &apos;s sho@@ wing his mach@@ ine .
You had this same thing in America , it was called the Ti@@ me@@ x S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir@@ 1@@ 000 .
To play a game in those days you had to have an imag@@ in@@ ation to believe that you were really pla@@ ying &quot; &quot; B@@ at@@ t@@ l@@ estar G@@ al@@ ac@@ tica . &quot; &quot; The gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s were just hor@@ ri@@ ble .
You had to have an even better imag@@ in@@ ation to play this game , &quot; De@@ ath R@@ i@@ der . &quot;
But of course the scienti@@ sts coul@@ dn &apos;t help themselves .
They started making their own video games .
This is one of my fav@@ ori@@ te ones here , where they have ra@@ b@@ bit bre@@ e@@ ding , so mal@@ es cho@@ ose the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ra@@ b@@ bit .
It was around this time we went from 1@@ K to 1@@ 6@@ K , which was quite the lea@@ p .
And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing how much 1@@ 6@@ K is , this e@@ B@@ ay logo here is 1@@ 6@@ K .
And in that amount of memor@@ y someone progra@@ m@@ med a full f@@ light si@@ mu@@ lation progra@@ m .
And that &apos;s what it looked like .
I sp@@ ent ages fl@@ ying this f@@ light si@@ mu@@ la@@ tor , and I hon@@ est@@ ly belie@@ ved I could f@@ ly a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es by the end of it .
Here &apos;s C@@ live S@@ inc@@ la@@ ir now la@@ un@@ ching his col@@ or computer .
He &apos;s recogni@@ zed as being the fa@@ ther of video games in Europe .
He &apos;s a multi@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ on@@ ai@@ re , and I think that &apos;s why he &apos;s s@@ mi@@ ling in this phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h .
So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
So@@ me of the high@@ li@@ ghts were things like &quot; &quot; The T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ la@@ d@@ di@@ n , &quot; the &quot; T@@ e@@ en@@ age Mu@@ t@@ ant H@@ ero Tur@@ t@@ les . &quot;
Because I was from the Uni@@ ted K@@ ing@@ dom , they thought the word n@@ in@@ j@@ a was a little too mean for children , so they decided to call it h@@ ero instead .
I person@@ ally pre@@ fer@@ red the S@@ pan@@ is@@ h ver@@ sion , which was &quot; &quot; T@@ or@@ tu@@ gas N@@ in@@ j@@ a . &quot; &quot; That was much better .
( Laughter ) Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game indu@@ stry and H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od to actually work together on something — instead of li@@ cen@@ sing from each other , to actually work .
Now , Ch@@ r@@ is did ask me to br@@ ing some sta@@ ti@@ stics with me , so I &apos;ve done that .
The video game indu@@ stry in 200@@ 5 became a 2@@ 9 billion dol@@ lar bus@@ in@@ ess .
It gro@@ ws every year .
L@@ ast year was the bi@@ gg@@ est year .
B@@ y 200@@ 8 , we &apos;re going to k@@ ick the bu@@ t@@ t of the music indu@@ stry .
B@@ y 20@@ 10 , we &apos;re going to h@@ it 4@@ 2 billion .
4@@ 3 percent of ga@@ m@@ ers are fe@@ mal@@ e .
So there &apos;s a lot more fe@@ mal@@ e ga@@ m@@ ers than people are really aw@@ are .
The a@@ ver@@ age age of ga@@ m@@ ers ?
Well , obvi@@ ously it &apos;s for children , right ?
Well , no , actually it &apos;s 30 years old .
And inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , the people who bu@@ y the most games are 3@@ 7 .
So 3@@ 7 is our tar@@ get audi@@ ence .
All video games are viol@@ ent .
O@@ f course the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s love to be@@ at on this .
But 8@@ 3 percent of games don &apos;t have any ma@@ ture cont@@ ent w@@ ha@@ t@@ so@@ ever , so it &apos;s just not true .
O@@ n@@ line ga@@ ming sta@@ ti@@ stics .
I b@@ rou@@ ght some stuff on &quot; &quot; W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s 5@@ .@@ 5 million play@@ ers .
It makes about 80 million b@@ uc@@ ks a mon@@ th in sub@@ s@@ cri@@ p@@ tions .
It co@@ sts 50 b@@ uc@@ ks just to inst@@ all it on your computer , making the publi@@ sh@@ er about another 2@@ 7@@ 5 million .
The game co@@ sts about 80 million dollars to make , so basi@@ cally it pa@@ ys for it@@ self in about a mon@@ th .
A play@@ er in a game called &quot; &quot; Pro@@ ject En@@ tro@@ pi@@ a &quot; &quot; actually b@@ ou@@ ght his own is@@ land for 2@@ 6@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 dollars .
You have to remember that this is not a real is@@ land .
He didn &apos;t actually bu@@ y anything , just some data .
But he got great ter@@ ms on it .
This pur@@ cha@@ se inclu@@ ded min@@ ing and hun@@ ting ri@@ ghts , o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship of all land on the is@@ land , and a ca@@ st@@ le with no f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure inclu@@ ded .
( Laughter ) This mar@@ ket is now esti@@ ma@@ ted at over 8@@ 00 million dollars an@@ nu@@ ally .
And what &apos;s interesting about it is the mar@@ ket was actually cre@@ ated by the ga@@ m@@ ers themselves .
They found c@@ le@@ ver ways to tra@@ de i@@ te@@ ms and to se@@ ll their ac@@ coun@@ ts to each other so that they could make money while they were pla@@ ying their games .
I do@@ ve on@@ to e@@ B@@ ay a cou@@ ple of days ago just to see what was g@@ ong on , ty@@ ped in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft , got 6@@ ,000 i@@ te@@ ms .
I li@@ ked this one the best : a level 60 W@@ ar@@ lo@@ ck with l@@ ots of e@@ pic@@ s for 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars .
It &apos;s like that guy obvi@@ ously had some pa@@ in while making it .
So as far as po@@ pul@@ ar@@ ity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
It tur@@ ns out they &apos;re actually in H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od Bo@@ w@@ l in L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles listen@@ ing to the L@@ .@@ A@@ . P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic pla@@ ying video game music .
That &apos;s what the show loo@@ ks like .
You would expec@@ t it to be che@@ es@@ y , but it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s very , very e@@ pi@@ c and a very beautiful con@@ cer@@ t .
And the people that went there absolu@@ tely lo@@ ved it .
What do you think these people are doing ?
They &apos;re actually br@@ ing@@ ing their compu@@ ters so they can play games aga@@ in@@ st each other .
And this is happen@@ ing in every city around the world .
This is happen@@ ing in your lo@@ cal ci@@ ties too , you &apos;re probably just not aw@@ are of it .
Now , Ch@@ r@@ is told me that you had a ti@@ me@@ line video a few years ago here just to show how video game gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s have been impro@@ ving .
I wanted to u@@ p@@ da@@ te that video and give you a new look at it .
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it .
We &apos;re on this cur@@ ve , and the gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s are getting so ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously better .
And I &apos;m going to show you up to maybe 200@@ 7 .
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now .
So we &apos;re going to start that video .
V@@ ide@@ o : Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out human hist@@ ory people have play@@ ed games .
As man &apos;s inte@@ l@@ lec@@ t and technology have e@@ vol@@ ved so too have the games he pla@@ ys .
( Music ) ( Applause ) David Per@@ ry : The thing again I want you to think about is , don &apos;t look at these gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s and think of that &apos;s the way it is .
Th@@ in@@ k about that &apos;s where we are right now , and the cur@@ ve that we &apos;re on means that this is going to continu@@ e to get better .
This is an example of the kind of gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s you need to be able to dra@@ w if you wanted to get a job in the video game indu@@ stry today .
You need to be really an incre@@ di@@ ble arti@@ st .
And on@@ ce we get enough of those gu@@ ys , we &apos;re going to want more fan@@ tas@@ y arti@@ sts that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or char@@ ac@@ ters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
So the obvi@@ ous thing for me to talk about today is gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s and audi@@ o .
But if you were to go to a game develo@@ per@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence , what they &apos;re all talking about is emo@@ tion , pur@@ pos@@ e , me@@ an@@ ing , underst@@ an@@ ding and fe@@ el@@ ing .
You &apos;ll he@@ ar about tal@@ ks like , can a video game make you cr@@ y ?
And these are the kind of to@@ pic@@ s we really actually care about .
I came across a stud@@ ent who &apos;s absolu@@ tely ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent at expres@@ sing hi@@ m@@ self , and this stud@@ ent ag@@ re@@ ed that he would not show his video to any@@ body until you here at TED had seen it .
So I &apos;d like to play this video .
So this is a stud@@ ent &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on on what his experience of games are .
V@@ ide@@ o : I , like many of you , live some@@ where between re@@ ality and video games .
So@@ me part of me — a true living , bre@@ a@@ thing person — has become progra@@ m@@ med , elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c and virtual .
The bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y of my brain that divi@@ des real from fan@@ tas@@ y has finally beg@@ un to cru@@ m@@ ble .
I &apos;m a video game ad@@ dic@@ t and this is my story .
( Music ) In the year of my bir@@ th the N@@ inten@@ do En@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment S@@ y@@ ste@@ m also went into develo@@ p@@ ment .
I play@@ ed in the bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard , learned to read , and even ate some of my ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bles .
Mo@@ st of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od was sp@@ ent pla@@ ying with Le@@ gos .
But as was the case for most of my gener@@ ation , I sp@@ ent a lot of time in front of the T@@ V .
M@@ r. R@@ o@@ g@@ ers , W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , N@@ ick J@@ uni@@ or , and rou@@ gh@@ ly half a million com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als have und@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly left their mar@@ k on me .
When my parents b@@ ou@@ ght my si@@ s@@ ter and I our first N@@ inten@@ do , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver in@@ her@@ ent ad@@ dic@@ tive qu@@ ality this early interac@@ tive elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment pos@@ s@@ es@@ sed qu@@ ick@@ ly took h@@ old of me .
A@@ t some point something cli@@ c@@ ked .
( Music ) W@@ ith the com@@ bin@@ ation of simple , interac@@ tive stories and the war@@ m@@ th of the T@@ V set , my simple 1@@ 6@@ -@@ bit N@@ inten@@ do became more than just an es@@ ca@@ pe .
It became an alter@@ na@@ te exist@@ ence , my virtual re@@ ality .
( Music ) I &apos;m a video game ad@@ dic@@ t , and it &apos;s not because of a cer@@ tain number of h@@ our@@ s I have sp@@ ent pla@@ ying , or ni@@ ghts I have g@@ one without s@@ le@@ ep to fin@@ is@@ h the next level .
It is because I have had li@@ fe@@ -@@ alter@@ ing experi@@ ences in virtual space , and video games had beg@@ un to er@@ o@@ de my own underst@@ an@@ ding of what is real and what is not .
I &apos;m ad@@ dic@@ ted , because even though I know I &apos;m lo@@ sing my g@@ ri@@ p on re@@ ality , I still cra@@ ve more .
( Music ) F@@ ro@@ m an early age I learned to inv@@ est myself emo@@ tion@@ ally in what un@@ fol@@ ded before me on s@@ cre@@ en .
To@@ day , after 20 years of wat@@ ching T@@ V ge@@ ar@@ ed to make me emo@@ tional , even a de@@ cent in@@ sur@@ ance com@@ mer@@ cial can br@@ ing te@@ ar@@ s to my eyes .
I am just one of a new gener@@ ation that is gro@@ wing up .
A gener@@ ation who may experience much more me@@ an@@ ing through video games than they will through the real world .
V@@ ide@@ o games are ne@@ ar@@ ing an evolu@@ tion@@ ary lea@@ p , a point where game wor@@ l@@ ds will look and feel just as real as the fil@@ ms we see in the@@ a@@ tres , or the news we wat@@ ch on T@@ V .
And while my sense of f@@ ree will in these virtual wor@@ l@@ ds may still be limi@@ ted , what I do learn ap@@ pli@@ es to my real life .
P@@ la@@ y enough video games and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally you will really believe you can s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ard , f@@ ly a plan@@ e , dri@@ ve a n@@ in@@ e@@ -@@ second qu@@ ar@@ ter mi@@ le , or k@@ ill a man .
I know I can .
Un@@ like any po@@ p culture ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on before it , video games actually al@@ low us to become part of the mach@@ ine .
They al@@ low us to su@@ bli@@ mate into the culture of interac@@ tive , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded , stre@@ am@@ ing , H@@ D re@@ ality .
We are interac@@ ting with our en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment .
I have come to expec@@ t this level of interac@@ tion .
W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , the problems fac@@ ed in the real world — po@@ ver@@ ty , w@@ ar , disease and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de — lack the le@@ vi@@ ty they should .
Th@@ e@@ ir import@@ ance b@@ len@@ ds into the sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ aliz@@ ed dra@@ ma of pri@@ me time T@@ V .
But the be@@ au@@ ty of video games today li@@ es not in the li@@ fe@@ like gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s , the vi@@ bra@@ ting jo@@ y@@ stic@@ ks or virtual sur@@ ro@@ und sound .
It li@@ es in that these games are beg@@ in@@ ning to make me emo@@ tional .
I have f@@ ou@@ ght in war@@ s , f@@ ear@@ ed for my own sur@@ viv@@ al , wat@@ ched my co@@ hor@@ ts di@@ e on be@@ ach@@ es and w@@ oo@@ ds that look and feel more real than any tex@@ t@@ book or any news story .
The people who create these games are s@@ mar@@ t .
They know what makes me s@@ car@@ ed , exci@@ ted , pan@@ ic@@ ked , pro@@ u@@ d or sa@@ d .
Then they use these emo@@ tions to di@@ men@@ sion@@ aliz@@ e the wor@@ l@@ ds they create .
A w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ desig@@ ned video game will se@@ am@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly we@@ a@@ ve the us@@ er into the f@@ abri@@ c of the virtual experience .
As one be@@ comes more experi@@ en@@ ced the a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of physical control mel@@ ts away .
I know what I want and I do it .
No bu@@ tt@@ ons to p@@ us@@ h , no tri@@ gg@@ ers to pul@@ l , just me and the game .
My fa@@ te and the fa@@ te of the world around me li@@ e inside my han@@ ds .
I know viol@@ ent video games make my mother wor@@ ry .
What t@@ rou@@ bles me is not that video game viol@@ ence is be@@ coming more and more like real life viol@@ ence , but that real life viol@@ ence is star@@ ting to look more and more like a video game .
( Music ) These are all t@@ rou@@ bles out@@ side of myself .
I , ho@@ we@@ ver , have a problem very clo@@ se to home .
So@@ me@@ thing has happened to my brain .
( Music ) Per@@ haps there is a single part of our brain that h@@ ol@@ ds all of our gu@@ t inst@@ inc@@ ts , the things we know to do before we even think .
W@@ hi@@ le some of these inst@@ inc@@ ts may be in@@ na@@ te , most are learned , and all of them are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red into our bra@@ ins .
These inst@@ inc@@ ts are es@@ senti@@ al for sur@@ viv@@ al in both real and virtual wor@@ l@@ ds .
O@@ n@@ ly in rec@@ ent years has the technology be@@ hind video games al@@ low@@ ed for a true over@@ la@@ p in sti@@ mul@@ i .
As ga@@ m@@ ers we are now living by the same la@@ ws of physi@@ cs in the same ci@@ ties and doing many of the same things we on@@ ce did in real life , only vir@@ tu@@ ally .
Con@@ si@@ der this — my real life car has about 2@@ 5@@ ,000 miles on it .
In all my dri@@ ving games , I &apos;ve dri@@ ven a tot@@ al of 3@@ 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 5@@ 9 miles .
To some de@@ gre@@ e I &apos;ve learned how to dri@@ ve from the game .
The sen@@ s@@ ory cu@@ es are very similar .
It &apos;s a fun@@ ny fe@@ el@@ ing when you have sp@@ ent more time doing something on the T@@ V than you have in real life .
When I am dri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad at s@@ un@@ set all I can think is , this is almost as beautiful as my games are .
For my virtual wor@@ l@@ ds are perfec@@ t .
M@@ ore beautiful and ri@@ ch than the real world around us .
I &apos;m not sure what the imp@@ lica@@ tions of my experience are , but the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for using re@@ al@@ is@@ tic video game sti@@ mul@@ i in re@@ peti@@ tion on a v@@ ast number of lo@@ y@@ al partici@@ pan@@ ts is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing to me .
To@@ day I believe B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther would find much more suc@@ cess bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing the mas@@ ses with video games ra@@ ther than just simply T@@ V@@ s .
V@@ ide@@ o games are f@@ un , eng@@ aging , and lea@@ ve your brain comple@@ tely vulner@@ able to re@@ -@@ progra@@ mm@@ ing .
But maybe bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing isn &apos;t always bad .
Ima@@ g@@ ine a game that teach@@ es us to res@@ pec@@ t each other , or hel@@ ps us to understand the problems we &apos;re all fac@@ ing in the real world .
There is a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to do good as well .
It is cri@@ tical , as these virtual wor@@ l@@ ds continu@@ e to mir@@ ro@@ r the real world we live in , that game develo@@ per@@ s realiz@@ e that they have tre@@ men@@ dous respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ties before them .
I &apos;m not sure what the future of video games h@@ ol@@ ds for our ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation .
But as virtual and real world experi@@ ences incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly over@@ la@@ p there is a gre@@ ater and gre@@ ater po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for other people to feel the same way I do .
What I have only rec@@ ently come to realiz@@ e is that be@@ y@@ on@@ d the gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s , sound , game play and emo@@ tion it is the power to bre@@ ak down re@@ ality that is so fas@@ cin@@ ating and ad@@ dic@@ tive to me .
I know that I am lo@@ sing my g@@ ri@@ p .
Par@@ t of me is just wa@@ it@@ ing to let go .
I know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how fl@@ at the real world may see@@ m to us , that we must sta@@ y aw@@ are of what our games are teach@@ ing us and how they lea@@ ve us fe@@ el@@ ing when we finally do un@@ p@@ lu@@ g .
( Applause ) D@@ P : W@@ ow . ( Applause )
I found that video very , very thought provo@@ king , and that &apos;s why I wanted to br@@ ing it here for you gu@@ ys to see .
And what was interesting about it is the obvi@@ ous cho@@ ice for me to talk about was gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s and audi@@ o .
But as you heard , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el tal@@ ked about all these other ele@@ ments as well .
V@@ ide@@ o games give an aw@@ ful lot of other things too , and that &apos;s why people get so ad@@ dic@@ ted .
The most important one being f@@ un .
The name of this tra@@ ck is &quot; &quot; The M@@ ag@@ ic To Co@@ me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is that going to come from ?
I@@ s it going to come from the best direc@@ tors in the world as we thought it probably would ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I think it &apos;s going to come from the children who are gro@@ wing up now that ar@@ en &apos;t st@@ uc@@ k with all of the stuff that we remember from the pa@@ st .
They &apos;re going to do it their way , using the to@@ ols that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated .
The same with stud@@ ents or high@@ ly crea@@ tive people , wri@@ ters and people like that .
As far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 3@@ 50 colle@@ ges around the world teach@@ ing video game cour@@ ses .
That means there &apos;s liter@@ ally thousands of new ideas .
So@@ me of the ideas are really dre@@ ad@@ ful and some of them are great .
There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than having to li@@ ste@@ n to someone try and p@@ it@@ ch you a really bad video game idea .
( Laughter ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . That &apos;s it .
He &apos;s out of time .
D@@ P : I &apos;ve just got a little tin@@ y bit more if you &apos;ll in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge me .
C@@ A : G@@ o a@@ head . I &apos;m going to sta@@ y right here though .
( Laughter ) D@@ P : This is just a co@@ ol sho@@ t , because this is stud@@ ents coming to school after cla@@ ss .
The school is clo@@ sed ; they &apos;re coming back at mi@@ d@@ ni@@ ght because they want to p@@ it@@ ch their video game ideas .
I &apos;m si@@ tting at the front of the cla@@ ss , and they &apos;re actually p@@ it@@ ching their ideas .
So it &apos;s hard to get stud@@ ents to come back to cla@@ ss , but it is possible .
This is my da@@ u@@ ghter , her name &apos;s E@@ m@@ ma , she &apos;s 1@@ 7 months old .
And I &apos;ve been as@@ king myself , what is E@@ m@@ ma going to experience in the video game world ?
And as I &apos;ve sho@@ wn here , we have the audi@@ ence .
She &apos;s never going to know a world where you can &apos;t pres@@ s a bu@@ tt@@ on and have mi@@ llions of people ready to play .
You know , we have the technology .
She &apos;s never going to know a world where the gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s just ar@@ en &apos;t st@@ un@@ ning and really im@@ mer@@ sive .
And as the stud@@ ent video sho@@ w@@ ed , we can impac@@ t and move .
She &apos;s never going to know a world where video games ar@@ en &apos;t incre@@ di@@ bly emo@@ tional and will probably make her cr@@ y .
I just hope she li@@ kes video games .
( Laughter ) So , my clo@@ sing thought .
G@@ a@@ mes on the sur@@ face see@@ m simple en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , but for those that like to look a little de@@ e@@ per , the new par@@ adi@@ g@@ m of video games could open enti@@ re@@ ly new fron@@ ti@@ ers to crea@@ tive min@@ ds that like to think big .
Wh@@ ere better to ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge those min@@ ds than here at TED ?
Thank you .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : David Per@@ ry . That was aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a are the ol@@ des@@ t living org@@ an@@ is@@ ms on the ear@@ th .
They &apos;ve been here for bi@@ llions of years , and what they are are sing@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led micro@@ s@@ co@@ pi@@ c org@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
So they are one cell and they have this spe@@ cial pro@@ per@@ ty that they only have one piece of DNA .
They have very few genes , and genetic information to en@@ co@@ de all of the tra@@ its that they car@@ ry out .
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consu@@ me nu@@ tri@@ ents from the environment , they grow to tw@@ ice their size , they c@@ ut themselves down in the mi@@ d@@ dle , and one cell be@@ comes two , and so on and so on .
They just grow and divi@@ de , and grow and divi@@ de — so a kind of bor@@ ing life , ex@@ cep@@ t that what I would ar@@ gue is that you have an amazing interac@@ tion with these cri@@ t@@ ters .
I know you gu@@ ys think of yourself as human@@ s , and this is sort of how I think of you .
This man is sup@@ pos@@ ed to repres@@ ent a gener@@ ic human being , and all of the cir@@ c@@ les in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
So , 10 times more bacteri@@ al cells than human cells on a human being .
And of course it &apos;s the DNA that coun@@ ts , so here &apos;s all the A , T , G@@ s and C@@ s that make up your genetic co@@ de , and give you all your char@@ ming char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics .
You have about 3@@ 0@@ ,000 genes .
Well it tur@@ ns out you have 100 times more bacteri@@ al genes pla@@ ying a ro@@ le in you or on you all of your life .
A@@ t the best , you &apos;re 10 percent human , but more li@@ ke@@ ly about one percent human , depen@@ ding on which of these me@@ tri@@ cs you like .
I know you think of yourself as human be@@ ings , but I think of you as 90 or 9@@ 9 percent bacteri@@ al .
( Laughter ) These bacteria are not pas@@ sive ri@@ ders , these are incre@@ di@@ bly important , they keep us ali@@ ve .
They co@@ ver us in an invi@@ sible body ar@@ mor that ke@@ e@@ ps environ@@ mental in@@ sul@@ ts out so that we sta@@ y health@@ y .
They di@@ g@@ est our food , they make our vi@@ ta@@ min@@ s , they actually edu@@ cate your im@@ mun@@ e system to keep bad micro@@ b@@ es out .
But they get a lot of pres@@ s because they do a lot of terri@@ ble things as well .
So , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no bus@@ in@@ ess being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incre@@ di@@ bly si@@ ck .
And so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do .
I mean they &apos;re incre@@ di@@ bly small , you have to have a micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe to see one .
They live this sort of bor@@ ing life where they grow and divi@@ de , and they &apos;ve always been consider@@ ed to be these a@@ social rec@@ lu@@ sive org@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
And so it see@@ med to us that they are just too small to have an impac@@ t on the environment if they simply ac@@ t as individu@@ als .
The c@@ lue to this came from another mar@@ ine bacteri@@ um , and it &apos;s a bacteri@@ um called Vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i .
What you &apos;re looking at on this sli@@ de is just a person from my lab h@@ ol@@ ding a f@@ la@@ s@@ k of a li@@ qui@@ d culture of a bacteri@@ um , a har@@ m@@ less beautiful bacteri@@ um that comes from the ocean , na@@ med Vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i .
This bacteri@@ um has the spe@@ cial pro@@ per@@ ty that it makes light , so it makes biol@@ u@@ min@@ escen@@ ce , like fi@@ re@@ fli@@ es make light .
We &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
We just took the picture by tur@@ ning the li@@ ghts off in the room , and this is what we see .
What we no@@ tic@@ ed is when the bacteria were al@@ one , so when they were in di@@ lu@@ te s@@ us@@ pen@@ sion , they made no light .
But when they gre@@ w to a cer@@ tain cell number all the bacteria tur@@ ned on light si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously .
The question that we had is how can bacteria , these pri@@ mi@@ tive org@@ an@@ is@@ ms , tell the differ@@ ence from times when they &apos;re al@@ one , and times when they &apos;re in a commun@@ ity , and then all do something together .
This is now sup@@ pos@@ ed to be my bacteri@@ al cell .
When it &apos;s al@@ one it doesn &apos;t make any light .
That &apos;s how biol@@ u@@ min@@ escen@@ ce works — they &apos;re talking with these che@@ mi@@ cal words .
The reason that Vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i is doing that comes from the bio@@ logy .
A@@ ga@@ in , another p@@ lu@@ g for the animals in the ocean , Vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i lives in this s@@ qui@@ d .
The s@@ qui@@ d is no@@ c@@ tur@@ n@@ al , so dur@@ ing the day it bu@@ ri@@ es it@@ self in the s@@ and and s@@ le@@ e@@ ps , but then at ni@@ ght it has to come out to hun@@ t .
O@@ n b@@ right ni@@ ghts when there is l@@ ots of star@@ light or mo@@ on@@ light that light can pen@@ e@@ tra@@ te the de@@ p@@ th of the water the s@@ qui@@ d lives in , sin@@ ce it &apos;s just in those cou@@ ple fe@@ et of water .
What the s@@ qui@@ d has developed is a s@@ hu@@ tter that can open and clo@@ se over this speci@@ aliz@@ ed light org@@ an h@@ ou@@ sing the bacteria .
Then it has detec@@ tors on its back so it can sense how much star@@ light or mo@@ on@@ light is h@@ it@@ ting its back .
( Laughter ) But then if you think about it , the s@@ qui@@ d has this terri@@ ble problem because it &apos;s got this d@@ ying , th@@ ick culture of bacteria and it can &apos;t s@@ us@@ tain that .
Now the bacteria are di@@ lu@@ te , that little hor@@ m@@ one mole@@ cu@@ le is g@@ one , so they &apos;re not making light — but of course the s@@ qui@@ d doesn &apos;t care . It &apos;s as@@ le@@ ep in the s@@ and .
And the bacteria also have a recep@@ tor on their cell sur@@ face that f@@ its like a lo@@ ck and k@@ ey with that mole@@ cu@@ le .
These are just like the recep@@ tors on the sur@@ fac@@ es of your cells .
When the mole@@ cu@@ le incre@@ ases to a cer@@ tain amount — which says something about the number of cells — it lo@@ c@@ ks down into that recep@@ tor and information comes into the cells that te@@ lls the cells to turn on this col@@ lec@@ tive behavi@@ or of making light .
Why this is interesting is because in the pa@@ st deca@@ de we have found that this is not just some an@@ o@@ mal@@ y of this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , glo@@ w@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ dar@@ k bacteri@@ um that lives in the ocean — all bacteria have syste@@ ms like this .
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
They make che@@ mi@@ cal words , they recogni@@ ze those words , and they turn on gro@@ up behavi@@ ors that are only suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful when all of the cells partici@@ pa@@ te in un@@ is@@ on .
We have a fan@@ cy name for this : we call it qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing .
They v@@ ote with these che@@ mi@@ cal v@@ ot@@ es , the v@@ ote gets coun@@ ted , and then every@@ body respon@@ ds to the v@@ ote .
What &apos;s important for today &apos;s talk is that we know that there are hundre@@ ds of behavi@@ ors that bacteria car@@ ry out in these col@@ lec@@ tive fas@@ hi@@ ons .
But the one that &apos;s probably the most important to you is vir@@ ul@@ ence .
It &apos;s not like a cou@@ ple bacteria get in you and they start se@@ cre@@ ting some to@@ x@@ ins — you &apos;re enor@@ mous , that would have no effec@@ t on you . You &apos;re hu@@ ge .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a always control path@@ o@@ gen@@ i@@ city with qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing .
We also then went to look at what are these mole@@ cul@@ es — these were the red tri@@ an@@ g@@ les on my sli@@ des before .
This is the Vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i mole@@ cu@@ le .
This is the word that it tal@@ ks with .
So then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a s@@ ma@@ tter@@ ing of the mole@@ cul@@ es that we &apos;ve disco@@ vered .
What I hope you can see is that the mole@@ cul@@ es are rela@@ ted .
The le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand part of the mole@@ cu@@ le is iden@@ tical in every single species of bacteria .
But the ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ hand part of the mole@@ cu@@ le is a little bit different in every single species .
What that does is to con@@ fer ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te species speci@@ fici@@ ties to these langu@@ ages .
E@@ ach mole@@ cu@@ le f@@ its into its par@@ t@@ ner recep@@ tor and no other .
So these are priva@@ te , se@@ cre@@ t conversa@@ tions .
These conversa@@ tions are for in@@ tra@@ species communi@@ cation .
E@@ ach bacteria us@@ es a particular mole@@ cu@@ le that &apos;s its language that al@@ lo@@ ws it to coun@@ t its own si@@ b@@ l@@ ings .
And that &apos;s de@@ pic@@ ted on this sli@@ de . This is your sk@@ in .
So this is just a picture — a micro@@ gra@@ p@@ h of your sk@@ in .
And so we started to think if this really is about communi@@ cation in bacteria , and it &apos;s about coun@@ ting your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors , it &apos;s not enough to be able to only talk within your species .
So , they have a second en@@ z@@ y@@ me that makes a second si@@ gn@@ al and it has its own recep@@ tor , and this mole@@ cu@@ le is the tra@@ de language of bacteria .
It &apos;s used by all different bacteria and it &apos;s the language of inter@@ species communi@@ cation .
What happens is that bacteria are able to coun@@ t how many of me and how many of you .
They take that information inside , and they deci@@ de what tas@@ ks to car@@ ry out depen@@ ding on who &apos;s in the min@@ or@@ ity and who &apos;s in the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of any given population .
It &apos;s a very small , fi@@ ve@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ on mole@@ cu@@ le .
So they &apos;re all using this mole@@ cu@@ le for inter@@ species communi@@ cation .
This is the bacteri@@ al Es@@ per@@ an@@ to .
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something prac@@ tical that we can do here as well .
O@@ f course , I &apos;ve also told you that one of the important things they do is to ini@@ ti@@ ate path@@ o@@ gen@@ i@@ city using qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing .
C@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibio@@ tics ?
O@@ f course , you &apos;ve just heard and you already know that we &apos;re run@@ ning out of antibio@@ tics .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a are incre@@ di@@ bly multi@@ -@@ dru@@ g@@ -@@ resist@@ ant right now , and that &apos;s because all of the antibio@@ tics that we use k@@ ill bacteria .
They ei@@ ther po@@ p the bacteri@@ al me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ e , they make the bacteri@@ um so it can &apos;t re@@ pli@@ cate its DNA .
And so now of course we have this global problem in infec@@ ti@@ ous dise@@ ases .
And so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve sort of ta@@ ken two stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es .
The first one is we &apos;ve tar@@ ge@@ ted the in@@ tra@@ species communi@@ cation system .
So we made mole@@ cul@@ es that look kind of like the real mole@@ cul@@ es — which you saw — but they &apos;re a little bit different .
We &apos;ve ta@@ ken that univer@@ sa@@ l mole@@ cu@@ le and tur@@ ned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made an@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ ist@@ s of the inter@@ species communi@@ cation system .
The hope is that these will be used as bro@@ ad@@ -@@ spec@@ tru@@ m antibio@@ tics that work aga@@ in@@ st all bacteria .
To fin@@ is@@ h I &apos;ll just show you the stra@@ te@@ gy .
In this one I &apos;m just using the inter@@ species mole@@ cu@@ le , but the logi@@ c is exactly the same .
What you know is that when that bacteri@@ um gets into the animal , in this case , a m@@ ouse , it doesn &apos;t ini@@ ti@@ ate vir@@ ul@@ ence right away .
It gets in , it star@@ ts gro@@ wing , it star@@ ts se@@ cre@@ ting its qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing mole@@ cul@@ es .
It recogni@@ z@@ es when it has enough bacteria that now they &apos;re going to la@@ un@@ ch their at@@ ta@@ ck , and the animal dies .
What we &apos;ve been able to do is to give these vir@@ ul@@ ent infec@@ tions , but we give them in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with our anti@@ -@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing mole@@ cul@@ es — so these are mole@@ cul@@ es that look kind of like the real thing , but they &apos;re a little bit different which I &apos;ve de@@ pic@@ ted on this sli@@ de .
What we now know is that if we tre@@ at the animal with a path@@ o@@ gen@@ ic bacteri@@ um — a multi@@ -@@ dru@@ g@@ -@@ resist@@ ant path@@ o@@ gen@@ ic bacteri@@ um — in the same time we give our anti@@ -@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing mole@@ cu@@ le , in fact , the animal lives .
O@@ f course what that al@@ lo@@ ws bacteria to do is to be mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lu@@ lar .
So in the spi@@ ri@@ t of TED they &apos;re doing things together because it makes a differ@@ ence .
What happens is that bacteria have these col@@ lec@@ tive behavi@@ ors , and they can car@@ ry out tas@@ ks that they could never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh if they simply ac@@ ted as individu@@ als .
What I would hope that I could f@@ ur@@ ther ar@@ gue to you is that this is the in@@ ven@@ tion of mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lul@@ ar@@ ity .
We think , by stud@@ ying bacteria , we &apos;re going to be able to have in@@ si@@ ght about mul@@ tic@@ el@@ lul@@ ar@@ ity in the human body .
I hope that what you &apos;ve learned is that bacteria can distin@@ gu@@ is@@ h self from other .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
The final thing is , again just to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate that there &apos;s this prac@@ tical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti@@ -@@ qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing mole@@ cul@@ es that are being developed as new kinds of ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tics .
What we &apos;re also trying to do is to be@@ e@@ f up the conversa@@ tion of the bacteria that live as mu@@ tu@@ ali@@ sts with you , in the ho@@ pes of making you more health@@ y , making those conversa@@ tions better , so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .
I keep getting ol@@ der and ol@@ der and they &apos;re always the same age , and it &apos;s just a cra@@ z@@ y de@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ ful job .
I want to th@@ ank you for invi@@ ting me here .
It &apos;s a big tre@@ at for me to get to come to this con@@ fer@@ ence .
Well , I &apos;m an ocean che@@ mi@@ st .
The over@@ all fe@@ atur@@ es are extre@@ me@@ ly e@@ as@@ y to understand .
The po@@ lar re@@ gi@@ ons are co@@ ld because there &apos;s less s@@ un@@ light .
So we &apos;re pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this .
You &apos;re probably see@@ ing new species .
To do that , we need to char@@ ter a research bo@@ at .
Gre@@ at , if you &apos;re not a great mar@@ in@@ er .
So@@ me@@ times it loo@@ ks a little more like this .
This is a s@@ w@@ im@@ ming ho@@ lo@@ th@@ u@@ ri@@ an — it &apos;s a small sea s@@ lu@@ g , basi@@ cally .
This is a beautiful ho@@ lo@@ th@@ u@@ ri@@ an as well .
And this animal you &apos;re going to see coming up was a big sur@@ pri@@ se .
This was@@ n &apos;t what we were looking for .
You &apos;re going to see a picture of one in a moment .
A@@ n org@@ an@@ ism like this probably lives for about a hundre@@ d years .
This is what makes me really un@@ popu@@ lar with my research te@@ am .
So I want to lea@@ ve you with this last sli@@ de .
It &apos;s just a beautiful place .
This devi@@ ce consi@@ sts of a lar@@ ge , ro@@ und table and some mach@@ in@@ er@@ y .
When the woman is ready to de@@ li@@ ver her child , she li@@ es on her back , she is stra@@ p@@ ped down to the table , and the table is r@@ ot@@ ated at high spe@@ ed .
The child comes fl@@ ying out through cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ce .
And it tur@@ ns out the answer to that is because their bra@@ ins are p@@ ac@@ k@@ ag@@ ed inside their sk@@ ul@@ ls in a way different from the way our bra@@ ins , we being human be@@ ings , true , have our bra@@ ins p@@ ac@@ k@@ ag@@ ed .
They , the w@@ oo@@ d@@ pec@@ kers , ty@@ pic@@ ally will pe@@ ck , they will ban@@ g their head on a piece of wo@@ od thousands of times every day . E@@ very day !
And as far as any@@ one kno@@ ws , that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther them in the sli@@ gh@@ test .
Th@@ e@@ ir brain does not s@@ lo@@ sh around like our@@ s does .
Th@@ e@@ ir brain is p@@ ac@@ ked in very ti@@ gh@@ tly , at le@@ ast for blo@@ ws coming right from the front .
And the w@@ oo@@ d@@ pec@@ ker maybe rela@@ tes to that .
The man had c@@ ut his f@@ ing@@ er , he worked pro@@ ces@@ sing ch@@ ick@@ ens , and then he started to s@@ me@@ ll really , really bad .
It was in@@ to@@ ler@@ able .
They tri@@ ed every drug , every other tre@@ at@@ ment they could think of .
Af@@ ter two years , still s@@ mel@@ led pu@@ tri@@ d .
Af@@ ter five years , it went away on its own .
It &apos;s a my@@ ster@@ y .
In Ne@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , D@@ r. Li@@ an@@ ne Par@@ k@@ in and her te@@ am t@@ es@@ ted an old tradi@@ tion in her city .
They live in a city that has hu@@ ge hi@@ lls , S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ -@@ gra@@ de hi@@ lls .
And in the win@@ ter there , it gets very co@@ ld and very ic@@ y .
There are l@@ ots of in@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es .
The tradi@@ tion that they t@@ es@@ ted , they t@@ es@@ ted by as@@ king people who were on their way to work in the mor@@ ning , to stop and try something out .
T@@ ry one of two condi@@ tions .
The tradi@@ tion is that in the win@@ ter , in that city , you we@@ ar your so@@ c@@ ks on the out@@ side of your bo@@ ots .
And what they disco@@ vered by experi@@ ment , and it was quite gra@@ phi@@ c when they saw it , was that it &apos;s true .
That if you we@@ ar your so@@ c@@ ks on the out@@ side ra@@ ther than the inside , you &apos;re much more li@@ ke@@ ly to sur@@ vi@@ ve and not sli@@ p and f@@ all .
In 19@@ 9@@ 1 , I , together with bun@@ ch of other people , started the I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze cere@@ mon@@ y .
E@@ very year we give out 10 pri@@ z@@ es .
The pri@@ z@@ es are based on just one cri@@ teri@@ a . It &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s that you &apos;ve done something that makes people la@@ u@@ gh and then think .
What you &apos;ve done makes people la@@ u@@ gh and then think .
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it is , there &apos;s something about it that when people en@@ coun@@ ter it at first , their only possible reac@@ tion is to la@@ u@@ gh .
That &apos;s the qu@@ ality we look for .
E@@ very year , we get in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of 9@@ ,000 new no@@ min@@ ations for the I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze .
O@@ f those , consi@@ st@@ ently between 10 percent and 20 percent of those no@@ min@@ ations are people who no@@ min@@ ate themselves .
Th@@ ose sel@@ f-@@ no@@ min@@ e@@ es almost never w@@ in .
E@@ ven if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t nu@@ mer@@ ic@@ ally .
You should know that when we cho@@ ose somebody to w@@ in an I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze , We get in tou@@ ch with that person , very qui@@ e@@ tly .
We of@@ fer them the chan@@ ce to de@@ c@@ line this great hon@@ or if they want to .
H@@ ap@@ pi@@ ly for us , almost everyone who &apos;s of@@ fer@@ ed a pri@@ ze deci@@ des to ac@@ cep@@ t .
What do you get if you w@@ in an I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze ?
Well , you get se@@ ver@@ al things .
You get an I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze .
The desig@@ n is different every year .
These are always han@@ d@@ made from extre@@ me@@ ly che@@ a@@ p materi@@ als .
You &apos;re looking at a picture of the pri@@ ze we ga@@ ve last year , 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
Mo@@ st pri@@ z@@ es in the world also give their win@@ n@@ ers some ca@@ sh , some money .
We don &apos;t have any money , so we can &apos;t give them .
In fact , the win@@ n@@ ers have to pa@@ y their own way to come to the I@@ g No@@ bel cere@@ mon@@ y , which most of them do .
L@@ ast year , though , we did man@@ age to s@@ cra@@ pe up some money .
L@@ ast year , each of the 10 I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers rece@@ i@@ ved from us 10 tri@@ llion dollars .
A $ 10 tri@@ llion bi@@ ll from Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we . ( Laughter ) You may remember that Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we had a little ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure for a few years there of inf@@ lation .
They en@@ ded up pr@@ in@@ ting bi@@ lls that were in den@@ o@@ min@@ ations as lar@@ ge as 100 tri@@ llion dollars .
The man respon@@ sible , who r@@ uns the national b@@ ank there , by the way , w@@ on an I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze in ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics .
It f@@ its 1@@ ,@@ 100 people , it &apos;s j@@ am@@ med to the gi@@ lls , and up on the sta@@ ge , wa@@ it@@ ing to s@@ ha@@ ke your hand , wa@@ it@@ ing to hand you your I@@ g No@@ bel pri@@ ze , are a bun@@ ch of No@@ bel pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers .
That &apos;s the heart of the cere@@ mon@@ y .
The win@@ n@@ ers are ke@@ pt se@@ cre@@ t until that moment , even the No@@ bel la@@ u@@ re@@ ates who will s@@ ha@@ ke their hand don &apos;t know who they are until they &apos;re an@@ no@@ un@@ ced .
I am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medi@@ cal@@ -@@ rela@@ ted pri@@ z@@ es we &apos;ve given .
K@@ e@@ ep in mind , we &apos;ve given 2@@ 30 pri@@ z@@ es .
There are l@@ ots of these people who wal@@ k a@@ mon@@ g you .
Ma@@ ybe you have one .
A pa@@ per was publi@@ sh@@ ed about 30 years ago called &quot; &quot; In@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es du@@ e to F@@ al@@ ling Co@@ con@@ u@@ ts . &quot; &quot; It was wri@@ t@@ ten by D@@ r. Pe@@ ter B@@ ar@@ ss , who is Can@@ adi@@ an .
D@@ r. B@@ ar@@ ss came to the cere@@ mon@@ y and ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed that as a young doc@@ tor , he wanted to see the world .
So he went to P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Ne@@ w Gu@@ in@@ e@@ a .
One ty@@ pi@@ cal thing that happens is people will come from the high@@ lan@@ ds , where there are not many co@@ con@@ ut tre@@ es , down to visi@@ t their rela@@ tiv@@ es on the co@@ ast , where there are l@@ ots .
And they &apos;ll think that a co@@ con@@ ut t@@ ree is a fin@@ e place to st@@ and and maybe li@@ e down .
A co@@ con@@ ut t@@ ree that is 90 fe@@ et t@@ all , and has co@@ con@@ u@@ ts that we@@ i@@ gh two po@@ unds that can dro@@ p off at any time .
A te@@ am of doc@@ tors in Europe publi@@ sh@@ ed a seri@@ es of pa@@ per@@ s about co@@ lon@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es .
You &apos;re all famili@@ ar with co@@ lon@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es , one way or another .
O@@ r in some ca@@ ses , one way and another .
And there were some dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ties at first .
The ba@@ sic problem , I &apos;m sure you &apos;re famili@@ ar with , that you &apos;re looking inside a long , n@@ ar@@ row , dar@@ k place .
And so , you want to have a lar@@ ger space .
You ad@@ d some gas to inf@@ late it so you have room to look around .
Now , that &apos;s ad@@ ded to the gas , the me@@ th@@ an@@ e gas , that &apos;s already inside .
The gas that they used at first , in many ca@@ ses , was o@@ x@@ y@@ gen .
So they ad@@ ded o@@ x@@ y@@ gen to me@@ th@@ an@@ e gas .
So you had me@@ th@@ an@@ e gas , which is f@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ ble , o@@ x@@ y@@ gen and he@@ at .
One to sa@@ ve your life , one to sa@@ ve the life of some l@@ uc@@ k@@ y b@@ y@@ stan@@ der . ( Laughter ) Why would someone do this , you might won@@ der .
D@@ r. Bo@@ d@@ n@@ ar came to the cere@@ mon@@ y and she ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed that she gre@@ w up in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
And they later disco@@ vered that a lot of the wor@@ st medical problems came from the partic@@ les people bre@@ a@@ the@@ d in .
Y@@ ear@@ s later , she mo@@ ved to America .
She had a bab@@ y , One day she looked , and on the flo@@ or , her inf@@ ant son had pic@@ ked up her br@@ a , and had her br@@ a on his face .
And that &apos;s where the idea came from .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Okay , reli@@ gi@@ ous man@@ ia : there &apos;s rap@@ ture , there &apos;s wee@@ ping , there &apos;s visi@@ ons .
M@@ ani@@ as can be good .
A man@@ ia for learning English .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down !
T : Mo@@ st import@@ an@@ tly ... S : Mo@@ st import@@ an@@ tly ...
How many people are trying to learn English wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ?
Ima@@ g@@ ine a stud@@ ent taking a gi@@ ant test for three full days .
T : I want to spe@@ ak perfec@@ t English !
S ( y@@ el@@ ling more l@@ ou@@ d@@ ly ) : I want to change my life !
I@@ s English a t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , was@@ hing away other langu@@ ages ?
The world has other univer@@ sa@@ l langu@@ ages .
I started I@@ m@@ pro@@ v E@@ very@@ where about 10 years ago when I mo@@ ved to Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity with an inter@@ est in ac@@ ting and come@@ dy .
Because I was new to the city , I didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to a sta@@ ge , so I decided to create my own in publi@@ c places .
So the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first No P@@ an@@ ts Su@@ b@@ way R@@ i@@ de .
Now this took place in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary of 200@@ 2 .
And this woman is the s@@ tar of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being fil@@ med .
She &apos;s being fil@@ med with a hi@@ d@@ den cam@@ era .
This is on the 6 tra@@ in in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
And this is the first stop al@@ ong the line .
These are two D@@ an@@ is@@ h gu@@ ys who come out and si@@ t down next to the hi@@ d@@ den cam@@ era .
And that &apos;s me right there in a bro@@ wn co@@ at .
It &apos;s about 30 de@@ gre@@ es out@@ side .
I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing a h@@ at . I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing a s@@ car@@ f .
And the gir@@ l &apos;s going to no@@ tice me right here .
( Laughter ) And as you &apos;ll see now , I &apos;m not w@@ ear@@ ing pan@@ ts . ( Laughter )
So at this point — at this point she &apos;s no@@ tic@@ ed me , but in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k there &apos;s we@@ ir@@ dos on any given tra@@ in car .
One person &apos;s not that un@@ us@@ u@@ al .
She goes back to read@@ ing her book , which is un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; R@@ ap@@ e . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So she &apos;s no@@ tic@@ ed the un@@ us@@ u@@ al thing , but she &apos;s g@@ one back to her normal life .
Now in the me@@ an@@ time , I have six fri@@ ends who are wa@@ it@@ ing at the next six conse@@ cu@@ tive st@@ op@@ s in their under@@ we@@ ar as well .
They &apos;re going to be en@@ ter@@ ing this car one by one .
We &apos;ll ac@@ t as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And we &apos;ll ac@@ t as if it &apos;s just an un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate mi@@ sta@@ ke we &apos;ve made , for@@ getting our pan@@ ts on this co@@ ld J@@ an@@ u@@ ary day .
( Laughter ) So at this point , she deci@@ des to put the ra@@ pe book away . ( Laughter )
And she deci@@ des to be a little bit more aw@@ are of her sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings .
Now in the me@@ an@@ time , the two D@@ an@@ is@@ h gu@@ ys to the left of the cam@@ era , they &apos;re cra@@ c@@ king up .
They think this is the fun@@ ni@@ est thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
And wat@@ ch her make ey@@ e con@@ tac@@ t with them right about now .
( Laughter ) And I love that moment in this video , because before it became a shar@@ ed experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit s@@ car@@ y , or something that was at le@@ ast con@@ f@@ using to her .
And then on@@ ce it became a shar@@ ed experience , it was fun@@ ny and something that she could la@@ u@@ gh at .
So the tra@@ in is now pul@@ ling into the th@@ ird stop al@@ ong the 6 line .
( Laughter ) So the video w@@ on &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four st@@ op@@ s .
A tot@@ al of se@@ ven gu@@ ys en@@ ter an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ously in their under@@ we@@ ar .
A@@ t the ei@@ gh@@ th stop , a gir@@ l came in with a gi@@ ant du@@ f@@ fe@@ l ba@@ g and an@@ no@@ un@@ ced she had pan@@ ts for sal@@ e for a dol@@ lar — like you might se@@ ll bat@@ teri@@ es or can@@ dy on the tra@@ in .
We all very matter of fac@@ tly b@@ ou@@ ght a pa@@ ir of pan@@ ts , put them on and said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . That &apos;s exactly what I nee@@ ded today , &quot; &quot; and then ex@@ i@@ ted without re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing what had happened and went in all different direc@@ tions .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that gir@@ l &apos;s reac@@ tion so much .
And wat@@ ching that vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e later that day in@@ spi@@ red me to keep doing what I do .
And really one of the po@@ in@@ ts of I@@ m@@ pro@@ v E@@ very@@ where is to cause a s@@ cen@@ e in a publi@@ c place that is a posi@@ tive experience for other people .
It &apos;s a pr@@ ank , but it &apos;s a pr@@ ank that gi@@ ves somebody a great story to tell .
And her reac@@ tion in@@ spi@@ red me to do a second an@@ nu@@ al No P@@ an@@ ts Su@@ b@@ way R@@ i@@ de .
And we &apos;ve continu@@ ed to do it every year .
This J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , we did the 10@@ th an@@ nu@@ al No P@@ an@@ ts Su@@ b@@ way R@@ i@@ de where a diver@@ se gro@@ up of 3@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people ro@@ de the tra@@ in in their under@@ we@@ ar in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k — almost every single tra@@ in line in the city .
And also in 50 other ci@@ ties around the world , people partici@@ pa@@ ted .
( Laughter ) As I started taking impro@@ v cla@@ ss at the U@@ pri@@ ght C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens Bri@@ ga@@ de Th@@ e@@ ater and me@@ e@@ ting other crea@@ tive people and other per@@ for@@ m@@ ers and co@@ medi@@ ans , I started ama@@ s@@ sing a ma@@ il@@ ing li@@ st of people who wanted to do these ty@@ pes of pro@@ jects .
So I could do more lar@@ ge@@ -@@ s@@ cal@@ e pro@@ jects .
Well one day I was wal@@ king through Uni@@ on S@@ qu@@ are , and I saw this buil@@ ding , which had just been buil@@ t in 200@@ 5 .
And there was a gir@@ l in one of the win@@ do@@ ws and she was dan@@ c@@ ing .
And it was very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , because it was dar@@ k out , but she was bac@@ k@@ -@@ li@@ t with fl@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ gh@@ ting , and she was very much on@@ sta@@ ge , and I coul@@ dn &apos;t figur@@ e out why she was doing it .
Af@@ ter about 15 secon@@ ds , her fri@@ end ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed — she had been hi@@ ding be@@ hind a dis@@ play — and they la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed and hu@@ gg@@ ed each other and ran away .
So it see@@ med like maybe she had been dar@@ ed to do this .
So I got in@@ spi@@ red by that .
L@@ oo@@ king at the entire fa@@ ca@@ de — there were 70 tot@@ al win@@ do@@ ws — and I knew what I had to do .
( Laughter ) So this project is called L@@ oo@@ k U@@ p M@@ ore . We had 70 ac@@ tors d@@ ress in black .
This was comple@@ tely un@@ au@@ th@@ ori@@ zed .
We didn &apos;t let the st@@ ores know we were coming .
And I sto@@ od in the par@@ k gi@@ ving si@@ gn@@ als .
The first si@@ gn@@ al was for every@@ body to h@@ old up these f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ o@@ t t@@ all le@@ t@@ ters that spe@@ l@@ led out &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k U@@ p M@@ ore , &quot; &quot; the name of the project .
The second si@@ gn@@ al was for every@@ body to do J@@ u@@ mp@@ ing j@@ ac@@ ks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
( Laughter ) And then we had dan@@ c@@ ing . We had everyone d@@ ance .
And then we had d@@ ance so@@ los where only one person would d@@ ance and every@@ body would point to them .
( Laughter ) So then I ga@@ ve a new hand si@@ gn@@ al , which si@@ gn@@ al@@ ed the next so@@ lo@@ ist down be@@ low in Fo@@ re@@ ver 2@@ 1 , and he dan@@ ced .
There were se@@ ver@@ al other activi@@ ties .
We had people j@@ u@@ mp@@ ing up and down , people dro@@ p@@ ping to the ground .
And I was stan@@ ding just an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ously in a s@@ we@@ at@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , pu@@ tting my hand on and off of a tra@@ sh@@ can to si@@ gn@@ al the ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ment .
And because it was in Uni@@ on S@@ qu@@ are Par@@ k , right by a sub@@ way sta@@ tion , there were hundre@@ ds of people by the end who st@@ op@@ ped and looked up and wat@@ ched what we were doing .
There &apos;s a better p@@ ho@@ to of it .
So that particular ev@@ ent was in@@ spi@@ red by a moment that I happened to stu@@ m@@ ble u@@ po@@ n .
The next project I want to show was given to me in an e@@ mai@@ l from a st@@ ran@@ ger .
A high school kid in T@@ ex@@ as w@@ r@@ ote me in 200@@ 6 and said , &quot; &quot; You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo sh@@ ir@@ ts and k@@ ha@@ k@@ i pan@@ ts and go into a B@@ est B@@ u@@ y and st@@ and around . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I w@@ r@@ ote this high school kid back im@@ medi@@ ately , and I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you are correc@@ t .
I think I &apos;ll try to do that this wee@@ k@@ end . Thank you . &quot; &quot; So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 200@@ 5 .
This is the B@@ est B@@ u@@ y in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
We had about 80 people show up to partici@@ pa@@ te , en@@ ter@@ ing on@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ one .
There was an ei@@ ght year@@ -old gir@@ l , a 10 year@@ -old gir@@ l .
There was also a 6@@ 5 year@@ -old man who partici@@ pa@@ ted .
So a very diver@@ se gro@@ up of people .
And I told people , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t work . D@@ on &apos;t actually do work .
But also , don &apos;t sho@@ p .
J@@ ust st@@ and around and don &apos;t face produc@@ ts . &quot; &quot; Now you can see the regu@@ lar emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es by the ones that have the y@@ el@@ low ta@@ gs on their sh@@ ir@@ t .
E@@ very@@ body else is one of our ac@@ tors .
( Laughter ) The lo@@ wer level emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es thought it was very fun@@ ny .
And in fact , se@@ ver@@ al of them went to go get their cam@@ era from the bre@@ ak room and took phot@@ os with us .
A lot of them made jo@@ kes about trying to get us to go to the back to get he@@ av@@ y tele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ ts for cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers .
The man@@ ag@@ ers and the se@@ curi@@ ty gu@@ ar@@ ds , on the other hand , did not find it partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly fun@@ ny .
You can see them in this fo@@ ot@@ age .
They &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing ei@@ ther a y@@ el@@ low sh@@ ir@@ t or a black sh@@ ir@@ t .
And we were there probably 10 minu@@ tes before the man@@ ag@@ ers decided to di@@ al 9@@ 1@@ 1 .
( Laughter ) So they started run@@ ning around telling every@@ body the co@@ ps were coming , wat@@ ch out , the co@@ ps were coming .
And you can see the co@@ ps in this fo@@ ot@@ age right here .
That &apos;s a co@@ p w@@ ear@@ ing black right there , being fil@@ med with a hi@@ d@@ den cam@@ era .
U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , the poli@@ ce had to in@@ form B@@ est B@@ u@@ y man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment that it was not , in fact , il@@ le@@ g@@ al to we@@ ar a blue polo sh@@ ir@@ t and k@@ ha@@ k@@ i pan@@ ts .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
So we had been there for 20 minu@@ tes ; we were happ@@ y to ex@@ it the st@@ ore .
One thing the man@@ ag@@ ers were trying to do was to tra@@ ck down our ca@@ mer@@ as .
And they ca@@ u@@ ght a cou@@ ple of my gu@@ ys who had hi@@ d@@ den ca@@ mer@@ as in du@@ f@@ fe@@ l b@@ ag@@ s .
But the one cam@@ era guy they never ca@@ u@@ ght was the guy that went in just with a b@@ lan@@ k ta@@ pe and went over to the B@@ est B@@ u@@ y cam@@ era de@@ par@@ t@@ ment and just put his ta@@ pe in one of their ca@@ mer@@ as and pre@@ ten@@ ded to sho@@ p .
So I like that concep@@ t of using their own technology aga@@ in@@ st them .
( Laughter ) I think our best pro@@ jects are ones that are si@@ te speci@@ fic and happen at a particular place for a reason .
And one mor@@ ning , I was ri@@ ding the sub@@ way .
I had to make a trans@@ fer at the 5@@ 3@@ r@@ d S@@ t@@ . stop where there are these two gi@@ ant escal@@ at@@ ors .
And it &apos;s a very depres@@ sing place to be in the mor@@ ning , it &apos;s very cro@@ w@@ ded .
So I decided to try and sta@@ ge something that could make it as happ@@ y as possible for one mor@@ ning .
So this was in the win@@ ter of 200@@ 9 — 8 : 30 in the mor@@ ning .
It &apos;s mor@@ ning r@@ us@@ h h@@ our .
It &apos;s very co@@ ld out@@ side .
People are coming in from Qu@@ e@@ ens , trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing from the E tra@@ in to the 6 tra@@ in .
And they &apos;re going up these gi@@ ant escal@@ at@@ ors on their way to their j@@ ob@@ s .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
So there &apos;s a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h that ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tes it a little bit better .
He ga@@ ve 2@@ ,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he was@@ h@@ ed his han@@ ds before and af@@ ter@@ ward and did not get si@@ ck .
And that was done also without permi@@ s@@ sion , al@@ though no one see@@ med to care .
So I &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common cri@@ tici@@ s@@ ms I see of I@@ m@@ pro@@ v E@@ very@@ where left an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ously on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be com@@ ments is : &quot; &quot; These people have too much time on their han@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And you know , not every@@ body &apos;s going to like everything you do , and I &apos;ve cer@@ tain@@ ly developed a th@@ ick sk@@ in th@@ an@@ ks to Internet com@@ ments , but that one &apos;s always bo@@ ther@@ ed me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our han@@ ds .
The partici@@ pan@@ ts at I@@ m@@ pro@@ v E@@ very@@ where ev@@ ents have just as much le@@ is@@ ure time as any other Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ kers , they just oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally cho@@ ose to s@@ pen@@ d it in an un@@ us@@ u@@ al way .
You know , every S@@ atur@@ day and S@@ un@@ day , hundre@@ ds of thousands of people each f@@ all ga@@ ther in fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all sta@@ di@@ u@@ ms to wat@@ ch games .
And I &apos;ve never seen any@@ body com@@ ment , looking at a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all game , saying , &quot; &quot; All those people in the stan@@ ds , they have too much time on their han@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s a perfec@@ tly wonderful way to sp@@ ent a wee@@ k@@ end af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , wat@@ ching a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all game in a sta@@ di@@ um .
But I think it &apos;s also a perfec@@ tly v@@ ali@@ d way to s@@ pen@@ d an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on f@@ ree@@ zing in place with 200 people in the G@@ r@@ and C@@ ent@@ ral termin@@ al or d@@ res@@ sing up like a gh@@ o@@ st@@ bus@@ ter and run@@ ning through the Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k P@@ u@@ bli@@ c Li@@ br@@ ary .
( Laughter ) O@@ r listen@@ ing to the same M@@ P@@ 3 as 3@@ ,000 other people and dan@@ c@@ ing si@@ l@@ ently in a par@@ k , or bur@@ st@@ ing into son@@ g in a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore as part of a s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous mu@@ si@@ cal , or di@@ ving into the ocean in Con@@ ey Is@@ land w@@ ear@@ ing forma@@ l at@@ ti@@ re .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re ta@@ u@@ ght to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just ac@@ cep@@ table that play is a good thing .
And I think that &apos;s sort of the point of I@@ m@@ pro@@ v E@@ very@@ where .
It &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
As long as it &apos;s f@@ un and it see@@ ms like it &apos;s going to be a fun@@ ny idea and it see@@ ms like the people who w@@ it@@ ness it will also have a f@@ un time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
And I think , as adul@@ ts , we need to learn that there &apos;s no right or wrong way to play .
Thank you very much .

So I &apos;m a neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on .
And like most of my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , I have to de@@ al , every day , with human tra@@ ge@@ dies .
I realiz@@ e how your life can change from one second to the other after a ma@@ j@@ or st@@ ro@@ ke or after a car ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
And what is very f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ting for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is to realiz@@ e that un@@ like other org@@ ans of the body , the brain has very little ability for sel@@ f-@@ re@@ pa@@ ir .
And after a ma@@ j@@ or in@@ j@@ ur@@ y of your cent@@ ral ner@@ v@@ ous system , the patients of@@ ten rema@@ in with a se@@ ver@@ e han@@ di@@ ca@@ p .
And that &apos;s probably the reason why I &apos;ve cho@@ sen to be a func@@ tional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on .
What is a func@@ tional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on ?
It &apos;s a doc@@ tor who is trying to impro@@ ve a neuro@@ logical func@@ tion through different sur@@ gi@@ cal stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es .
You &apos;ve cer@@ tain@@ ly heard of one of the fa@@ mous ones called de@@ ep brain sti@@ mu@@ lation , where you imp@@ l@@ ant an elec@@ tro@@ de in the de@@ p@@ ths of the brain in order to mo@@ du@@ late a cir@@ cu@@ it of neurons to impro@@ ve a neuro@@ logical func@@ tion .
It &apos;s really an amazing technology in that it has impro@@ ved the dest@@ in@@ y of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , with se@@ ver@@ e tre@@ mor , with se@@ ver@@ e pa@@ in .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , neuro@@ mo@@ du@@ lation does not mean neuro@@ -@@ re@@ pa@@ ir .
And the dre@@ am of func@@ tional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is to re@@ pa@@ ir the brain .
I think that we are appro@@ ach@@ ing this dre@@ am .
And I would like to show you that we are very clo@@ se to this .
And that with a little bit of help , the brain is able to help it@@ self .
So the story started 15 years ago .
A@@ t that time , I was a chi@@ e@@ f res@@ id@@ ent working days and ni@@ ghts in the emer@@ gen@@ cy room .
I of@@ ten had to take care of patients with head tra@@ u@@ ma .
You have to imagine that when a pati@@ ent comes in with a se@@ ver@@ e head tra@@ u@@ ma , his brain is s@@ w@@ el@@ ling and he &apos;s incre@@ as@@ ing his in@@ tra@@ c@@ ran@@ ial pres@@ sure .
And in order to sa@@ ve his life , you have to de@@ cre@@ ase this in@@ tra@@ c@@ ran@@ ial pres@@ sure .
And to do that , you sometimes have to re@@ move a piece of s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en brain .
So instead of th@@ ro@@ wing away these pi@@ eces of s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en brain , we decided with J@@ e@@ an@@ -@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is B@@ run@@ et , who is a col@@ lea@@ gue of min@@ e , a bio@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , to study them .
What do I mean by that ?
We wanted to grow cells from these pi@@ eces of tis@@ su@@ e .
It &apos;s not an e@@ as@@ y tas@@ k .
G@@ ro@@ wing cells from a piece of tis@@ su@@ e is a bit the same as gro@@ wing very small children out from their family .
So you need to find the right nu@@ tri@@ ents , the war@@ m@@ th , the hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty and all the n@@ ice environ@@ ments to make them th@@ ri@@ ve .
So that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
And after many at@@ temp@@ ts , J@@ e@@ an@@ -@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is did it .
And that &apos;s what he saw under his micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe .
And that was , for us , a ma@@ j@@ or sur@@ pri@@ se .
Why ?
Because this loo@@ ks exactly the same as a ste@@ m cell culture , with lar@@ ge green cells sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding small , im@@ ma@@ ture cells .
And you may remember from bio@@ logy cla@@ ss that ste@@ m cells are im@@ ma@@ ture cells , able to turn into any ty@@ pe of cell of the body .
The adul@@ t brain has ste@@ m cells , but they &apos;re very r@@ are and they &apos;re lo@@ ca@@ ted in de@@ ep and small ni@@ ches in the de@@ p@@ ths of the brain .
And there was another in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing obser@@ va@@ tion : Re@@ gu@@ lar ste@@ m cells are very ac@@ tive cells — cells that divi@@ de , divi@@ de , divi@@ de very qu@@ ick@@ ly .
And they never di@@ e , they &apos;re im@@ mor@@ tal cells .
They divi@@ de s@@ low@@ ly , and after a few wee@@ ks of culture , they even died .
So we were in front of a st@@ ran@@ ge new cell population that looked like ste@@ m cells but beha@@ ved differ@@ ently .
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from .
They come from these cells .
These blue and red cells are called dou@@ b@@ le@@ cor@@ tin@@ -@@ posi@@ tive cells .
All of you have them in your brain .
They repres@@ ent four percent of your cor@@ tical brain cells .
They have a very important ro@@ le dur@@ ing the develo@@ p@@ ment sta@@ ge .
When you were fe@@ t@@ us@@ es , they hel@@ ped your brain to f@@ old it@@ self .
But why do they sta@@ y in your head ?
This , we don &apos;t know .
But it &apos;s not so sure .
But there is one c@@ lear thing — that from these cells , we got our ste@@ m cell culture .
And we were in front of a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al new s@@ our@@ ce of cells to re@@ pa@@ ir the brain .
And we had to pro@@ ve this .
So to pro@@ ve it , we decided to desig@@ n an experi@@ mental par@@ adi@@ g@@ m .
The idea was to bi@@ op@@ s@@ y a piece of brain in a n@@ on-@@ e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ent are@@ a of the brain , and then to culture the cells exactly the way J@@ e@@ an@@ -@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is did it in his lab .
And then la@@ bel them , to put col@@ or in them in order to be able to tra@@ ck them in the brain .
And the last ste@@ p was to re@@ -@@ imp@@ l@@ ant them in the same individu@@ al .
We call these auto@@ lo@@ g@@ ous gra@@ f@@ ts — auto@@ gra@@ f@@ ts .
So the first question we had , &quot; &quot; What will happen if we re@@ -@@ imp@@ l@@ ant these cells in a normal brain , and what will happen if we re@@ -@@ imp@@ l@@ ant the same cells in a l@@ esi@@ on@@ ed brain ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks to the help of profes@@ s@@ or E@@ ri@@ c R@@ ou@@ ill@@ er , we worked with mon@@ ke@@ ys .
So in the fir@@ st@@ -@@ case s@@ cen@@ ario , we re@@ -@@ imp@@ lan@@ ted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they comple@@ tely disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed after a few wee@@ ks , as if they were ta@@ ken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already bus@@ y , they are not nee@@ ded there , so they disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
In the secon@@ d-@@ case s@@ cen@@ ario , we per@@ for@@ med the l@@ esi@@ on , we re@@ -@@ imp@@ lan@@ ted exactly the same cells , and in this case , the cells rema@@ in@@ ed — and they became ma@@ ture neurons .
And that &apos;s the ima@@ ge of what we could obser@@ ve under the micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe .
Th@@ ose are the cells that were re@@ -@@ imp@@ lan@@ ted .
And the pro@@ of they car@@ ry , these little s@@ po@@ ts , those are the cells that we &apos;ve la@@ be@@ led in vi@@ tro , when they were in culture .
But we could not stop here , of course .
D@@ o these cells also help a mon@@ k@@ ey to reco@@ ver after a l@@ esi@@ on ?
So for that , we tra@@ in@@ ed mon@@ ke@@ ys to per@@ form a man@@ u@@ al de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity tas@@ k .
They had to re@@ tri@@ e@@ ve food pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts from a tra@@ y .
They were very good at it .
And when they had re@@ ach@@ ed a pla@@ te@@ a@@ u of per@@ for@@ man@@ ce , we did a l@@ esi@@ on in the mot@@ or cor@@ tex cor@@ respon@@ ding to the hand mo@@ tion .
So the mon@@ ke@@ ys were ple@@ gi@@ c , they could not move their hand any@@ more .
And exactly the same as human@@ s would do , they s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously reco@@ vered to a cer@@ tain ex@@ t@@ ent , exactly the same as after a st@@ ro@@ ke .
P@@ a@@ ti@@ ents are comple@@ tely ple@@ gi@@ c , and then they try to reco@@ ver du@@ e to a brain pla@@ sti@@ city me@@ chan@@ ism , they reco@@ ver to a cer@@ tain ex@@ t@@ ent , exactly the same for the mon@@ k@@ ey .
So when we were sure that the mon@@ k@@ ey had re@@ ach@@ ed his pla@@ te@@ a@@ u of s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous reco@@ very , we imp@@ lan@@ ted his own cells .
So on the left side , you see the mon@@ k@@ ey that has s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously reco@@ vered .
He &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his pre@@ vi@@ ous per@@ for@@ man@@ ce before the l@@ esi@@ on .
And look now when we re@@ -@@ imp@@ l@@ ant the cells : T@@ w@@ o months after re@@ -@@ imp@@ lan@@ tation , the same individu@@ al .
( Applause ) It was also very exci@@ ting resul@@ ts for us , I tell you .
S@@ in@@ ce that time , we &apos;ve underst@@ o@@ od much more about these cells .
We know that we can cr@@ y@@ op@@ res@@ er@@ ve them , we can use them later on .
We know that we can ap@@ p@@ ly them in other neuro@@ path@@ o@@ logical mode@@ ls , like Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , for example .
But our dre@@ am is still to imp@@ l@@ ant them in human@@ s .
And I really hope that I &apos;ll be able to show you so@@ on that the human brain is gi@@ ving us the to@@ ols to re@@ pa@@ ir it@@ self .
Thank you .
( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is amazing , and I &apos;m sure that right now , there are se@@ ver@@ al do@@ z@@ en people in the audi@@ ence , pos@@ si@@ bly even a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , who are thinking , &quot; &quot; I know somebody who can use this . &quot; &quot; I do , in any case .
And of course the question is , what are the bi@@ gg@@ est ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les before you can go into human c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ als ?
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne B@@ lo@@ ch : The bi@@ gg@@ est ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les are regu@@ la@@ tions . ( Lau@@ gh@@ s ) So , from these exci@@ ting resul@@ ts , you need to fi@@ ll out about two ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of pa@@ per@@ s and for@@ ms to be able to go through these kind of tri@@ als .
B@@ G : Wh@@ ich is underst@@ an@@ da@@ ble , the brain is de@@ li@@ cate , et@@ c .
J@@ B : Y@@ es , it is , but it takes a long time and a lot of pati@@ ence and almost a profes@@ sion@@ al te@@ am to do it , you know ?
J@@ B : So , it &apos;s very dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to say .
It depen@@ ds , first , on the appro@@ v@@ al of the tri@@ al .
W@@ ill the regu@@ lation al@@ low us to do it so@@ on ?
And then , you have to per@@ form this kind of study in a small gro@@ up of patients .
So it takes , already , a long time to se@@ lec@@ t the patients , do the tre@@ at@@ ment and e@@ valu@@ ate if it &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful to do this kind of tre@@ at@@ ment .
And then you have to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y this to a mul@@ tic@@ ent@@ ri@@ c tri@@ al .
You have to really pro@@ ve first that it &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful before of@@ fer@@ ing this tre@@ at@@ ment up for every@@ body .
B@@ G : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , th@@ ank you for coming to TED and shar@@ ing this .
D@@ af@@ fo@@ di@@ l H@@ ud@@ son : H@@ el@@ lo ?

This is a work in process , based on some com@@ ments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the stor@@ age of vac@@ c@@ ine .
( Music ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ arra@@ tor : O@@ n this plan@@ et , 1@@ .@@ 6 billion people don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to elec@@ tri@@ city , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation or sto@@ red fu@@ els .
This is a problem .
It impac@@ ts : the s@@ pre@@ ad of disease , the stor@@ age of food and medic@@ ine and the qu@@ ality of life .
So here &apos;s the pla@@ n : in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation that doesn &apos;t use elec@@ tri@@ city , pro@@ pan@@ e , gas , k@@ er@@ o@@ sen@@ e or consu@@ ma@@ bles .
Ti@@ me for some ther@@ mo@@ dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs .
And the story of the Inter@@ mi@@ tt@@ ent A@@ b@@ sor@@ p@@ tion Re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or .
A@@ da@@ m G@@ ro@@ s@@ ser : So 2@@ 9 years ago , I had this ther@@ mo teach@@ er who tal@@ ked about ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion and re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
It &apos;s one of those things that st@@ uc@@ k in my head .
It was a lot like the S@@ ti@@ r@@ ling eng@@ ine : it was co@@ ol , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
And it was in@@ ven@@ ted in 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ 8 , by this guy F@@ er@@ din@@ and Car@@ re , but he coul@@ dn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the to@@ ols of the time .
This cra@@ z@@ y Can@@ adi@@ an na@@ med Po@@ w@@ el C@@ ro@@ s@@ le@@ y com@@ mer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ed this thing called the I@@ cy@@ B@@ all in 19@@ 2@@ 8 , and it was a really ne@@ at idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works .
There &apos;s two s@@ ph@@ er@@ es and they &apos;re separ@@ ated in dist@@ ance .
One has a working f@@ lu@@ id , water and am@@ mon@@ ia , and the other is a con@@ den@@ ser .
You he@@ at up one side , the ho@@ t side .
The am@@ mon@@ ia e@@ va@@ po@@ ra@@ tes and it re@@ -@@ con@@ den@@ ses in the other side .
You let it co@@ ol to room tem@@ per@@ ature , and then , as the am@@ mon@@ ia re@@ -@@ e@@ va@@ po@@ ra@@ tes and com@@ bin@@ es with the water back on the er@@ st@@ while ho@@ t side , it cre@@ ates a power@@ ful co@@ ol@@ ing effec@@ t .
So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it b@@ le@@ w up .
Because using am@@ mon@@ ia you get hu@@ ge@@ ly high pres@@ sur@@ es if you he@@ ated them wrong .
It to@@ p@@ ped 4@@ 00 p@@ si . The am@@ mon@@ ia was to@@ xi@@ c . It sp@@ ra@@ y@@ ed every@@ where .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , the great thing about 200@@ 6 is there &apos;s a lot of really great compu@@ ta@@ tional work you can do .
So , we got the whole ther@@ mo@@ dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs de@@ par@@ t@@ ment at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d invol@@ ved — a lot of compu@@ ta@@ tional f@@ lu@@ id dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs .
We pro@@ ved that most of the am@@ mon@@ ia re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation ta@@ bles are wrong .
We found some n@@ on-@@ to@@ xi@@ c re@@ fri@@ ger@@ an@@ ts that worked at very low va@@ por pres@@ sur@@ es .
B@@ rou@@ ght in a te@@ am from the U.@@ K@@ . — there &apos;s a lot of great re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation people , it tur@@ ned out , in the U.@@ K@@ . — and buil@@ t a test ri@@ g , and pro@@ ved that , in fact , we could make a low pres@@ sure , n@@ on-@@ to@@ xi@@ c re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a co@@ o@@ king fire .
Mo@@ st people have co@@ o@@ king fir@@ es in the world , whether it &apos;s ca@@ me@@ l d@@ un@@ g or wo@@ od .
It he@@ at@@ s up for about 30 minu@@ tes , co@@ ols for an h@@ our .
P@@ ut it into a con@@ tain@@ er and it will re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ate for 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s .
It loo@@ ks like this . This is the fi@@ f@@ th pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe . It &apos;s not quite done .
W@@ ei@@ gh@@ s about ei@@ ght po@@ unds , and this is the way it works .
You put it into a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ li@@ ter v@@ es@@ se@@ l , about three gal@@ lon@@ s , and it &apos;ll co@@ ol it down to just ab@@ o@@ ve f@@ ree@@ zing — three de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ o@@ ve f@@ ree@@ zing — for 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s in a 30 de@@ gre@@ e C environment . It &apos;s really che@@ a@@ p .
We think we can build these in high volu@@ mes for about 25 dollars , in low volu@@ mes for about 40 dollars .
And we think we can make re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation something that every@@ body can have .
Thank you .

So my name is Ta@@ y@@ l@@ or W@@ il@@ son .
I am 1@@ 7 years old and I am a nuc@@ lear physi@@ ci@@ st , which may be a little hard to believe , but I am .
And I would like to make the case that nuc@@ lear fu@@ sion will be that point , that the bri@@ dge that T@@ . Bo@@ one P@@ ick@@ ens tal@@ ked about will get us to .
So nuc@@ lear fu@@ sion is our energy future .
And the second point , making the case that kids can really change the world .
So you may ask — ( Applause ) You may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
Well I buil@@ t a fu@@ sion reac@@ tor when I was 1@@ 4 years old .
That is the inside of my nuc@@ lear fu@@ sion reac@@ tor .
I started buil@@ ding this project when I was about 12 or 1@@ 3 years old .
I decided I wanted to make a s@@ tar .
Now most of you are probably saying , well there &apos;s no such thing as nuc@@ lear fu@@ sion .
I don &apos;t see any nuc@@ lear power plan@@ ts with fu@@ sion energy .
Well it doesn &apos;t bre@@ ak even .
It doesn &apos;t produ@@ ce more energy out than I put in , but it still does some pretty co@@ ol stuff .
And I as@@ se@@ mb@@ led this in my gar@@ age , and it now lives in the physi@@ cs de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of Ne@@ va@@ da , R@@ en@@ o .
And it s@@ la@@ ms together de@@ u@@ teri@@ um , which is just hy@@ dro@@ gen with an ex@@ tra neu@@ tr@@ on in it .
So this is similar to the reac@@ tion of the pr@@ ot@@ on cha@@ in that &apos;s going on inside the S@@ un .
And I &apos;m s@@ la@@ mm@@ ing it together so hard that that hy@@ dro@@ gen f@@ us@@ es together , and in the process it has some b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts , and I utili@@ ze those b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts .
So this pre@@ vi@@ ous year , I w@@ on the In@@ te@@ l Inter@@ national S@@ ci@@ ence and En@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing F@@ air .
I developed a detec@@ tor that re@@ places the cur@@ r@@ ent detec@@ tors that Ho@@ me@@ land S@@ ec@@ u@@ ri@@ ty has .
For hundre@@ ds of dollars , I &apos;ve developed a system that ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the sen@@ si@@ tivi@@ ty of detec@@ tors that are hundre@@ ds of thousands of dollars .
I buil@@ t this in my gar@@ age .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ve developed a system to produ@@ ce medical is@@ ot@@ op@@ es .
In@@ stead of re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing multi@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar faci@@ li@@ ties I &apos;ve developed a devi@@ ce that , on a very small s@@ cal@@ e , can produ@@ ce these is@@ ot@@ op@@ es .
So that &apos;s my fu@@ sion reac@@ tor in the bac@@ k@@ ground there .
That is me at the control pan@@ el of my fu@@ sion reac@@ tor .
Oh , by the way , I make y@@ el@@ low@@ ca@@ ke in my gar@@ age , so my nuc@@ lear progra@@ m is as ad@@ van@@ ced as the I@@ ran@@ i@@ ans .
So maybe I don &apos;t want to ad@@ mi@@ t to that .
This is me at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ e@@ va , S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , which is the pre@@ e@@ min@@ ent partic@@ le physi@@ cs labor@@ at@@ ory in the world .
And this is me with P@@ res@@ id@@ ent O@@ ba@@ ma , sho@@ wing him my Ho@@ me@@ land S@@ ec@@ u@@ ri@@ ty research .
( Applause ) So in about se@@ ven years of doing nuc@@ lear research , I started out with a dre@@ am to make a &quot; &quot; s@@ tar in a j@@ ar , &quot; &quot; a s@@ tar in my gar@@ age , and I en@@ ded up me@@ e@@ ting the pres@@ id@@ ent and develo@@ ping things that I think can change the world , and I think other kids can too .
So th@@ ank you very much .

So this is just one experi@@ ment that we publi@@ sh@@ ed a few years ago , where a mon@@ k@@ ey , without mo@@ ving its body , learned to control the mo@@ ve@@ ments of an a@@ va@@ tar ar@@ m , a virtual ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t exis@@ t .
So what we pro@@ pos@@ ed was , let &apos;s create a new body .
And he just got it right , and now he star@@ ts wal@@ king .
They have to move an ar@@ m in three di@@ men@@ si@@ ons .
It &apos;s simply im@@ possible .
The second sub@@ ject rece@@ i@@ ved a ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic pul@@ se in the visual cor@@ tex , or a different pul@@ se , two different pul@@ ses .
Mo@@ der@@ at@@ or : W@@ ow . Okay , that &apos;s where we are going .
A few years ago , I got one of those s@@ pa@@ m e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
And it man@@ ag@@ ed to get through my s@@ pa@@ m fil@@ ter .
I &apos;m not quite sure how , but it tur@@ ned up in my in@@ bo@@ x , and it was from a guy called So@@ lo@@ mon O@@ don@@ k@@ oh .
It went like this : it said , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ lo J@@ a@@ mes V@@ e@@ it@@ ch , I have an interesting bus@@ in@@ ess pro@@ pos@@ al I want to share with you , So@@ lo@@ mon . &quot; &quot; Now , my hand was kind of ho@@ ver@@ ing on the de@@ le@@ te bu@@ tt@@ on , right ?
I was looking at my ph@@ one . I thought , I could just de@@ le@@ te this .
O@@ r I could do what I think we &apos;ve all always wanted to do .
He said , &quot; &quot; De@@ ar J@@ a@@ mes V@@ e@@ it@@ ch , We sh@@ all be shi@@ p@@ ping G@@ old to you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You will ear@@ n 10 % of any g@@ old you dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tes . &quot; ( Laughter )
So I knew I was de@@ al@@ ing with a profes@@ sion@@ al . ( Laughter )
I said , &quot; &quot; How much is it wor@@ th ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; We will start with s@@ mal@@ ler qu@@ anti@@ ty , &quot; &quot; — I was like , aw@@ w — and then he said , &quot; &quot; of 25 k@@ gs . ( Laughter )
The wor@@ th should be about $ 2@@ .@@ 5 million . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; So@@ lo@@ mon , if we &apos;re going to do it , let &apos;s go big .
There &apos;s no point doing this at all un@@ less you &apos;re shi@@ p@@ ping at le@@ ast a me@@ tri@@ c ton . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) He said , &quot; &quot; What do you do for a living ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a he@@ dge f@@ und ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive b@@ ank man@@ ag@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This isn &apos;t the first time I &apos;ve shi@@ p@@ ped bul@@ li@@ on , my fri@@ end , no no no .
Then I started to p@@ ani@@ c .
I was like , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere are you based ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know about you , but I think if we &apos;re going vi@@ a the pos@@ tal ser@@ vi@@ ce , it ou@@ ght to be si@@ g@@ ned for .
That &apos;s a lot of g@@ old . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It will not be e@@ as@@ y to con@@ vin@@ ce my comp@@ any to do lar@@ ger qu@@ anti@@ ty shi@@ p@@ ment . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; So@@ lo@@ mon , I &apos;m comple@@ tely with you on this one .
I &apos;m pu@@ tting together a visual for you to take into the bo@@ ard me@@ e@@ ting .
H@@ old ti@@ ght . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is what I s@@ ent So@@ lo@@ mon . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I don &apos;t know if we have any sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans in the house , but there &apos;s defini@@ tely something going on . ( Laughter )
I said , &quot; &quot; So@@ lo@@ mon , at@@ ta@@ ched to this e@@ mai@@ l you &apos;ll find a hel@@ p@@ ful char@@ t .
I &apos;ve had one of my as@@ si@@ stan@@ ts r@@ un the nu@@ mb@@ ers .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re ready for shi@@ p@@ ping as much g@@ old as possible . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s always a moment where they try to tu@@ g your hear@@ t@@ str@@ ings , and this was it for So@@ lo@@ mon .
I was in Sa@@ in@@ s@@ bur@@ y &apos;s the other day and there were like 30 different vari@@ e@@ ties .
Al@@ so you can c@@ ut up car@@ r@@ ots , and you can di@@ p them .
Ha@@ ve you ever done that , So@@ lo@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I have to go bed now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; T@@ ill mor@@ row .
Ha@@ ve s@@ we@@ et dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know what to say !
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; So@@ lo@@ mon , I sp@@ ent all ni@@ ght coming up with this co@@ de we need to use in all f@@ ur@@ ther cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce : L@@ aw@@ y@@ er : Gu@@ m@@ my Be@@ ar .
B@@ ank : Cre@@ am E@@ g@@ g .
Le@@ g@@ al : F@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ y C@@ ol@@ a B@@ ot@@ t@@ le . C@@ la@@ i@@ m : Pe@@ an@@ ut M &@@ amp@@ ; M@@ s@@ .
D@@ ocu@@ ments : J@@ el@@ ly Be@@ ans .
I &apos;ve g@@ one too far . So I had to bac@@ k@@ pe@@ da@@ l a little .
I said , &quot; &quot; So@@ lo@@ mon , I@@ s the de@@ al still on ?
K@@ it@@ K@@ at . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because you have to be consi@@ st@@ ent .
Then I did get an e@@ mai@@ l back from him .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m not jo@@ king , this is what tur@@ ned up in my in@@ bo@@ x .
This was a good day .
&quot; &quot; The bus@@ in@@ ess is on .
I am trying to rai@@ se the bal@@ ance for the Gu@@ m@@ my Be@@ ar — ( Laughter ) so he can sub@@ mi@@ t all the nee@@ ded F@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ y C@@ ol@@ a B@@ ot@@ t@@ le J@@ el@@ ly Be@@ ans to the Cre@@ me E@@ g@@ g , for the Pe@@ an@@ ut M &@@ amp@@ ; M@@ s process to start . ( Laughter )
S@@ end 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 po@@ unds vi@@ a a Gi@@ ant Gu@@ m@@ my Li@@ z@@ ard . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And that was so much f@@ un , right , that it got me thinking : like , what would happen if I just sp@@ ent as much time as could re@@ pl@@ ying to as many s@@ ca@@ m e@@ ma@@ il@@ s as I could ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for three years on your be@@ half .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ raz@@ y stuff happens when you start re@@ pl@@ ying to s@@ ca@@ m e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
It &apos;s really dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t , and I high@@ ly re@@ com@@ men@@ d we do it .
I don &apos;t think what I &apos;m doing is mean .
There are a lot of people who do mean things to s@@ ca@@ mm@@ ers .
All I &apos;m doing is wa@@ st@@ ing their time .
And I think any time they &apos;re s@@ pen@@ ding with me is time they &apos;re not s@@ pen@@ ding s@@ ca@@ mm@@ ing vulner@@ able adul@@ ts out of their sa@@ v@@ ings , right ?
And if you &apos;re going to do this — and I high@@ ly re@@ com@@ men@@ d you do — get yourself a p@@ se@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ mous e@@ mai@@ l ad@@ d@@ ress .
D@@ on &apos;t use your own e@@ mai@@ l ad@@ d@@ ress .
That &apos;s what I was doing at the start and it was a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are .
But I &apos;ll tell you what , though , gu@@ ys , I &apos;ll tell you what : any day is a good day , any day is a good day if you rece@@ i@@ ve an e@@ mai@@ l that beg@@ ins like this : ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I A@@ M W@@ I@@ N@@ N@@ I@@ E M@@ A@@ N@@ D@@ E@@ L@@ A , T@@ H@@ E S@@ E@@ C@@ O@@ N@@ D W@@ I@@ F@@ E O@@ F N@@ E@@ L@@ S@@ O@@ N M@@ A@@ N@@ D@@ E@@ L@@ A T@@ H@@ E FO@@ R@@ M@@ E@@ R S@@ O@@ U@@ T@@ H A@@ F@@ R@@ I@@ C@@ A@@ N P@@ R@@ E@@ S@@ I@@ D@@ E@@ N@@ T . &quot; &quot; I was like , oh ! — that W@@ in@@ ni@@ e Man@@ dela .

I remember one of the first times we were looking at col@@ la@@ gen .
And your entire body , everything — your ha@@ ir , sk@@ in , b@@ one , na@@ il@@ s — everything is made of col@@ la@@ gen .
And it &apos;s a kind of ro@@ pe@@ -@@ like struc@@ ture that tw@@ ir@@ ls and s@@ w@@ ir@@ ls like this .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five wee@@ ks , you start to see the early at@@ ri@@ um and the early v@@ ent@@ ri@@ c@@ les .
It &apos;s a my@@ ster@@ y , it &apos;s ma@@ gi@@ c , it &apos;s di@@ vin@@ ity .
Ta@@ ke a look at this little tu@@ ft of ca@@ pi@@ ll@@ ari@@ es .
I &apos;m M@@ c@@ K@@ en@@ na P@@ op@@ e . I &apos;m 1@@ 4 years old , and when I was 1@@ 3 , I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed one of the lar@@ g@@ est to@@ y comp@@ ani@@ es , to@@ y@@ ma@@ kers , in the world , H@@ as@@ bro , to change the way that they mar@@ ke@@ ted one of their most b@@ est@@ -@@ se@@ lling produc@@ ts .
So al@@ low me to tell you about it .
So I have a bro@@ ther , G@@ av@@ in .
When this whole s@@ he@@ ban@@ g happened , he was four .
He lo@@ ved to co@@ ok .
He was always getting ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents out of the fri@@ dge and mi@@ x@@ ing them into these , nee@@ d@@ less to say , un@@ e@@ a@@ table con@@ co@@ c@@ tions , or making invi@@ sible mac@@ ar@@ on@@ i and che@@ ese .
He wanted to be a che@@ f really b@@ ad@@ ly .
And so what better gi@@ ft for a kid who wanted to be a che@@ f than an E@@ as@@ y@@ -@@ B@@ a@@ ke O@@ ven . R@@ ight ?
I mean , we all had those when we were little .
And he wanted one so b@@ ad@@ ly .
But then he started to realiz@@ e something .
In the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als , and on the bo@@ xes for the E@@ as@@ y@@ -@@ B@@ a@@ ke O@@ ven@@ s , H@@ as@@ bro mar@@ ke@@ ted them speci@@ fi@@ cally to gir@@ ls .
And the way that they did this was they would only fe@@ ature gir@@ ls on the bo@@ xes or in the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als , and there would be flo@@ wer@@ y pr@@ in@@ ts all over the o@@ ven@@ s and it would be in b@@ right p@@ in@@ k and pur@@ ple , very gen@@ der@@ -@@ speci@@ fic col@@ ors to fe@@ mal@@ es , right ?
So it kind of was sen@@ ding a mes@@ sa@@ ge that only gir@@ ls are sup@@ pos@@ ed to co@@ ok ; bo@@ ys ar@@ en &apos;t .
And this dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged my bro@@ ther a lot .
He thought that he was@@ n &apos;t sup@@ pos@@ ed to want to be a che@@ f , because that was something that gir@@ ls did .
G@@ ir@@ ls co@@ o@@ ked ; bo@@ ys didn &apos;t , or so was the mes@@ sa@@ ge that H@@ as@@ bro was sen@@ ding .
And this got me thinking , God , I wis@@ h there was a way that I could change this , that could I have my vo@@ ice heard by H@@ as@@ bro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it .
And that got me thinking about a we@@ b@@ si@@ te that I had learned about a few months pri@@ or called Ch@@ an@@ ge@@ .@@ org@@ .
Ch@@ an@@ ge@@ .@@ or@@ g is an on@@ line peti@@ tion@@ -@@ shar@@ ing pla@@ t@@ form where you can create a peti@@ tion and share it across all of these social media ne@@ t@@ works , through F@@ ace@@ book , through T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , through Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be , through Re@@ d@@ di@@ t , through T@@ u@@ mb@@ l@@ r , through w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you can think of .
And so I cre@@ ated a peti@@ tion al@@ ong with the Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be video that I ad@@ ded to the peti@@ tion basi@@ cally as@@ king H@@ as@@ bro to change the way that they mar@@ ke@@ ted it , in fe@@ atur@@ ing bo@@ ys in the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als , on the bo@@ xes , and most of all cre@@ ating them in less gen@@ der@@ -@@ speci@@ fic col@@ ors .
So this peti@@ tion started to take off — hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ously f@@ ast , you have no idea .
I was getting inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed by all these national news out@@ le@@ ts and pres@@ s out@@ le@@ ts , and it was amazing .
In three wee@@ ks , maybe three and a half , I had 4@@ 6@@ ,000 si@@ gn@@ atur@@ es on this peti@@ tion .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So , nee@@ d@@ less to say , it was cra@@ z@@ y .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ ally , H@@ as@@ bro themselves invi@@ ted me to their he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters so they could go and un@@ ve@@ il their new E@@ as@@ y@@ -@@ B@@ a@@ ke O@@ ven produc@@ t to me in black , si@@ l@@ ver and blue .
It was liter@@ ally one of the best mo@@ ments of my life .
It was like &quot; &quot; W@@ il@@ ly W@@ on@@ k@@ a and the C@@ ho@@ co@@ late F@@ ac@@ t@@ ory . &quot; &quot; That thing was amazing .
What I didn &apos;t realiz@@ e at the time , ho@@ we@@ ver , was that I had become an activi@@ st , I could change something , that even as a kid , or maybe even especi@@ ally as a kid , my vo@@ ice ma@@ tter@@ ed , and your vo@@ ice ma@@ t@@ ters too .
I want to let you know it &apos;s not going to be e@@ as@@ y , and it was@@ n &apos;t e@@ as@@ y for me , because I fac@@ ed a lot of ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les .
People on@@ line , and sometimes even in real life , were dis@@ res@@ pec@@ t@@ ful to me and my family , and tal@@ ked about how the whole thing was a was@@ te of time , and it really dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged me .
And actually , I have some examp@@ les , because what &apos;s better re@@ ven@@ ge than dis@@ pla@@ ying their i@@ di@@ o@@ cy ?
So , let &apos;s see .
F@@ ro@@ m us@@ er name Li@@ qui@@ d@@ so@@ re@@ 2@@ 9 — interesting us@@ er na@@ mes we have here — &quot; D@@ is@@ gu@@ st@@ ing liber@@ al mo@@ ms making their s@@ ons ga@@ y . &quot;
Li@@ qui@@ d@@ so@@ re@@ 2@@ 9 , really ? Re@@ ally ? Okay .
How about from W@@ hi@@ te@@ bo@@ y@@ 7@@ 7@@ A@@ G@@ S : &quot; People always need something to ( fe@@ mal@@ e do@@ g ) about . &quot;
F@@ ro@@ m J@@ ef@@ f@@ re@@ y Gu@@ ti@@ er@@ re@@ z : &quot; O@@ M@@ G , sh@@ ut up . You just want money and attention . &quot;
So it was com@@ ments like these that really dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged me from wan@@ ting to make change in the future because I thought , people don &apos;t care , people think it &apos;s a was@@ te of time , and people are going to be dis@@ res@@ pec@@ t@@ ful to me and my family .
It h@@ ur@@ t me , and it made me think , what &apos;s the point of making change in the future ?
But then I started to realiz@@ e something .
Ha@@ ters g@@ on@@ na ha@@ te .
Co@@ me on , say it with me . One , two , three : Ha@@ ters g@@ on@@ na ha@@ te .
So let your ha@@ ters ha@@ te , you know what , and make your change , because I know you can .
I look out into this cro@@ w@@ d , and I see 4@@ 00 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change , and I know that you can , and all of you wat@@ ching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in , and you can tra@@ de it across all these social media , through F@@ ace@@ book , through T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , through Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be , through Re@@ d@@ di@@ t , through T@@ u@@ mb@@ l@@ r , through w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver else you can think of .
And you can make that change .
You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it .
And that s@@ par@@ k that you &apos;ve been hear@@ ing about all day today , you can use that s@@ par@@ k that you have within you and turn it into a fire .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So ye@@ ah , I &apos;m a ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per carto@@ on@@ ist — poli@@ tical carto@@ on@@ ist .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it — ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s ?
It &apos;s a sort of pa@@ per@@ -@@ based read@@ er .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s li@@ ghter than an i@@ P@@ ad , it &apos;s a bit che@@ ap@@ er .
You know what they say ?
They say the pr@@ int media is d@@ ying — who says that ? Well , the media .
But this is no news , right ?
You &apos;ve read about it already .
( Laughter ) L@@ adi@@ es and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , the world has g@@ ot@@ ten s@@ mal@@ ler .
I know it &apos;s a cli@@ che , but look , look how small , how tin@@ y it has g@@ ot@@ ten .
And you know the reason why , of course .
This is because of technology — ye@@ ah .
( Laughter ) An@@ y computer desig@@ n@@ ers in the room ?
Y@@ e@@ ah well , you gu@@ ys are making my life mi@@ ser@@ able because tra@@ ck pa@@ ds used to be ro@@ und , a n@@ ice ro@@ und s@@ hap@@ e .
That makes a good carto@@ on .
But what are you going to do with a fl@@ at tra@@ ck pa@@ d , those s@@ qu@@ are things ?
There &apos;s nothing I can do as a carto@@ on@@ ist .
Well , I know the world is fl@@ at now .
That &apos;s true .
And the Internet has re@@ ach@@ ed every cor@@ ner of the world , the po@@ or@@ est , the re@@ mot@@ est places .
E@@ very vi@@ l@@ la@@ ge in Africa now has a cy@@ b@@ er ca@@ fe .
( Laughter ) D@@ on &apos;t go as@@ king for a F@@ rap@@ p@@ uc@@ cin@@ o there .
So we are bri@@ d@@ ging the di@@ gi@@ tal divi@@ de .
The Th@@ ird W@@ or@@ ld is connec@@ ted , we are connec@@ ted .
And what happens next ?
Well , you &apos;ve got mai@@ l .
Y@@ e@@ ah .
Well , the Internet has em@@ power@@ ed us .
It has em@@ power@@ ed you , it has em@@ power@@ ed me and it has em@@ power@@ ed some other gu@@ ys as well .
( Laughter ) You know , these last two carto@@ ons — I did them live dur@@ ing a con@@ fer@@ ence in H@@ an@@ o@@ i .
And they were not used to that in commun@@ ist 2@@ .@@ 0 Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m .
( Laughter ) So I was carto@@ on@@ ing live on a wi@@ de s@@ cre@@ en — it was quite a sen@@ sa@@ tion — and then this guy came to me .
He was taking pic@@ tures of me and of my s@@ ke@@ t@@ ches , and I thought , &quot; &quot; This is great , a Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m@@ ese fan . &quot; &quot; And as he came the second day , I thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really a carto@@ on lo@@ ver . &quot; &quot; And on the th@@ ird day , I finally underst@@ o@@ od , the guy was actually on du@@ ty .
So by now , there must be a hundre@@ d pic@@ tures of me s@@ mi@@ ling with my s@@ ke@@ t@@ ches in the fi@@ les of the Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m@@ ese poli@@ ce .
( Laughter ) No , but it &apos;s true : the Internet has chan@@ ged the world .
It has ro@@ c@@ ked the music indu@@ stry ; it has chan@@ ged the way we consu@@ me music .
For those of you old enough to remember , we used to have to go to the st@@ ore to ste@@ al it .
( Laughter ) And it has chan@@ ged the way your future emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er will look at your ap@@ pli@@ cation .
So be car@@ e@@ ful with that F@@ ace@@ book ac@@ coun@@ t — your mo@@ m@@ ma told you , be car@@ e@@ ful .
And technology has set us f@@ ree — this is f@@ ree W@@ i@@ F@@ i .
But ye@@ ah , it has liber@@ ated us from the of@@ fi@@ ce des@@ k .
This is your life , en@@ jo@@ y it .
( Laughter ) In sh@@ or@@ t , technology , the inter@@ net , they have chan@@ ged our li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
T@@ ec@@ h gur@@ u , like this man — that a G@@ er@@ man ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine called the phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er of the 2@@ 1@@ st cent@@ ur@@ y — they are s@@ hap@@ ing the way we do things .
They are s@@ hap@@ ing the way we consu@@ me .
They are s@@ hap@@ ing our very des@@ ir@@ es .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You will not like it .
And technology has even chan@@ ged our rela@@ tion@@ ship to God .
( Laughter ) Now I sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t get into this .
Re@@ li@@ gi@@ on and poli@@ tical carto@@ ons , as you may have heard , make a dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t cou@@ ple , ever sin@@ ce that day of 200@@ 5 , when a bun@@ ch of carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k dre@@ w carto@@ ons that had re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons all over the world — de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions , f@@ at@@ w@@ a , they provo@@ ked viol@@ ence . People died in the viol@@ ence .
This was so si@@ c@@ k@@ en@@ ing ; people died because of carto@@ ons .
I mean — I had the fe@@ el@@ ing at the time that carto@@ ons had been used by both si@@ des , actually .
They were used first by a D@@ an@@ is@@ h ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per , which wanted to make a point on Is@@ la@@ m .
A D@@ an@@ is@@ h carto@@ on@@ ist told me he was one of the 2@@ 4 who rece@@ i@@ ved the as@@ si@@ gn@@ ment to dra@@ w the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t — 12 of them re@@ fu@@ sed . D@@ id you know that ?
He told me , &quot; &quot; No@@ body has to tell me what I should dra@@ w .
This is not how it works . &quot; &quot; And then , of course , they were used by extre@@ mi@@ sts and poli@@ tici@@ ans on the other side .
They wanted to sti@@ r up contro@@ ver@@ s@@ y .
You know the story .
We know that carto@@ ons can be used as we@@ a@@ po@@ ns .
H@@ ist@@ ory te@@ lls us , they &apos;ve been used by the Na@@ z@@ is to at@@ ta@@ ck the J@@ e@@ ws .
And here we are now .
In the Uni@@ ted Na@@ tions , half of the world is p@@ us@@ hing to pen@@ aliz@@ e the of@@ fen@@ se to reli@@ gi@@ on — they call it the de@@ fa@@ ma@@ tion of reli@@ gi@@ on — while the other half of the world is fi@@ gh@@ ting back in defen@@ se of f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h .
So the cla@@ sh of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations is here , and carto@@ ons are at the mi@@ d@@ dle of it ?
This got me thinking .
Now you see me thinking at my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en table , and sin@@ ce you &apos;re in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , ple@@ ase me@@ et my wi@@ fe .
( Laughter ) In 200@@ 6 , a few months after , I went I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast — W@@ est@@ er@@ n Africa .
Now , talk of a divi@@ ded place — the country was c@@ ut in two .
You had a re@@ be@@ llion in the Nor@@ th , the government in the S@@ outh — the ca@@ pi@@ tal , A@@ bi@@ d@@ j@@ an — and in the mi@@ d@@ dle , the F@@ ren@@ ch ar@@ my .
This loo@@ ks like a gi@@ ant ha@@ mb@@ ur@@ ger .
You don &apos;t want to be the ha@@ m in the mi@@ d@@ dle .
I was there to re@@ port on that story in carto@@ ons .
I &apos;ve been doing this for the last 15 years ; it &apos;s my side job , if you want .
So you see the st@@ y@@ le is different .
This is more seri@@ ous than maybe edi@@ tori@@ al carto@@ on@@ ing .
I went to places like G@@ a@@ za dur@@ ing the w@@ ar in 200@@ 9 .
So this is really j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ism in carto@@ ons .
You &apos;ll he@@ ar more and more about it .
This is the future of j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ism , I think .
And of course , I went to see the re@@ be@@ ls in the nor@@ th .
Th@@ ose were po@@ or gu@@ ys fi@@ gh@@ ting for their ri@@ ghts .
There was an e@@ th@@ ni@@ c side to this con@@ fli@@ c@@ t as very of@@ ten in Africa .
And I went to see the D@@ o@@ zo .
The D@@ o@@ zo , they are the tradi@@ tional hun@@ ters of W@@ est Africa .
People fe@@ ar them — they help the re@@ be@@ llion a lot .
They are belie@@ ved to have ma@@ gi@@ cal po@@ w@@ ers .
They can disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar and es@@ ca@@ pe bul@@ le@@ ts .
I went to see a D@@ o@@ zo chi@@ e@@ f ; he told me about his ma@@ gi@@ cal po@@ w@@ ers .
He said , &quot; &quot; I can cho@@ p your head off right away and br@@ ing you back to life . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe we don &apos;t have time for this right now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; A@@ no@@ ther time . &quot;
So back in A@@ bi@@ d@@ j@@ an , I was given a chan@@ ce to le@@ ad a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p with lo@@ cal carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s there and I thought , y@@ es , in a con@@ text like this , carto@@ ons can really be used as we@@ a@@ po@@ ns aga@@ in@@ st the other side .
I mean , the pres@@ s in I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast was b@@ it@@ ter@@ ly divi@@ ded — it was compar@@ ed to the media in R@@ wan@@ da before the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de — so imagine .
And what can a carto@@ on@@ ist do ?
So@@ me@@ times edi@@ tors would tell their carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s to dra@@ w what they wanted to see , and the guy has to fe@@ ed his family , right ?
So the idea was pretty simple .
We b@@ rou@@ ght together carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s from all si@@ des in I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast .
We took them away from their ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per for three days .
And I asked them to do a project together , tac@@ k@@ le the is@@ su@@ es af@@ fec@@ ting their country in carto@@ ons , y@@ es , in carto@@ ons .
S@@ how the posi@@ tive power of carto@@ ons .
It &apos;s a great to@@ ol of communi@@ cation for bad or for good .
And carto@@ ons can cro@@ ss bo@@ und@@ ari@@ es , as you have seen .
And hu@@ mor is a good way , I think , to ad@@ d@@ ress seri@@ ous is@@ su@@ es .
And I &apos;m very pro@@ u@@ d of what they did .
I mean , they didn &apos;t ag@@ ree with each other — that was not the point .
And I didn &apos;t ask them to do n@@ ice carto@@ ons .
The first day , they were even sh@@ ou@@ ting at each other .
But they came up with a book , looking back at 1@@ 3 years of poli@@ tical cri@@ sis in I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast .
So the idea was there .
And I &apos;ve been doing pro@@ jects like this , in 200@@ 9 in Le@@ ban@@ on , this year in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , back in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
In Le@@ ban@@ on , it was not a book .
The idea was to have — the same princi@@ p@@ al , a divi@@ ded country — take carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s from all si@@ des and let them do something together .
So in Le@@ ban@@ on , we en@@ ro@@ l@@ led the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per edi@@ tors , and we got them to publi@@ sh ei@@ ght carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s from all si@@ des all together on the same pa@@ ge , ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the is@@ su@@ e af@@ fec@@ ting Le@@ ban@@ on , like reli@@ gi@@ on in poli@@ tics and every@@ day life .
And it worked .
For three days , almost all the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s of Be@@ ir@@ ut publi@@ sh@@ ed all those carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s together — anti@@ -@@ government , pro@@ -@@ government , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an , M@@ us@@ li@@ m , of course , Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ spe@@ a@@ king , well , you name it .
So this was a great project .
And then in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , what we did was ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the is@@ su@@ e of e@@ th@@ ni@@ city , which is a po@@ is@@ on in a lot of places in Africa .
And we did video cli@@ ps — you can see them if you go to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be / K@@ en@@ y@@ ato@@ ons .
So , pre@@ ach@@ ing for f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h is e@@ as@@ y here , but as you have seen in con@@ tex@@ ts of repres@@ sion or divi@@ sion , again , what can a carto@@ on@@ ist do ?
He has to keep his job .
Well I believe that in any con@@ text any@@ where , he always has the cho@@ ice at le@@ ast not to do a carto@@ on that will fe@@ ed ha@@ tre@@ d .
And that &apos;s the mes@@ sa@@ ge I try to con@@ ve@@ y to them .
I think we all always have the cho@@ ice in the end not to do the bad thing .
But we need to sup@@ port these &#91; un@@ c@@ lear &#93; , cri@@ tical and respon@@ sible vo@@ ic@@ es in Africa , in Le@@ ban@@ on , in your lo@@ cal ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per , in the Ap@@ ple st@@ ore .
To@@ day , te@@ ch comp@@ ani@@ es are the world &apos;s lar@@ g@@ est edi@@ tors .
They deci@@ de what is too of@@ fen@@ sive or too provo@@ ca@@ tive for you to see .
So really , it &apos;s not about the f@@ ree@@ dom of carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s ; it &apos;s about your f@@ ree@@ do@@ ms .
And for dic@@ ta@@ tors all over the world , the good news is when carto@@ on@@ ist@@ s , j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts and activi@@ sts sh@@ ut up .
Thank you .
( Applause )
They did .
In the same year , we were ready .
That would be a ga@@ me@@ -@@ chan@@ ging technology , right ?
But in fact , we already pos@@ s@@ ess this devi@@ ce , and it &apos;s called human communi@@ cation system and effec@@ tive stor@@ y@@ telling .
To understand how this devi@@ ce works , we have to look into our bra@@ ins .
And we have to for@@ mu@@ late the question in a sli@@ gh@@ tly different man@@ ner .
Now we have to ask how these ne@@ ur@@ on pa@@ tter@@ ns in my brain that are as@@ soci@@ ated with my memor@@ ies and ideas are transmi@@ t@@ ted into your bra@@ ins .
And we think there are two fac@@ tors that en@@ able us to communi@@ cate .
F@@ ir@@ st , your brain is now physi@@ cally cou@@ p@@ led to the sound wa@@ ve that I &apos;m transmi@@ tting to your brain .
And second , we developed a common neu@@ ral pr@@ ot@@ o@@ co@@ l that en@@ ab@@ led us to communi@@ cate .
So how do we know that ?
In my lab in P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ ton , we br@@ ing people to the f@@ M@@ R@@ I s@@ can@@ ner and we s@@ can their bra@@ ins while they are ei@@ ther telling or listen@@ ing to re@@ al@@ -@@ life stories .
And to give you a sense of the sti@@ mul@@ us we are using , let me play 20 secon@@ ds from a story that we used , told by a very tal@@ en@@ ted stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ er , J@@ i@@ m O &apos;@@ Gra@@ dy .
( Au@@ dio ) J@@ i@@ m O &apos;@@ Gra@@ dy : So I &apos;m ban@@ ging out my story and I know it &apos;s good , and then I start to make it better — ( Laughter ) by ad@@ ding an ele@@ ment of em@@ be@@ lli@@ sh@@ ment .
Re@@ por@@ ters call this &quot; &quot; making sh@@ it up . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they re@@ com@@ men@@ d aga@@ in@@ st cro@@ s@@ sing that line .
But I had just seen the line cro@@ s@@ sed between a high@@ -@@ power@@ ed de@@ an and as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t with a pa@@ stry .
And I kin@@ da li@@ ked it . &quot; &quot; U@@ r@@ i H@@ as@@ son : O@@ K , so now let &apos;s look into your brain and see what &apos;s happen@@ ing when you li@@ ste@@ n to these kinds of stories .
And let &apos;s start simple — let &apos;s start with one listen@@ er and one brain are@@ a : the audi@@ t@@ ory cor@@ tex that pro@@ ces@@ ses the so@@ unds that come from the e@@ ar .
And as you can see , in this particular brain are@@ a , the respon@@ ses are going up and down as the story is un@@ fol@@ ding .
And we can ask : How similar are the respon@@ ses across all listen@@ ers ?
So here you can see five listen@@ ers .
And we start to s@@ can their bra@@ ins before the story star@@ ts , when they &apos;re simply l@@ ying in the dar@@ k and wa@@ it@@ ing for the story to beg@@ in .
As you can see , the brain are@@ a is going up and down in each one of them , but the respon@@ ses are very different , and not in sy@@ n@@ c .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , im@@ medi@@ ately as the story is star@@ ting , something amazing is happen@@ ing .
( Au@@ dio ) J@@ O : So I &apos;m ban@@ ging out my story and I know it &apos;s good , and then I start to make it — U@@ H : S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , you can see that the respon@@ ses in all of the sub@@ jects lo@@ ck to the story , and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listen@@ ers .
So , we &apos;ll look and see five me@@ tro@@ no@@ mes .
Th@@ in@@ k of these five me@@ tro@@ no@@ mes as five bra@@ ins .
And similar to the listen@@ ers before the story star@@ ts , these me@@ tro@@ no@@ mes are going to cli@@ ck , but they &apos;re going to cli@@ ck out of p@@ ha@@ se .
( C@@ li@@ c@@ king ) Now see what will happen when I connec@@ t them together by pl@@ ac@@ ing them on these two cy@@ lin@@ ders . ( C@@ li@@ c@@ king )
Now these two cy@@ lin@@ ders start to r@@ ot@@ ate .
This r@@ ot@@ ation vi@@ bra@@ tion is going through the wo@@ od and is going to cou@@ ple all the me@@ tro@@ no@@ mes together .
And now li@@ ste@@ n to the cli@@ ck .
( S@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ zed cli@@ c@@ king ) This is what you call physical ent@@ ra@@ in@@ ment .
Now let &apos;s go back to the brain and ask : What &apos;s dri@@ ving this neu@@ ral ent@@ ra@@ in@@ ment ?
I@@ s it simply the so@@ unds that the spe@@ a@@ ker is produc@@ ing ?
O@@ r maybe it &apos;s the words .
O@@ r maybe it &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing that the spe@@ a@@ ker is trying to con@@ ve@@ y .
So to test it , we did the fol@@ lo@@ wing experi@@ ment .
F@@ ir@@ st , we took the story and play@@ ed it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
And that pres@@ er@@ ved many of the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al audi@@ t@@ ory fe@@ atur@@ es , but re@@ mo@@ ved the me@@ an@@ ing .
And it so@@ unds something like that .
( Au@@ dio ) J@@ O : ( Un@@ inte@@ lli@@ gi@@ ble ) And we f@@ la@@ sh@@ ed col@@ ors in the two bra@@ ins to indi@@ cate brain are@@ as that respon@@ d very simi@@ lar@@ ly across people .
And as you can see , this in@@ coming sound in@@ duc@@ ed ent@@ ra@@ in@@ ment or ali@@ gn@@ ment in all of the bra@@ ins in audi@@ t@@ ory cor@@ tic@@ es that process the so@@ unds , but it didn &apos;t s@@ pre@@ ad de@@ e@@ per into the brain .
Now we can take these so@@ unds and build words out of it .
Now we can take the words and start to build s@@ enten@@ ces out of them .
( Au@@ dio ) J@@ O : And they re@@ com@@ men@@ d aga@@ in@@ st cro@@ s@@ sing that line .
He says : &quot; &quot; De@@ ar J@@ i@@ m , G@@ o@@ od story . N@@ ice de@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
And to test it , we did the fol@@ lo@@ wing experi@@ ment in my lab .
We took the English story and trans@@ la@@ ted it to R@@ us@@ si@@ an .
Now you have two different so@@ unds and lingu@@ is@@ tic syste@@ ms that con@@ ve@@ y the exac@@ t same me@@ an@@ ing .
And you play the English story to the English listen@@ ers and the R@@ us@@ si@@ an story to the R@@ us@@ si@@ an listen@@ ers , and we can compar@@ e their respon@@ ses across the g@@ rou@@ ps .
And when we did that , we didn &apos;t see respon@@ ses that are similar in audi@@ t@@ ory cor@@ tic@@ es in language , because the language and sound are very different .
We believe this is because they underst@@ o@@ od the story in a very similar way , as we con@@ fir@@ med , using a test after the story en@@ ded .
And we think that this ali@@ gn@@ ment is neces@@ s@@ ary for communi@@ cation .
For example , as you can tell , I am not a na@@ tive English spe@@ a@@ ker .
I gre@@ w up with another language , and the same might be for many of you in the audi@@ ence .
And still , we can communi@@ cate .
How come ?
We think we can communi@@ cate because we have this common co@@ de that pres@@ ents me@@ an@@ ing .
So far , I &apos;ve only tal@@ ked about what &apos;s happen@@ ing in the listen@@ er &apos;s brain , in your brain , when you &apos;re listen@@ ing to tal@@ ks .
To look in the spe@@ a@@ ker &apos;s brain , we asked the spe@@ a@@ ker to go into the s@@ can@@ ner , we s@@ can his brain and then compar@@ e his brain respon@@ ses to the brain respon@@ ses of the listen@@ ers listen@@ ing to the story .
You have to remember that produc@@ ing spe@@ ec@@ h and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ ding spe@@ ec@@ h are very different pro@@ ces@@ ses .
Here we &apos;re as@@ king : How similar are they ?
To our sur@@ pri@@ se , we saw that all these comple@@ x pa@@ tter@@ ns within the listen@@ ers actually came from the spe@@ a@@ ker brain .
So produc@@ tion and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion re@@ ly on very similar pro@@ ces@@ ses .
And we also found the st@@ ron@@ ger the simi@@ lar@@ ity between the listen@@ er &apos;s brain and the spe@@ a@@ ker &apos;s brain , the better the communi@@ cation .
Now , let &apos;s take all this information together and ask : How can we use it to transmi@@ t a memor@@ y that I have from my brain to your bra@@ ins ?
So we did the fol@@ lo@@ wing experi@@ ment .
We let people wat@@ ch , for the first time in their life , a T@@ V e@@ pi@@ so@@ de from the B@@ B@@ C seri@@ es &quot; &quot; S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck , &quot; &quot; while we s@@ can@@ ned their bra@@ ins .
And then we asked them to go back to the s@@ can@@ ner and tell the story to another person that never wat@@ ched the mo@@ vi@@ e .
So let &apos;s be speci@@ fic .
Th@@ in@@ k about this exac@@ t s@@ cen@@ e , when S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck is en@@ ter@@ ing the ca@@ b in L@@ on@@ don dri@@ ven by the m@@ ur@@ der@@ er he is looking for .
W@@ ith me , as a vie@@ wer , there is a speci@@ fic brain pa@@ tter@@ n in my brain when I wat@@ ch it .
Now , the exac@@ t same pa@@ tter@@ n , I can reac@@ tiv@@ ate in my brain again by telling the word : S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck , L@@ on@@ don , m@@ ur@@ der@@ er .
And when I &apos;m transmi@@ tting these words to your bra@@ ins now , you have to re@@ con@@ struc@@ t it in your mind .
In fact , we see that pa@@ tter@@ n emer@@ ging now in your bra@@ ins .
And we were really sur@@ pri@@ sed to see that the pa@@ tter@@ n you have now in your bra@@ ins when I &apos;m descri@@ b@@ ing to you these s@@ cen@@ es would be very similar to the pa@@ tter@@ n I had when I wat@@ ched this mo@@ vi@@ e a few months ago in the s@@ can@@ ner .
This star@@ ts to tell you about the me@@ chan@@ ism by which we can tell stories and transmi@@ t information .
Because , for example , now you &apos;re listen@@ ing really hard and trying to understand what I &apos;m saying .
And I know that it &apos;s not e@@ as@@ y .
But I hope that at one point in the talk we cli@@ c@@ ked , and you got me .
And I think that in a few h@@ our@@ s , a few days , a few months , you &apos;re going to me@@ et someone at a par@@ ty , and you &apos;re going to tell him about this lec@@ ture , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly it will be as if he is stan@@ ding now here with us .
Now you can see how we can take this me@@ chan@@ ism and try to transmi@@ t memor@@ ies and kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge across people , which is wonderful , right ?
But our ability to communi@@ cate reli@@ es on our ability to have common ground .
Because , for example , if I &apos;m going to use the Bri@@ ti@@ sh sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ m &quot; hac@@ k@@ ne@@ y car@@ ri@@ age &quot; instead of &quot; ca@@ b , &quot; I know that I &apos;m going to be mis@@ ali@@ g@@ ned with most of you in the audi@@ ence .
Because we know that in many ca@@ ses , people understand the exac@@ t same story in very different ways .
So to test it in the lab , we did the fol@@ lo@@ wing experi@@ ment .
We took a story by J@@ .@@ D@@ . S@@ al@@ ing@@ er , in which a h@@ us@@ b@@ and lost tra@@ ck of his wi@@ fe in the mi@@ d@@ dle of a par@@ ty , and he &apos;s cal@@ ling his best fri@@ end , as@@ king , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you see my wi@@ fe ? &quot; &quot; For half of the sub@@ jects , we said that the wi@@ fe was having an af@@ fa@@ ir with the best fri@@ end .
For the other half , we said that the wi@@ fe is lo@@ y@@ al and the h@@ us@@ b@@ and is very j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
This one s@@ ent@@ ence before the story started was enough to make the brain respon@@ ses of all the people that belie@@ ved the wi@@ fe was having an af@@ fa@@ ir be very similar in these high@@ -@@ order are@@ as and different than the other gro@@ up .
So let me su@@ mm@@ ari@@ ze .
If everything worked as plan@@ ned ton@@ ight , I used my ability to vo@@ c@@ aliz@@ e sound to be cou@@ p@@ led to your bra@@ ins .
And I used this cou@@ pl@@ ing to transmi@@ t my brain pa@@ tter@@ ns as@@ soci@@ ated with my memor@@ ies and ideas into your bra@@ ins .
In this , I start to re@@ ve@@ al the hi@@ d@@ den neu@@ ral me@@ chan@@ ism by which we communi@@ cate .
And we know that in the future it will en@@ able us to impro@@ ve and faci@@ li@@ ta@@ te communi@@ cation .
But these stu@@ dies also re@@ ve@@ al that communi@@ cation reli@@ es on a common ground .
And we have to be really wor@@ ri@@ ed as a socie@@ ty if we lo@@ se this common ground and our ability to spe@@ ak with people that are sli@@ gh@@ tly different than us because we let a few very st@@ rong media chan@@ n@@ els take control of the mic , and man@@ i@@ pu@@ late and control the way we all think .
Because after all , the people we are cou@@ p@@ led to defin@@ e who we are .
And our des@@ i@@ re to be cou@@ p@@ led to another brain is something very ba@@ sic that star@@ ts at a very early age .
So let me fin@@ is@@ h with an example from my own priva@@ te life that I think is a good example of how cou@@ pl@@ ing to other people is really going to defin@@ e who we are .
This my son J@@ on@@ a@@ than at a very early age .
Se@@ e how he developed a vo@@ cal game together with my wi@@ fe , only from the des@@ i@@ re and p@@ ure jo@@ y of being cou@@ p@@ led to another human being .
And think how you change on a da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is from the interac@@ tion and cou@@ pl@@ ing to other people in your life .
So keep being cou@@ p@@ led to other people .
15 years ago , I vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to partici@@ pa@@ te in a research study that invol@@ ved a genetic test .
When I ar@@ ri@@ ved at the c@@ lin@@ ic to be t@@ es@@ ted , I was han@@ ded a ques@@ tion@@ na@@ i@@ re .
One of the very first ques@@ tions asked me to ch@@ ec@@ k a bo@@ x for my race : W@@ hi@@ te , black , A@@ si@@ an , or Na@@ tive Ameri@@ can .
I was@@ n &apos;t quite sure how to answer the question .
W@@ as it ai@@ med at meas@@ ur@@ ing the diversi@@ ty of research partici@@ pan@@ ts &apos; social bac@@ k@@ gro@@ unds ?
In that case , I would answer with my social identi@@ ty , and ch@@ ec@@ k the bo@@ x for &quot; &quot; black . &quot; &quot; But what if the resear@@ ch@@ ers were interes@@ ted in investi@@ g@@ ating some as@@ soci@@ ation between an@@ c@@ est@@ ry and the ris@@ k for cer@@ tain genetic tra@@ its ?
In that case , w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t they want to know something about my an@@ c@@ est@@ ry , which is just as much Euro@@ pe@@ an as A@@ fri@@ can ?
And how could they make scienti@@ fic fin@@ d@@ ings about my genes if I put down my social identi@@ ty as a black woman ?
Af@@ ter all , I consi@@ der myself a black woman with a whi@@ te fa@@ ther ra@@ ther than a whi@@ te woman with a black mother enti@@ re@@ ly for social reas@@ ons .
Wh@@ ich ra@@ cial identi@@ ty I ch@@ ec@@ k has nothing to do with my genes .
Well , des@@ pi@@ te the obvi@@ ous import@@ ance of this question to the study &apos;s scienti@@ fic v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty , I was told , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , just put down ho@@ we@@ ver you identi@@ f@@ y yourself . &quot; &quot; So I ch@@ ec@@ k &quot; &quot; black , &quot; &quot; but I had no confi@@ den@@ ce in the resul@@ ts of a study that tre@@ ated a cri@@ tical vari@@ able so un@@ scienti@@ fi@@ cally .
That person@@ al experience with the use of race in genetic t@@ esting got me thinking : Wh@@ ere else in medic@@ ine is race used to make fal@@ se bio@@ logical pre@@ dic@@ tions ?
Well , I found out that race r@@ uns de@@ e@@ p@@ ly throu@@ gh@@ out all of medical prac@@ tice .
And the more I found out , the more dist@@ ur@@ bed I became .
So@@ ci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts like me have long ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed that race is a social con@@ struc@@ tion .
When we identi@@ f@@ y people as black , whi@@ te , A@@ si@@ an , Na@@ tive Ameri@@ can , L@@ at@@ ina , we &apos;re re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to social g@@ rou@@ p@@ ings with made up de@@ mar@@ ca@@ tions that have chan@@ ged over time and v@@ ary around the world .
As a le@@ g@@ al s@@ cho@@ lar , I &apos;ve also stu@@ died how la@@ w@@ ma@@ kers , not bio@@ logi@@ sts , have in@@ ven@@ ted the le@@ g@@ al defini@@ tions of ra@@ ces .
And it &apos;s not just the vie@@ w of social scienti@@ sts .
P@@ res@@ id@@ ent B@@ ill C@@ lin@@ ton fa@@ m@@ ously de@@ clar@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I believe one of the great tru@@ ths to emer@@ ge from this tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ ant ex@@ pedi@@ tion inside the human gen@@ o@@ me is that in genetic ter@@ ms , human be@@ ings , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of race , are more than 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 percent the same . &quot; &quot; And he might have ad@@ ded that that less than one percent of genetic differ@@ ence doesn &apos;t f@@ all into ra@@ cial bo@@ xes .
&quot; &quot; I am happ@@ y that today , the only race we &apos;re talking about is the human race . &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tors are sup@@ pos@@ ed to prac@@ tice evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ based medic@@ ine , and they &apos;re incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly called to jo@@ in the gen@@ o@@ mic re@@ volu@@ tion .
But their hab@@ it of tre@@ ating patients by race la@@ gs far be@@ hind .
Ta@@ ke the esti@@ mate of glo@@ mer@@ ular fil@@ tra@@ tion rate , or G@@ F@@ R .
D@@ oc@@ tors rou@@ tin@@ e@@ ly inter@@ pre@@ t G@@ F@@ R , this important indi@@ ca@@ tor of ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y func@@ tion , by race .
As you can see in this lab test , the exac@@ t same cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine level , the con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion in the blood of the pati@@ ent , auto@@ ma@@ tically produc@@ es a different G@@ F@@ R esti@@ mate depen@@ ding on whether or not the pati@@ ent is A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can .
Why ?
I &apos;ve been told it &apos;s based on an as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans have more m@@ us@@ cle ma@@ ss than people of other ra@@ ces .
But what sense does it make for a doc@@ tor to auto@@ ma@@ tically as@@ su@@ me I have more m@@ us@@ cle ma@@ ss than that fe@@ mal@@ e bo@@ dy@@ buil@@ der ?
W@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be far more ac@@ cu@@ rate and evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ based to determin@@ e the m@@ us@@ cle ma@@ ss of individu@@ al patients just by looking at them ?
Well , doc@@ tors tell me they &apos;re using race as a sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ ut .
It &apos;s a cru@@ de but conven@@ i@@ ent pro@@ x@@ y for more important fac@@ tors , like m@@ us@@ cle ma@@ ss , en@@ z@@ y@@ me level , genetic tra@@ its they just don &apos;t have time to look for .
But race is a bad pro@@ x@@ y .
In many ca@@ ses , race ad@@ ds no re@@ lev@@ ant information at all .
It &apos;s just a dist@@ rac@@ tion .
But race also ten@@ ds to over@@ wh@@ el@@ m the c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal meas@@ ur@@ es .
It b@@ lin@@ ds doc@@ tors to patients &apos; sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms , family ill@@ n@@ es@@ ses , their hist@@ ory , their own ill@@ n@@ es@@ ses they might have — all more evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ based than the pati@@ ent &apos;s race .
R@@ ace can &apos;t sub@@ stitu@@ te for these important c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal meas@@ ur@@ es without sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ c@@ ing pati@@ ent w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being .
D@@ oc@@ tors also tell me race is just one of many fac@@ tors they take into ac@@ coun@@ t , but there are nu@@ mer@@ ous medical t@@ est@@ s , like the G@@ F@@ R , that use race ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ic@@ ally to tre@@ at black , whi@@ te , A@@ si@@ an patients differ@@ ently just because of their race .
R@@ ace medic@@ ine also lea@@ ves patients of col@@ or especi@@ ally vulner@@ able to har@@ m@@ ful bi@@ ases and ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes .
B@@ lack and L@@ at@@ ino patients are tw@@ ice as li@@ ke@@ ly to rece@@ i@@ ve no pa@@ in medi@@ cation as wh@@ it@@ es for the same pa@@ in@@ ful long b@@ one f@@ rac@@ tures because of ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes that black and bro@@ wn people feel less pa@@ in , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate their pa@@ in , and are pre@@ dis@@ pos@@ ed to drug ad@@ dic@@ tion .
The Fo@@ od and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion has even appro@@ ved a ra@@ ce@@ -@@ speci@@ fic medic@@ ine .
It &apos;s a p@@ ill called B@@ i@@ D@@ il to tre@@ at heart fa@@ il@@ ure in sel@@ f-@@ identi@@ fi@@ ed A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can patients .
A car@@ di@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ist developed this drug without re@@ gar@@ d to race or gene@@ tics , but it became conven@@ i@@ ent for com@@ mer@@ cial reas@@ ons to mar@@ ket the drug to black patients .
The F@@ D@@ A then al@@ low@@ ed the comp@@ any , the drug comp@@ any , to test the ef@@ fica@@ cy in a c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ al that only inclu@@ ded A@@ fri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can sub@@ jects .
It spe@@ cu@@ la@@ ted that race sto@@ od in as a pro@@ x@@ y for some un@@ kno@@ wn genetic fac@@ tor that af@@ fec@@ ts heart disease or respon@@ se to drugs .
But think about the dan@@ ger@@ ous mes@@ sa@@ ge it s@@ ent , that black people &apos;s bo@@ dies are so sub@@ stan@@ d@@ ard , a drug t@@ es@@ ted in them is not gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to work in other patients .
In the end , the drug comp@@ any &apos;s mar@@ ke@@ ting s@@ che@@ me fa@@ i@@ led .
For one thing , black patients were underst@@ an@@ da@@ bly w@@ ary of using a drug just for black people .
D@@ r. Sa@@ mu@@ el Car@@ tw@@ right gra@@ du@@ ated from the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia M@@ edi@@ cal S@@ ch@@ ool .
He prac@@ tic@@ ed in the De@@ ep S@@ outh before the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , and he was a w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ kno@@ wn ex@@ per@@ t on what was then called &quot; &quot; Ne@@ gr@@ o medic@@ ine . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ mo@@ ted the ra@@ cial concep@@ t of disease , that people of different ra@@ ces suf@@ fer from different dise@@ ases and experience common dise@@ ases differ@@ ently .
Car@@ tw@@ right ar@@ gu@@ ed in the 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ 0@@ s that s@@ la@@ very was ben@@ efici@@ al for black people for medical reas@@ ons .
He cla@@ i@@ med that because black people have lo@@ wer l@@ un@@ g capaci@@ ty than wh@@ it@@ es , for@@ ced la@@ b@@ or was good for them .
He w@@ r@@ ote in a medical j@@ our@@ n@@ al , &quot; &quot; It is the red vi@@ tal blood s@@ ent to the brain that liber@@ ates their min@@ ds when under the whi@@ te man &apos;s control , and it is the want of suf@@ fici@@ en@@ cy of red vi@@ tal blood that cha@@ ins their min@@ ds to ig@@ nor@@ ance and bar@@ bar@@ ism when in f@@ ree@@ dom . &quot; &quot; To sup@@ port this the@@ ory , Car@@ tw@@ right hel@@ ped to perfec@@ t a medical devi@@ ce for meas@@ ur@@ ing bre@@ a@@ thing called the spi@@ ro@@ me@@ ter to show the pres@@ u@@ med de@@ fici@@ en@@ cy in black people &apos;s l@@ un@@ gs .

I@@ ts fo@@ c@@ us on in@@ na@@ te ra@@ cial differ@@ ences in disease diver@@ ts attention and res@@ our@@ ces from the social determin@@ an@@ ts that cause ap@@ pal@@ ling ra@@ cial ga@@ ps in health : lack of ac@@ cess to high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality medical care ; food des@@ er@@ ts in po@@ or ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ; ex@@ pos@@ ure to environ@@ mental to@@ x@@ ins ; high ra@@ tes of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation ; and experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing the st@@ ress of ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation .
You see , race is not a bio@@ logical ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory that n@@ atur@@ ally produc@@ es these health dis@@ par@@ i@@ ties because of genetic differ@@ ence .
R@@ ace is a social ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory that has sta@@ gg@@ er@@ ing bio@@ logical conse@@ quen@@ ces , but because of the impac@@ t of social in@@ equ@@ ality on people &apos;s health .
Y@@ et race medic@@ ine pre@@ ten@@ ds the answer to these ga@@ ps in health can be found in a ra@@ ce@@ -@@ speci@@ fic p@@ ill .
It &apos;s much e@@ asi@@ er and more l@@ uc@@ ra@@ tive to mar@@ ket a technolo@@ gi@@ cal fi@@ x for these ga@@ ps in health than to de@@ al with the struc@@ tural in@@ equi@@ ties that produ@@ ce them .
The reason I &apos;m so pas@@ sion@@ ate about en@@ ding race medic@@ ine isn &apos;t just because it &apos;s bad medic@@ ine .
I &apos;m also on this mis@@ sion because the way doc@@ tors prac@@ tice medic@@ ine continu@@ es to pro@@ m@@ ote a fal@@ se and to@@ xi@@ c vie@@ w of human@@ ity .
Des@@ pi@@ te the many vi@@ sion@@ ary bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s in medic@@ ine we &apos;ve been learning about , there &apos;s a fa@@ il@@ ure of imag@@ in@@ ation when it comes to race .
W@@ ould you imagine with me , just a moment : What would happen if doc@@ tors st@@ op@@ ped tre@@ ating patients by race ?
Su@@ p@@ pos@@ e they re@@ jec@@ ted an 1@@ 8@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ cation system and in@@ cor@@ po@@ ra@@ ted instead the most ad@@ van@@ ced kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of human genetic diversi@@ ty and un@@ ity , that human be@@ ings cannot be ca@@ te@@ g@@ ori@@ zed into bio@@ logical ra@@ ces ?
What if , instead of using race as a cru@@ de pro@@ x@@ y for some more important fac@@ tor , doc@@ tors actually investi@@ ga@@ ted and ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed that more important fac@@ tor ?
What if doc@@ tors jo@@ in@@ ed the fo@@ re@@ front of a mo@@ ve@@ ment to end the struc@@ tural in@@ equi@@ ties ca@@ used by ra@@ ci@@ s@@ m , not by genetic differ@@ ence ?
R@@ ace medic@@ ine is bad medic@@ ine , it &apos;s po@@ or science and it &apos;s a fal@@ se inter@@ pre@@ tation of human@@ ity .
It is more ur@@ g@@ ent than ever to finally ab@@ an@@ don this bac@@ k@@ ward le@@ g@@ ac@@ y and to af@@ fir@@ m our common human@@ ity by en@@ ding the social in@@ equ@@ ali@@ ties that tru@@ ly divi@@ de us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you .
Now imagine what you could place in your han@@ ds : an ap@@ ple , maybe your wal@@ let .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a pre@@ ma@@ ture bab@@ y .
This bab@@ y is so tin@@ y he doesn &apos;t have enough f@@ at on his body to sta@@ y war@@ m .
F@@ our million of these bab@@ ies di@@ e an@@ nu@@ ally .
But the bi@@ gg@@ er problem is that the ones who do sur@@ vi@@ ve grow up with se@@ ver@@ e , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m health problems .
The reason is because in the first mon@@ th of a bab@@ y &apos;s life , its only job is to grow .
Ima@@ g@@ ine : M@@ any of these problems could be pre@@ ven@@ ted if these bab@@ ies were just ke@@ pt war@@ m .
That is the pri@@ mar@@ y func@@ tion of an in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or .
But tradi@@ tional in@@ cu@@ bat@@ ors re@@ qui@@ re elec@@ tri@@ city and co@@ st up to 20 thou@@ s@@ and dollars .
As a resul@@ t , parents res@@ or@@ t to lo@@ cal solu@@ tions like t@@ ying ho@@ t water bot@@ t@@ les around their bab@@ ies &apos; bo@@ dies , or pl@@ ac@@ ing them under light bul@@ b@@ s like the ones you see here — me@@ th@@ o@@ ds that are both in@@ effec@@ tive and un@@ sa@@ fe .
But that hospital was over four h@@ our@@ s away , and Se@@ vi@@ th@@ a didn &apos;t have the means to get there , so her bab@@ y died .
You can open it up comple@@ tely . It &apos;s wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of .
There &apos;s no se@@ a@@ ms inside so you can ster@@ ili@@ ze it very e@@ asi@@ ly .
But the ma@@ gi@@ c is in this po@@ uch of wa@@ x .
This is a p@@ ha@@ se@@ -@@ change material .
It &apos;s a wa@@ x@@ -@@ like sub@@ st@@ ance with a mel@@ ting point of human body tem@@ per@@ ature , 3@@ 7 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
O@@ ver the next five years we hope to sa@@ ve the lives of almost a million bab@@ ies .
But the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ ter@@ m social impac@@ t is a re@@ duc@@ tion in population gro@@ w@@ th .
In desig@@ ning this we fol@@ low@@ ed a few ba@@ sic princi@@ pl@@ es .
We really tri@@ ed to understand the end us@@ er , in this case , people like Se@@ vi@@ th@@ a .
We tri@@ ed to understand the roo@@ t of the problem ra@@ ther than being bi@@ a@@ sed by what already exist@@ s .
And then we thought of the most simple solu@@ tion we could to ad@@ d@@ ress this problem .
And we can sa@@ ve mi@@ llions of lives through the simple war@@ m@@ th of an E@@ m@@ bra@@ ce .
Al@@ most a year ago , my a@@ unt started suf@@ fer@@ ing back pa@@ ins .
She went to see the doc@@ tor and they told her it was a normal in@@ j@@ ur@@ y for someone who had been pla@@ ying ten@@ n@@ is for almost 30 years .
They re@@ com@@ men@@ ded that she do some ther@@ ap@@ y , but after a while she was@@ n &apos;t fe@@ el@@ ing better , so the doc@@ tors decided to do f@@ ur@@ ther t@@ est@@ s .
So finally , they decided to do a bi@@ op@@ s@@ y , and two wee@@ ks later , the resul@@ ts of the bi@@ op@@ s@@ y came back .
It was sta@@ ge 3 l@@ un@@ g cancer .
H@@ er li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le was almost f@@ ree of ris@@ k .
She never s@@ mo@@ ked a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te , she never d@@ ran@@ k al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , and she had been pla@@ ying s@@ por@@ ts for almost half her life .
Per@@ haps , that is why it took them almost six months to get her pro@@ per@@ ly diagno@@ sed .
My story might be , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , famili@@ ar to most of you .
One out of three people si@@ tting in this audi@@ ence will be diagno@@ sed with some ty@@ pe of cancer , and one out of four will di@@ e because of it .
No@@ t only did that cancer diagno@@ sis change the life of our family , but that process of going back and for@@ th with new t@@ est@@ s , different doc@@ tors descri@@ b@@ ing sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms , dis@@ car@@ ding dise@@ ases over and over , was st@@ res@@ s@@ ful and f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ting , especi@@ ally for my a@@ unt .
And that is the way cancer diagno@@ sis has been done sin@@ ce the beg@@ in@@ ning of hist@@ ory .
We have 2@@ 1@@ st@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y medical tre@@ at@@ ments and drugs to tre@@ at cancer , but we still have 20@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ es and pro@@ ces@@ ses for diagno@@ sis , if any .
To@@ day , most of us have to wa@@ it for sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms to indi@@ cate that something is wrong .
To@@ day , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of people still don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to early cancer detec@@ tion me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , even though we know that ca@@ t@@ ching cancer early is basi@@ cally the clo@@ s@@ est thing we have to a si@@ l@@ ver bul@@ let cur@@ e aga@@ in@@ st it .
We know that we can change this in our li@@ fe@@ time , and that is why my te@@ am and I have decided to beg@@ in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y to try to make cancer detec@@ tion at the early sta@@ ges and mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing the appro@@ pri@@ ate respon@@ se at the mole@@ cular level e@@ asi@@ er , che@@ ap@@ er , s@@ mar@@ ter and more ac@@ ces@@ sible than ever before .
But pro@@ g@@ ress in bio@@ te@@ ch is not only being ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated , it is also being democra@@ ti@@ zed .
J@@ ust as person@@ al compu@@ ters or the Internet or s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones le@@ ve@@ led the pla@@ ying fiel@@ d for ent@@ re@@ pren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship , poli@@ tics or education , rec@@ ent ad@@ van@@ ces have le@@ ve@@ led it up for bio@@ te@@ ch pro@@ g@@ ress as well , and that is al@@ lo@@ wing multi@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary te@@ a@@ ms like our@@ s to try to tac@@ k@@ le and look at these problems with new appro@@ ach@@ es .
We are a te@@ am of scienti@@ sts and technolo@@ gi@@ sts from C@@ hi@@ le , P@@ an@@ a@@ ma , M@@ ex@@ ico , Isra@@ el and Gre@@ ece , and based on rec@@ ent scienti@@ fic disco@@ ver@@ ies , we believe that we have found a reli@@ able and ac@@ cu@@ rate way of detec@@ ting se@@ ver@@ al ty@@ pes of cancer at the very early sta@@ ges through a blood sa@@ mp@@ le .
We do it by detec@@ ting a set of very small mole@@ cul@@ es that cir@@ cu@@ late f@@ ree@@ ly in our blood called micro@@ R@@ N@@ As .
As you might know , prote@@ ins are lar@@ ge bio@@ logical mole@@ cul@@ es that per@@ form different func@@ tions within our body , like ca@@ tal@@ y@@ zing meta@@ bo@@ li@@ c reac@@ tions or respon@@ ding to sti@@ mul@@ i or re@@ pli@@ ca@@ ting DNA , but before a prote@@ in is expres@@ sed or produc@@ ed , re@@ lev@@ ant par@@ ts of its genetic co@@ de present in the DNA are co@@ pi@@ ed into the mes@@ sen@@ ger R@@ NA , so this mes@@ sen@@ ger R@@ NA has in@@ struc@@ tions on how to build a speci@@ fic prote@@ in , and po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally it can build hundre@@ ds of prote@@ ins , but the one that te@@ lls them when to build them and how many to build are micro@@ R@@ N@@ As .
So micro@@ R@@ N@@ As are small mole@@ cul@@ es that regu@@ late gene expres@@ sion .
Un@@ like DNA , which is ma@@ in@@ ly fix@@ ed , micro@@ R@@ N@@ As can v@@ ary depen@@ ding on inter@@ n@@ al and environ@@ mental condi@@ tions at any given time , telling us which genes are ac@@ tively expres@@ sed at that particular moment .
And that is what makes micro@@ R@@ N@@ As such a pro@@ mi@@ sing bio@@ mar@@ ker for cancer , because as you know , cancer is a disease of alter@@ ed gene expres@@ sion .
It is the un@@ contro@@ l@@ led regu@@ lation of genes .
A@@ no@@ ther important thing to consi@@ der is that no two can@@ cer@@ s are the same , but at the micro@@ R@@ NA level , there are pa@@ tter@@ ns .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , the problem with micro@@ R@@ N@@ As is that we cannot use exist@@ ing D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ based technology to detec@@ t them in a reli@@ able way , because they are very sh@@ or@@ t se@@ quen@@ ces of nuc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , much s@@ mal@@ ler than DNA .
And also , all micro@@ R@@ N@@ As are very similar to each other , with just tin@@ y differ@@ ences .
So imagine trying to differ@@ enti@@ ate two mole@@ cul@@ es , extre@@ me@@ ly similar , extre@@ me@@ ly small .
We believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we &apos;ve sho@@ wn it in publi@@ c .
Let me do a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion .
Ima@@ g@@ ine that next time you go to your doc@@ tor and do your next stan@@ d@@ ard blood test , a lab tech@@ ni@@ ci@@ an extra@@ c@@ ts a tot@@ al R@@ NA , which is quite simple today , and pu@@ ts it in a stan@@ d@@ ard 9@@ 6@@ -@@ well pla@@ te like this one .
E@@ ach well of these pla@@ tes has speci@@ fic bio@@ che@@ mi@@ stry that we as@@ si@@ g@@ n , that is looking for a speci@@ fic micro@@ R@@ NA , ac@@ ting like a tra@@ p that clo@@ ses only when the micro@@ R@@ NA is present in the sa@@ mp@@ le , and when it does , it will sh@@ ine with green col@@ or .
To r@@ un the reac@@ tion , you put the pla@@ te inside a devi@@ ce like this one , and then you can put your s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one on top of it .
If we can have a cam@@ era here so you can see my s@@ cre@@ en .
A s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one is a connec@@ ted computer and it &apos;s also a cam@@ era , good enough for our pur@@ pos@@ e .
This char@@ t is sho@@ wing the speci@@ fic micro@@ R@@ N@@ As present in this sa@@ mp@@ le and how they reac@@ ted over time .
Then , if we take this speci@@ fic pa@@ tter@@ n of micro@@ R@@ NA of this person &apos;s sa@@ mp@@ les and compar@@ e it with exist@@ ing scienti@@ fic do@@ cu@@ men@@ tation that cor@@ rela@@ tes micro@@ R@@ NA pa@@ tter@@ ns with a speci@@ fic pres@@ ence of a disease , this is how pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer loo@@ ks like .
This inside is a real sa@@ mp@@ le where we just detec@@ ted pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer .
If we want to better understand and de@@ co@@ de dise@@ ases like cancer , we need to stop tre@@ ating them as ac@@ u@@ te , i@@ so@@ la@@ ted e@@ pi@@ so@@ des , and consi@@ der and meas@@ ure everything that af@@ fec@@ ts our health on a per@@ man@@ ent bas@@ is .
This entire pla@@ t@@ form is a working pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
S@@ in@@ ce we believe early cancer detec@@ tion should really be democra@@ ti@@ zed , this entire solu@@ tion co@@ sts at le@@ ast 50 times less than cur@@ r@@ ent a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , and we know that the commun@@ ity can help us ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate this even more , so we &apos;re making the desig@@ n of the devi@@ ce op@@ en@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ ce .
( Applause ) Let me say very c@@ lear@@ ly that we are at the very early sta@@ ges , but so far , we have been able to suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly identi@@ f@@ y the micro@@ R@@ NA pa@@ tter@@ n of pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , l@@ un@@ g cancer , bre@@ ast cancer and he@@ pa@@ tic cancer .
And cur@@ r@@ ently , we &apos;re doing a c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ al in col@@ labor@@ ation with the G@@ er@@ man Can@@ cer R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ en@@ ter with 200 wo@@ men for bre@@ ast cancer .
( Applause ) This is the single n@@ on-@@ in@@ va@@ sive , ac@@ cu@@ rate and af@@ for@@ da@@ ble test that has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to dra@@ ma@@ tically change how cancer pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ es and diagno@@ stics have been done .
S@@ in@@ ce we &apos;re looking for the micro@@ R@@ NA pa@@ tter@@ ns in your blood at any given time , you don &apos;t need to know which cancer you &apos;re looking for .
You don &apos;t need to have any sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms .
You only need one mi@@ lli@@ li@@ ter of blood and a rela@@ tively simple arra@@ y of to@@ ols .
To@@ day , cancer detec@@ tion happens ma@@ in@@ ly when sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms ap@@ pe@@ ar .
That is , at sta@@ ge 3 or 4 , and I believe that is too late .
It is too ex@@ pen@@ sive for our famili@@ es .
It is too ex@@ pen@@ sive for human@@ ity .
We cannot lo@@ se the w@@ ar aga@@ in@@ st cancer .
It not only co@@ sts us bi@@ llions of dollars , but it also co@@ sts us the people we love .
To@@ day , my a@@ unt , she &apos;s fi@@ gh@@ ting bra@@ vely and going through this process with a very posi@@ tive at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , I want fi@@ ghts like this to become very r@@ are .
I want to see the day when cancer is tre@@ ated e@@ asi@@ ly because it can be rou@@ tin@@ e@@ ly diagno@@ sed at the very early sta@@ ges , and I &apos;m cer@@ tain that in the very ne@@ ar future , because of this and other bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s that we are see@@ ing every day in the life sci@@ ences , the way we see cancer will ra@@ dic@@ ally change .
It will give us the chan@@ ce of detec@@ ting it early , underst@@ an@@ ding it better , and fin@@ ding a cur@@ e .
Thank you very much .

I want to ad@@ d@@ ress the is@@ su@@ e of compassion .
Co@@ m@@ pas@@ sion has many fac@@ es .
So@@ me of them are fi@@ er@@ ce ; some of them are w@@ ra@@ th@@ ful ; some of them are ten@@ der ; some of them are wi@@ se .
A line that the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ a@@ ma on@@ ce said , he said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ve and compassion are neces@@ si@@ ties .
They are not lu@@ xu@@ ri@@ es .
W@@ i@@ th@@ out them , human@@ ity cannot sur@@ vi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And I would su@@ gg@@ est , it is not only human@@ ity that w@@ on &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve , but it is all species on the plan@@ et , as we &apos;ve heard today .
It is the big ca@@ ts , and it &apos;s the plan@@ k@@ ton .
T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks ago , I was in B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore in In@@ dia .
I was so pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to be able to te@@ ach in a ho@@ s@@ pic@@ e on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore .
And early in the mor@@ ning , I went into the ward .
In that ho@@ s@@ pic@@ e , there were 3@@ 1 men and wo@@ men who were ac@@ tively d@@ ying .
And I wal@@ ked up to the be@@ d@@ side of an old woman who was bre@@ a@@ thing very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly , fra@@ gi@@ le , obvi@@ ously in the la@@ tter p@@ ha@@ se of ac@@ tive d@@ ying .
I looked into her face .
I looked into the face of her son si@@ tting next to her , and his face was just ri@@ ven with g@@ ri@@ e@@ f and con@@ fu@@ sion .
And I re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed a line from the Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata , the great In@@ di@@ an e@@ pi@@ c : &quot; What is the most won@@ dro@@ us thing in the world , Y@@ ud@@ h@@ is@@ th@@ ira ? &quot;
And Y@@ ud@@ h@@ is@@ th@@ ira re@@ pli@@ ed , &quot; &quot; The most won@@ dro@@ us thing in the world is that all around us people can be d@@ ying and we don &apos;t realiz@@ e it can happen to us . &quot; &quot; I looked up .
T@@ en@@ ding those 3@@ 1 d@@ ying people were young wo@@ men from vi@@ l@@ la@@ ges around B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore .
I looked into the face of one of these wo@@ men , and I saw in her face the str@@ eng@@ th that ar@@ is@@ es when natural compassion is really present .
I wat@@ ched her han@@ ds as she ba@@ the@@ d an old man .
My ga@@ ze went to another young woman as she wi@@ ped the face of another d@@ ying person .
And it re@@ min@@ ded me of something that I had just been present for .
E@@ very year or so , I have the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of taking c@@ lin@@ i@@ ci@@ ans into the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as and the Ti@@ be@@ tan P@@ la@@ te@@ a@@ u .
And we r@@ un c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s in these very re@@ m@@ ote re@@ gi@@ ons where there &apos;s no medical care w@@ ha@@ t@@ so@@ ever .
And on the first day at S@@ imi@@ k@@ o@@ t in H@@ u@@ m@@ la , far w@@ est of Ne@@ p@@ al , the most im@@ po@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ed re@@ gi@@ on of Ne@@ p@@ al , an old man came in c@@ lu@@ t@@ ching a b@@ und@@ le of ra@@ gs .
And he wal@@ ked in , and somebody said something to him , we realiz@@ ed he was de@@ a@@ f , and we looked into the ra@@ gs , and there was this pa@@ ir of eyes .
The ra@@ gs were un@@ w@@ rap@@ ped from a little gir@@ l wh@@ ose body was mas@@ si@@ vely bur@@ ned .
A@@ ga@@ in , the eyes and han@@ ds of A@@ val@@ o@@ k@@ it@@ es@@ h@@ v@@ ara .
It was the young wo@@ men , the health ai@@ ds , who c@@ le@@ an@@ ed the wo@@ unds of this bab@@ y and d@@ res@@ sed the wo@@ unds .
I know those han@@ ds and eyes ; they tou@@ ched me as well .
They tou@@ ched me at that time .
They have tou@@ ched me throu@@ gh@@ out my 6@@ 8 years .
They tou@@ ched me when I was four and I lost my ey@@ esi@@ ght and was par@@ ti@@ ally par@@ al@@ y@@ zed .
And my family b@@ rou@@ ght in a woman wh@@ ose mother had been a s@@ la@@ ve to take care of me .
And that woman did not have senti@@ mental compassion .
She had ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al str@@ eng@@ th .
And it was really her str@@ eng@@ th , I believe , that became the kind of m@@ ud@@ ra and imp@@ ri@@ ma@@ tu@@ r that has been a gu@@ i@@ ding light in my life .
So we can ask : What is compassion com@@ pri@@ sed of ?
And there are vari@@ ous fac@@ e@@ ts .
And there &apos;s re@@ fer@@ enti@@ al and n@@ on-@@ re@@ fer@@ enti@@ al compassion .
But first , compassion is com@@ pri@@ sed of that capaci@@ ty to see c@@ lear@@ ly into the n@@ ature of suf@@ fer@@ ing .
It is that ability to really st@@ and st@@ rong and to recogni@@ ze also that I &apos;m not separ@@ ate from this suf@@ fer@@ ing .
But that is not enough , because compassion , which activ@@ ates the mot@@ or cor@@ tex , means that we as@@ pi@@ re , we actually as@@ pi@@ re to trans@@ form suf@@ fer@@ ing .
And if we &apos;re so b@@ l@@ es@@ sed , we eng@@ age in activi@@ ties that trans@@ form suf@@ fer@@ ing .
But compassion has another com@@ pon@@ ent , and that com@@ pon@@ ent is really es@@ senti@@ al .
That com@@ pon@@ ent is that we cannot be at@@ ta@@ ched to out@@ come .
Now I worked with d@@ ying people for over 40 years .
I had the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of working on death row in a ma@@ x@@ im@@ um se@@ curi@@ ty &#91; pri@@ son &#93; for six years .
And I realiz@@ ed so c@@ lear@@ ly in br@@ ing@@ ing my own life experience , from working with d@@ ying people and tra@@ in@@ ing car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver@@ s , that any at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ment to out@@ come would dist@@ or@@ t de@@ e@@ p@@ ly my own capaci@@ ty to be ful@@ ly present to the whole ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he .
And when I worked in the pri@@ son system , it was so c@@ lear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row , the see@@ ds of their own compassion had never been wa@@ ter@@ ed .
That compassion is actually an in@@ her@@ ent human qu@@ ality .
It is there within every human being .
But the condi@@ tions for compassion to be activ@@ ated , to be ar@@ ou@@ sed , are particular condi@@ tions .
I had that condi@@ tion , to a cer@@ tain ex@@ t@@ ent , from my own chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od ill@@ ness .
E@@ ve En@@ s@@ ler , who@@ m you &apos;ll he@@ ar later , has had that condi@@ tion activ@@ ated ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly in her through the vari@@ ous wa@@ ters of suf@@ fer@@ ing that she has been through .
And what is fas@@ cin@@ ating is that compassion has en@@ e@@ mi@@ es , and those en@@ e@@ mi@@ es are things like p@@ ity , moral ou@@ tra@@ ge , fe@@ ar .
And you know , we have a socie@@ ty , a world , that is par@@ al@@ y@@ zed by fe@@ ar .
And in that par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , of course , our capaci@@ ty for compassion is also par@@ al@@ y@@ zed .
The very word ter@@ ro@@ r is global .
The very fe@@ el@@ ing of ter@@ ro@@ r is global .
So our work , in a cer@@ tain way , is to ad@@ d@@ ress this ima@@ go , this kind of ar@@ che@@ ty@@ pe that has per@@ va@@ ded the p@@ sy@@ che of our entire glo@@ be .
Now we know from neuro@@ science that compassion has some very extraordin@@ ary qu@@ ali@@ ties .
For example : A person who is cul@@ tiv@@ ating compassion , when they are in the pres@@ ence of suf@@ fer@@ ing , they feel that suf@@ fer@@ ing a lot more than many other people do .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , they re@@ turn to base@@ line a lot so@@ on@@ er .
This is called res@@ ili@@ ence .
M@@ any of us think that compassion dra@@ ins us , but I pro@@ mi@@ se you it is something that tru@@ ly en@@ li@@ ven@@ s us .
A@@ no@@ ther thing about compassion is that it really en@@ han@@ ces what &apos;s called neu@@ ral inte@@ gra@@ tion .
It ho@@ o@@ ks up all par@@ ts of the brain .
A@@ no@@ ther , which has been disco@@ vered by vari@@ ous resear@@ ch@@ ers at E@@ mor@@ y and at D@@ av@@ is and so on , is that compassion en@@ han@@ ces our im@@ mun@@ e system .
H@@ ey , we live in a very no@@ xi@@ ous world .
( Laughter ) Mo@@ st of us are sh@@ r@@ in@@ king in the face of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ -@@ social and physical po@@ is@@ ons , of the to@@ x@@ ins of our world .
But compassion , the gener@@ ation of compassion , actually mo@@ bili@@ z@@ es our im@@ mun@@ ity .
You know , if compassion is so good for us , I have a question .
Why don &apos;t we tra@@ in our children in compassion ?
( Applause ) If compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we tra@@ in our health care pro@@ vi@@ ders in compassion so that they can do what they &apos;re sup@@ pos@@ ed to do , which is to really trans@@ form suf@@ fer@@ ing ?
And if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we v@@ ote on compassion ?
Why don &apos;t we v@@ ote for people in our government based on compassion , so that we can have a more car@@ ing world ?
In B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ ism , we say , &quot; &quot; it takes a st@@ rong back and a so@@ ft front . &quot; &quot; It takes tre@@ men@@ dous str@@ eng@@ th of the back to u@@ ph@@ old yourself in the mi@@ d@@ st of condi@@ tions .
And that is the mental qu@@ ality of equ@@ ani@@ mi@@ ty .
But it also takes a so@@ ft front — the capaci@@ ty to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defen@@ ded heart .
And the ar@@ che@@ ty@@ pe of this in B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ ism is A@@ val@@ o@@ k@@ it@@ es@@ h@@ v@@ ara , K@@ u@@ an@@ -@@ Y@@ in .
It &apos;s a fe@@ mal@@ e ar@@ che@@ ty@@ pe : she who per@@ ce@@ i@@ ves the cri@@ es of suf@@ fer@@ ing in the world .
She stan@@ ds with 10@@ ,000 ar@@ ms , and in every hand , there is an instru@@ ment of liber@@ ation , and in the pal@@ m of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wis@@ dom .
I say that , for thousands of years , wo@@ men have li@@ ved , exemp@@ li@@ fi@@ ed , me@@ t in in@@ ti@@ mac@@ y , the ar@@ che@@ ty@@ pe of A@@ val@@ o@@ k@@ it@@ es@@ v@@ ara , of K@@ u@@ an@@ -@@ Y@@ in , she who per@@ ce@@ i@@ ves the cri@@ es of suf@@ fer@@ ing in the world .
W@@ o@@ men have man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ted for thousands of years the str@@ eng@@ th ar@@ is@@ ing from compassion in an un@@ fil@@ ter@@ ed , un@@ medi@@ ated way in per@@ ce@@ i@@ ving suf@@ fer@@ ing as it is .
They have in@@ fu@@ sed socie@@ ties with kin@@ d@@ ness , and we have really fel@@ t that as woman after woman has sto@@ od on this sta@@ ge in the pa@@ st day and a half .
And they have actu@@ aliz@@ ed compassion through direc@@ t ac@@ tion .
Jo@@ dy W@@ il@@ li@@ a@@ ms called it : It &apos;s good to medi@@ ta@@ te .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , you &apos;ve got to do a little bit of that , Jo@@ dy .
Ste@@ p back , give your mother a bre@@ ak , o@@ kay .
( Laughter ) But the other side of the equ@@ ation is you &apos;ve got to come out of your ca@@ ve .
You have to come into the world like As@@ an@@ ga did , who was looking to realiz@@ e Ma@@ it@@ re@@ y@@ a B@@ ud@@ d@@ ha after 12 years si@@ tting in the ca@@ ve .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of here . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going down the pa@@ th .
He se@@ es something in the pa@@ th .
He loo@@ ks , it &apos;s a do@@ g , he dro@@ ps to his k@@ ne@@ es .
He se@@ es that the do@@ g has this big w@@ ound on its le@@ g .
The w@@ ound is just fil@@ led with ma@@ gg@@ ots .
He pu@@ ts out his ton@@ gue in order to re@@ move the ma@@ gg@@ ots , so as not to har@@ m them .
And at that moment , the do@@ g trans@@ for@@ med into the B@@ ud@@ d@@ ha of love and kin@@ d@@ ness .
I believe that wo@@ men and gir@@ ls today have to par@@ t@@ ner in a power@@ ful way with men — with their fa@@ thers , with their s@@ ons , with their bro@@ thers , with the p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ers , the ro@@ ad buil@@ ders , the car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver@@ s , the doc@@ tors , the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , with our pres@@ id@@ ent , and with all be@@ ings .
The wo@@ men in this room are l@@ ot@@ us@@ es in a sea of fire .
M@@ ay we actu@@ aliz@@ e that capaci@@ ty for wo@@ men every@@ where .
Thank you .

The brain is an amazing and comple@@ x org@@ an .
And so in order to be able to ac@@ cess the brain , you really need to de@@ di@@ cate your life and s@@ pen@@ d six and a half years as a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent just to become a neuro@@ scienti@@ st to get ac@@ cess to these to@@ ols .
And there are z@@ ero cur@@ es for these dise@@ ases .
You gu@@ ys want to see some ?
So I need a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
So right before — what is your name ? ( Applause ) S@@ am K@@ el@@ ly : S@@ am .
Gre@@ g G@@ age : All right , S@@ am , I &apos;m going to recor@@ d from your brain .
S@@ K : No .
They &apos;re sen@@ ding elec@@ tri@@ cal mes@@ sa@@ ges back and for@@ th , and che@@ mi@@ cal mes@@ sa@@ ges .
So I &apos;m going to turn this on for a second .
Let &apos;s take a look at it as well .
So I &apos;m going to st@@ and over here , and I &apos;m going to open up our ap@@ p here .
So now I want you to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze .
What is your name , si@@ r ?
You &apos;re going to st@@ and right here .
I want you to move your ar@@ m as well .
So your brain is going to sen@@ d a si@@ gn@@ al down to your m@@ us@@ c@@ les .
So in a sense , she will take away your f@@ ree will and you will no lon@@ ger have any control over this hand .
You with me ?
So I just need to ho@@ ok you up .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to find your ul@@ n@@ ar ner@@ ve , which is probably right around here .
Okay , so S@@ am , I want you to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze your hand again .
D@@ o it again . Per@@ fec@@ t .
Now I want you to rela@@ x your hand .
S@@ am , you &apos;re with me ?
So you &apos;re going to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze .
I &apos;m not going to turn it on yet , so go a@@ head and give it a s@@ que@@ e@@ ze .
M@@ G : Re@@ ad@@ y as I &apos;ll ever be .
G@@ G : I &apos;ve tur@@ ned it on , so go a@@ head and turn your hand .
D@@ o you feel that a little bit ? M@@ G : N@@ op@@ e .
G@@ G : A little bit ? ( Laughter ) So rela@@ x .
So h@@ it it again .
( Laughter ) Oh , perfec@@ t , perfec@@ t .
So rela@@ x , do it again .
All right , so right now , your brain is contro@@ lling your ar@@ m and it &apos;s also contro@@ lling his ar@@ m , so go a@@ head and just do it one more time .
All right , so it &apos;s perfec@@ t . ( Laughter ) So now , what would happen if I took over my control of your hand ?
And so , just rela@@ x your hand .
What happens ?
A@@ h , nothing .
Why not ?
Because the brain has to do it .
So you do it again .
All right , that &apos;s perfec@@ t .
Thank you gu@@ ys for being such a good s@@ port .
This is what &apos;s happen@@ ing all across the world — elec@@ tro@@ physi@@ o@@ logy !

M@@ e@@ et T@@ ony . He &apos;s my stud@@ ent .
He &apos;s about my age , and he &apos;s in S@@ an Qu@@ enti@@ n Sta@@ te Pri@@ son .
When T@@ ony was 1@@ 6 years old , one day , one moment , &quot; &quot; It was mo@@ m &apos;s g@@ un .
J@@ ust f@@ la@@ sh it , s@@ care the guy . He &apos;s a pun@@ k .
He took some money ; we &apos;ll take his money . That &apos;ll te@@ ach him .
Then last minu@@ te , I &apos;m thinking , &apos; C@@ an &apos;t do this . This is wrong . &apos; My bu@@ d@@ dy says , &apos; C &apos;@@ mon , let &apos;s do this . &apos; I say , &apos; Let &apos;s do this . &apos; &quot; &quot; And those three words , T@@ ony &apos;s going to remember , because the next thing he kno@@ ws , he hear@@ s the po@@ p .
There &apos;s the pun@@ k on the ground , pu@@ d@@ dle of blood .
And that &apos;s fel@@ ony m@@ ur@@ der — 25 to life , par@@ o@@ le at 50 if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , and T@@ ony &apos;s not fe@@ el@@ ing very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
So when we me@@ et in my phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y cla@@ ss in his pri@@ son and I say , &quot; &quot; In this cla@@ ss , we will dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions of e@@ th@@ ic@@ s , &quot; &quot; T@@ ony inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ts me .
&quot; &quot; What are you going to te@@ ach me about right and wrong ?
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
I am told every day , by every face I see , every w@@ all I face , that I am wrong .
If I ever get out of here , there will always be a mar@@ k by my name .
I &apos;m a con@@ vi@@ c@@ t ; I am br@@ an@@ ded &apos; wrong . &apos; What are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot; &quot; So I say to T@@ ony , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , but it &apos;s wor@@ se than you think .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
I want to know about w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness it@@ self , the idea of wrong .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
How do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? Ma@@ ybe you and I disa@@ gre@@ e .
Ma@@ ybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
Ma@@ ybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me — but we &apos;re not here to tra@@ de op@@ ini@@ ons ; everyone &apos;s got an op@@ ini@@ on .
We are here for kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge .
Ou@@ r en@@ e@@ my is thou@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ness . This is phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y . &quot; &quot; And something chan@@ ges for T@@ ony .
&quot; &quot; C@@ ould be I &apos;m wrong . I &apos;m ti@@ red of being wrong .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot; &quot; What T@@ ony se@@ es in that moment is the project of phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y , the project that beg@@ ins in won@@ der — what K@@ ant called &quot; &quot; ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion and a@@ we at the star@@ ry sk@@ y ab@@ o@@ ve and the moral la@@ w within . &quot; &quot; What can cre@@ atur@@ es like us know of such things ?
It is the project that always takes us back to the condi@@ tion of exist@@ ence — what H@@ e@@ ide@@ gg@@ er called &quot; &quot; the always already there . &quot; &quot; It is the project of ques@@ tion@@ ing what we believe and why we believe it — what So@@ cra@@ tes called &quot; &quot; the ex@@ a@@ min@@ ed life . &quot; &quot; So@@ cra@@ tes , a man wi@@ se enough to know that he kno@@ ws nothing .
So@@ cra@@ tes died in pri@@ son , his phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y in@@ tac@@ t .
So T@@ ony star@@ ts doing his ho@@ me@@ work .
He lear@@ ns his wh@@ ys and wh@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ es , his caus@@ es and cor@@ rela@@ tions , his logi@@ c , his fal@@ la@@ ci@@ es .
Tur@@ ns out , T@@ ony &apos;s got the phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y m@@ us@@ cle .
H@@ is body is in pri@@ son , but his mind is f@@ ree .
T@@ ony lear@@ ns about the on@@ to@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally pro@@ mis@@ cu@@ ous , the e@@ p@@ is@@ te@@ mo@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally an@@ xi@@ ous , the e@@ th@@ ic@@ ally du@@ bi@@ ous , the meta@@ physi@@ cally ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
That &apos;s P@@ la@@ to , Des@@ car@@ tes , N@@ i@@ et@@ z@@ s@@ che and B@@ ill C@@ lin@@ ton .
So when he gi@@ ves me his final pa@@ per , in which he ar@@ gu@@ es that the ca@@ te@@ g@@ ori@@ cal im@@ per@@ a@@ tive is per@@ haps too un@@ com@@ pro@@ mi@@ sing to de@@ al with the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t that af@@ fec@@ ts our every@@ day and ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es me to tell him whether ther@@ e@@ fore we are con@@ de@@ m@@ ned to moral fa@@ il@@ ure , I say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Let us think about that . &quot; &quot; Because in that moment , there &apos;s no mar@@ k by T@@ ony &apos;s name ; it &apos;s just the two of us stan@@ ding there .
It is not profes@@ s@@ or and con@@ vi@@ c@@ t , it is just two min@@ ds ready to do phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
And I say to T@@ ony , &quot; Let &apos;s do this . &quot;
Thank you .

I was a sur@@ gi@@ cal res@@ id@@ ent at The Jo@@ h@@ ns H@@ op@@ kin@@ s Ho@@ spi@@ tal , taking emer@@ gen@@ cy call .
I can still remember sort of that s@@ me@@ ll of r@@ ot@@ ting fl@@ es@@ h as I pul@@ led the cur@@ tain back to see her .
And every@@ body there ag@@ re@@ ed this woman was very si@@ ck and she nee@@ ded to be in the hospital .
That was@@ n &apos;t being asked .
The question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an amp@@ u@@ tation ?
Now , looking back on that ni@@ ght , I &apos;d love so des@@ per@@ ately to believe that I tre@@ ated that woman on that ni@@ ght with the same em@@ path@@ y and compassion I &apos;d sho@@ wn the 2@@ 7@@ -@@ year@@ -old ne@@ w@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ed who came to the E@@ .@@ R@@ . three ni@@ ghts ear@@ li@@ er with lo@@ wer back pa@@ in that tur@@ ned out to be ad@@ van@@ ced pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer .
In her case , I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to sa@@ ve her life .
The cancer was too ad@@ van@@ ced .
I b@@ rou@@ ght some for her parents .
But more import@@ an@@ tly , see , I pas@@ sed no j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment on her , because obvi@@ ously she had done nothing to br@@ ing this on her@@ self .
So why was it that , just a few ni@@ ghts later , as I sto@@ od in that same E@@ .@@ R@@ . and determin@@ ed that my diabe@@ tic pati@@ ent did in@@ de@@ ed need an amp@@ u@@ tation , why did I h@@ old her in such b@@ it@@ ter con@@ temp@@ t ?
She was f@@ at .
I mean , how hard can it be ?
As I looked down at her in the bed , I thought to myself , if you just tri@@ ed car@@ ing even a little bit , you w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be in this situ@@ ation at this moment with some doc@@ tor you &apos;ve never me@@ t about to amp@@ u@@ ta@@ te your fo@@ o@@ t .
But I actually do .
You see , in the hu@@ br@@ is of my y@@ outh , I thought I had her all fi@@ gu@@ red out .
She ate too much . She got un@@ l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
She got diabe@@ tes . C@@ ase clo@@ sed .
Y@@ et when it came to a disease like diabe@@ tes that ki@@ lls Amer@@ ic@@ ans ei@@ ght times more f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently than me@@ lan@@ o@@ ma , I never on@@ ce ques@@ tion@@ ed the conven@@ tional wis@@ dom .
I actually just as@@ su@@ med the path@@ o@@ logi@@ c se@@ qu@@ ence of ev@@ ents was se@@ tt@@ led science .
Th@@ ree years later , I found out how wrong I was .
But this time , I was the pati@@ ent .
Des@@ pi@@ te exer@@ ci@@ sing three or four h@@ our@@ s every single day , and fol@@ lo@@ wing the food p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d to the le@@ tter , I &apos;d ga@@ in@@ ed a lot of we@@ ight and developed something called meta@@ bo@@ li@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
So@@ me of you may have heard of this .
I had become in@@ sul@@ in@@ -@@ resist@@ ant .
You can think of in@@ su@@ li@@ n as this mas@@ ter hor@@ m@@ one that contro@@ ls what our body does with the fo@@ o@@ ds we eat , whether we bur@@ n it or st@@ ore it .
This is called fu@@ el par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ing in the lin@@ go .
And in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance , as its name su@@ gg@@ est@@ s , is when your cells get incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly resist@@ ant to the effec@@ t of in@@ su@@ li@@ n trying to do its job .
W@@ ith that s@@ care , I got bus@@ y chan@@ ging my di@@ et ra@@ dic@@ ally , ad@@ ding and sub@@ tra@@ c@@ ting things most of you would find almost as@@ su@@ re@@ d@@ ly sho@@ c@@ king .
I did this and lost 40 po@@ unds , we@@ ir@@ d@@ ly while exer@@ ci@@ sing less .
I , as you can see , I gu@@ ess I &apos;m not over@@ we@@ ight any@@ more .
If the conven@@ tional wis@@ dom about nu@@ tri@@ tion had fa@@ i@@ led me , was it possible it was fa@@ il@@ ing someone else ?
And under@@ l@@ ying these ques@@ tions , I became almost man@@ i@@ ac@@ ally ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed in trying to understand the real rela@@ tion@@ ship between ob@@ es@@ ity and in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance .
Now , most resear@@ ch@@ ers believe ob@@ es@@ ity is the cause of in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance .
You tre@@ at the ob@@ es@@ ity .
But what if we have it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds ?
What if ob@@ es@@ ity isn &apos;t the cause of in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance at all ?
In fact , what if it &apos;s a sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m of a much de@@ e@@ per problem , the ti@@ p of a pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g ?
I &apos;m not su@@ gg@@ esting that ob@@ es@@ ity is ben@@ ig@@ n , but what I am su@@ gg@@ esting is it may be the l@@ es@@ ser of two meta@@ bo@@ li@@ c evi@@ ls .
So now , when in@@ su@@ li@@ n says to a cell , I want you to bur@@ n more energy than the cell consi@@ ders sa@@ fe , the cell , in effec@@ t , says , &quot; No th@@ an@@ ks , I &apos;d actually ra@@ ther st@@ ore this energy . &quot;
So for many of us , about 7@@ 5 million Amer@@ ic@@ ans , the appro@@ pri@@ ate respon@@ se to in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance may actually be to st@@ ore it as f@@ at , not the re@@ ver@@ se , getting in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance in respon@@ se to getting f@@ at .
This is a really sub@@ t@@ le dist@@ inc@@ tion , but the imp@@ li@@ cation could be pro@@ found .
Con@@ si@@ der the fol@@ lo@@ wing anal@@ o@@ gy : Th@@ in@@ k of the br@@ u@@ i@@ se you get on your sh@@ in when you in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ban@@ g your le@@ g into the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e table .
S@@ ure , the br@@ u@@ i@@ se h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell , and you almost cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t like the disco@@ lo@@ red look , but we all know the br@@ u@@ i@@ se per Se is not the problem .
In fact , it &apos;s the op@@ posi@@ te . It &apos;s a health@@ y respon@@ se to the tra@@ u@@ ma , all of those im@@ mun@@ e cells r@@ us@@ hing to the si@@ te of the in@@ j@@ ur@@ y to sal@@ v@@ age cel@@ lu@@ lar de@@ br@@ is and pre@@ v@@ ent the s@@ pre@@ ad of infec@@ tion to el@@ se@@ where in the body .
Now , imagine we thought br@@ u@@ is@@ es were the problem , and we e@@ vol@@ ved a gi@@ ant medical esta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ment and a culture around tre@@ ating br@@ u@@ is@@ es : mas@@ king crea@@ ms , pa@@ in@@ ki@@ ll@@ ers , you name it , all the while ig@@ nor@@ ing the fact that people are still ban@@ ging their sh@@ ins into co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ta@@ bles .
Ge@@ tting it wrong , and the ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ u@@ tical indu@@ stry can still do very well for its sh@@ are@@ h@@ ol@@ ders but nothing impro@@ ves for the people with br@@ u@@ i@@ sed sh@@ ins .
C@@ au@@ se and effec@@ t .
So what I &apos;m su@@ gg@@ esting is maybe we have the cause and effec@@ t wrong on ob@@ es@@ ity and in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance .
Ma@@ ybe we should be as@@ king ourselves , is it possible that in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance caus@@ es we@@ ight ga@@ in and the dise@@ ases as@@ soci@@ ated with ob@@ es@@ ity , at le@@ ast in most people ?
Let &apos;s look at some su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ve fac@@ ts .
And by the way , they don &apos;t ap@@ pe@@ ar to be at any gre@@ ater ris@@ k of disease than le@@ an people .
Now I don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells ha@@ ven &apos;t actually fi@@ gu@@ red out the right thing to do with that ex@@ cess energy .
So if you can be ob@@ ese and not have in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance , and you can be le@@ an and have it , this su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that ob@@ es@@ ity may just be a pro@@ x@@ y for what &apos;s going on .
So what if we &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting the wrong w@@ ar , fi@@ gh@@ ting ob@@ es@@ ity ra@@ ther than in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance ?
E@@ ven wor@@ se , what if b@@ la@@ ming the ob@@ ese means we &apos;re b@@ la@@ ming the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms ?
Per@@ son@@ ally , I can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance any@@ more , let al@@ one the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y of cer@@ tain@@ ty .
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but I &apos;m wi@@ de open to others .
If you ask yourself , what &apos;s a cell trying to protec@@ t it@@ self from when it be@@ comes in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ant , the answer probably isn &apos;t too much food .
It &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly too much g@@ lu@@ co@@ se : blood su@@ gar .
When I lost my 40 po@@ unds a few years ago , I did it simply by r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ ting those things , which ad@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ d@@ ly su@@ gg@@ est@@ s I have a bi@@ as based on my person@@ al experience .
But that doesn &apos;t mean my bi@@ as is wrong , and most important , all of this can be t@@ es@@ ted scienti@@ fi@@ cally .
But ste@@ p one is ac@@ cep@@ ting the pos@@ si@@ bility that our cur@@ r@@ ent beli@@ ef@@ s about ob@@ es@@ ity , diabe@@ tes and in@@ su@@ li@@ n resist@@ ance could be wrong and ther@@ e@@ fore must be t@@ es@@ ted .
I &apos;m be@@ tting my car@@ e@@ er on this .
To@@ day , I de@@ v@@ ote all of my time to working on this problem , and I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever the science takes me .
I &apos;ve decided that what I can &apos;t and w@@ on &apos;t do any@@ more is pre@@ ten@@ d I have the ans@@ w@@ ers when I don &apos;t .
I &apos;ve been hu@@ mb@@ led enough by all I don &apos;t know .
For the pa@@ st year , I &apos;ve been for@@ tun@@ ate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing te@@ am of diabe@@ tes and ob@@ es@@ ity resear@@ ch@@ ers in the country , and the best part is , just like A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m L@@ in@@ col@@ n sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded hi@@ m@@ self with a te@@ am of ri@@ v@@ als , we &apos;ve done the same thing .
We &apos;ve rec@@ ru@@ i@@ ted a te@@ am of scienti@@ fic ri@@ v@@ als , the best and bri@@ gh@@ test who all have different hy@@ po@@ th@@ eses for what &apos;s at the heart of this e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic .
So@@ me think it &apos;s too many cal@@ ories consu@@ med .
O@@ thers think it &apos;s too much di@@ e@@ tar@@ y f@@ at .
O@@ thers think it &apos;s too many re@@ fin@@ ed gra@@ ins and star@@ ches .
But this te@@ am of multi@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary , high@@ ly s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical and ex@@ ce@@ e@@ d@@ ing@@ ly tal@@ en@@ ted resear@@ ch@@ ers do ag@@ ree on two things .
F@@ ir@@ st , this problem is just simply too important to continu@@ e ig@@ nor@@ ing because we think we know the answer .
And two , if we &apos;re wi@@ lling to be wrong , if we &apos;re wi@@ lling to ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge the conven@@ tional wis@@ dom with the best experi@@ ments science can of@@ fer , we can sol@@ ve this problem .
I know it &apos;s temp@@ ting to want an answer right now , some form of ac@@ tion or poli@@ cy , some di@@ e@@ tar@@ y pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion — eat this , not that — but if we want to get it right , we &apos;re going to have to do much more ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous science before we can wri@@ te that pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
F@@ ir@@ st , how do the vari@@ ous fo@@ o@@ ds we consu@@ me impac@@ t our meta@@ bo@@ li@@ s@@ m , hormon@@ es and en@@ z@@ y@@ mes , and through what nu@@ an@@ ced mole@@ cular me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ?
Se@@ con@@ d , based on these in@@ si@@ ghts , can people make the neces@@ s@@ ary chan@@ ges in their di@@ e@@ ts in a way that &apos;s sa@@ fe and prac@@ tical to imp@@ le@@ ment ?
J@@ ust because you know what to do doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re always going to do it .
So@@ me@@ times we have to put cu@@ es around people to make it e@@ asi@@ er , and believe it or not , that can be stu@@ died scienti@@ fi@@ cally .
I don &apos;t know how this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y is going to end , but this much see@@ ms c@@ lear to me , at le@@ ast : We can &apos;t keep b@@ la@@ ming our over@@ we@@ ight and diabe@@ tic patients like I did .
Mo@@ st of them actually want to do the right thing , but they have to know what that is , and it &apos;s got to work .
Sta@@ ying true to that pa@@ th will be better for our patients and better for science .
If ob@@ es@@ ity is nothing more than a pro@@ x@@ y for meta@@ bo@@ li@@ c ill@@ ness , what good does it do us to pun@@ is@@ h those with the pro@@ x@@ y ?
So@@ me@@ times I think back to that ni@@ ght in the E@@ .@@ R@@ .
se@@ ven years ago .
I wis@@ h I could spe@@ ak with that woman again .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sor@@ ry I am .
You didn &apos;t need my j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment and my con@@ temp@@ t .
You nee@@ ded my em@@ path@@ y and compassion , and ab@@ o@@ ve all else , you nee@@ ded a doc@@ tor who was wi@@ lling to consi@@ der maybe you didn &apos;t let the system down .
Ma@@ ybe the system , of which I was a part , was le@@ tting you down .
If you &apos;re wat@@ ching this now , I hope you can for@@ give me .
( Applause )
This is why we give bon@@ us@@ es to ban@@ kers and pa@@ y in all kinds of ways .
He sta@@ y@@ ed late at ni@@ ght every day .
E@@ very ni@@ ght he was en@@ jo@@ ying his work , he was sta@@ ying late , he was perfec@@ ting this Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ int pres@@ en@@ tation .
And if they said y@@ es , they buil@@ t it .
We basi@@ cally eli@@ min@@ ated it .
So low nu@@ mb@@ ers mean that people worked har@@ der .
And this is basi@@ cally the resul@@ t we had before .
I@@ g@@ nor@@ ing gets you a whole way out there .
What they fi@@ gu@@ red out was that there was not enough ef@@ for@@ t invol@@ ved .
It was so e@@ as@@ y that no@@ body could ser@@ ve ca@@ ke to their gu@@ est@@ s and say , &quot; &quot; Here is my ca@@ ke . &quot; &quot; No , it was somebody else &apos;s ca@@ ke , as if you b@@ ou@@ ght it in the st@@ ore .
They took the e@@ g@@ gs and the mi@@ l@@ k out of the po@@ w@@ der .
Mo@@ st people would say for a lot , a lot of money .
But imagine this was sli@@ gh@@ tly different .
And if you do all 12 ste@@ ps , you care about the p@@ in .
But if you do one ste@@ p every time , maybe you don &apos;t care as much .

This is my great un@@ cle , my fa@@ ther &apos;s fa@@ ther &apos;s youn@@ ger bro@@ ther .
H@@ is name was Jo@@ e M@@ c@@ K@@ en@@ na .
F@@ ami@@ ly hist@@ ory says he lo@@ ved being a fi@@ re@@ man , and so in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , on one of his days off , he elec@@ ted to han@@ g out at the fi@@ re@@ house .
To make hi@@ m@@ self u@@ se@@ ful that day , he started poli@@ sh@@ ing all the bra@@ ss , the ra@@ il@@ ings on the fire tr@@ uc@@ k , the f@@ it@@ t@@ ings on the wal@@ ls , and one of the fire ho@@ se no@@ z@@ z@@ les , a gi@@ ant , he@@ av@@ y piece of me@@ tal , to@@ p@@ p@@ led off a sh@@ el@@ f and h@@ it him .
A few days later , his sh@@ oul@@ der started to h@@ ur@@ t .
T@@ w@@ o days after that , he spi@@ ked a fe@@ ver .
The fe@@ ver cli@@ m@@ bed and cli@@ m@@ bed .
H@@ is wi@@ fe was taking care of him , but nothing she did made a differ@@ ence , and when they got the lo@@ cal doc@@ tor in , nothing he did ma@@ tter@@ ed ei@@ ther .
They f@@ la@@ gg@@ ed down a ca@@ b and took him to the hospital .
The n@@ ur@@ ses there recogni@@ zed right away that he had an infec@@ tion , what at the time they would have called &quot; &quot; blood po@@ is@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and though they probably didn &apos;t say it , they would have kno@@ wn right away that there was nothing they could do .
There was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cur@@ e infec@@ tions didn &apos;t exis@@ t yet .
The first test of pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n , the first antibio@@ tic , was three years in the future .
People who got infec@@ tions ei@@ ther reco@@ vered , if they were l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , or they died .
My great un@@ cle was not l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
He was in the hospital for a wee@@ k , s@@ ha@@ king with ch@@ ill@@ s , de@@ hy@@ dra@@ ted and de@@ li@@ ri@@ ous , sin@@ king into a coma as his org@@ ans fa@@ i@@ led .
H@@ is condi@@ tion gre@@ w so des@@ per@@ ate that the people from his fi@@ re@@ house lin@@ ed up to give him trans@@ fu@@ si@@ ons ho@@ ping to di@@ lu@@ te the infec@@ tion sur@@ ging through his blood .
No@@ thing worked . He died .
He was 30 years old .
If you look back through hist@@ ory , most people died the way my great un@@ cle died .
Mo@@ st people didn &apos;t di@@ e of cancer or heart disease , the li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le dise@@ ases that af@@ fli@@ c@@ t us in the W@@ est today .
They didn &apos;t di@@ e of those dise@@ ases because they didn &apos;t live long enough to develo@@ p them .
All of that chan@@ ged when antibio@@ tics ar@@ ri@@ ved .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , infec@@ tions that had been a death s@@ ent@@ ence became something you reco@@ vered from in days .
It see@@ med like a mi@@ rac@@ le , and ever sin@@ ce , we have been living inside the g@@ ol@@ den e@@ po@@ ch of the mi@@ rac@@ le drugs .
And now , we are coming to an end of it .
My great un@@ cle died in the last days of the pre@@ -@@ antibio@@ tic era .
We st@@ and today on the th@@ res@@ h@@ old of the pos@@ t@@ -@@ antibio@@ tic era , in the ear@@ li@@ est days of a time when simple infec@@ tions such as the one Jo@@ e had will k@@ ill people on@@ ce again .
In fact , they already are .
Bri@@ ef@@ ly , it works like this .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a com@@ pe@@ te aga@@ in@@ st each other for res@@ our@@ ces , for food , by man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing le@@ th@@ al com@@ po@@ unds that they direc@@ t aga@@ in@@ st each other .
O@@ ther bacteria , to protec@@ t themselves , e@@ vol@@ ve defen@@ ses aga@@ in@@ st that che@@ mi@@ cal at@@ ta@@ ck .
When we first made antibio@@ tics , we took those com@@ po@@ unds into the lab and made our own versi@@ ons of them , and bacteria respon@@ ded to our at@@ ta@@ ck the way they always had .
Here is what happened next : Pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n was dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted in 19@@ 4@@ 3 , and wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n resist@@ ance ar@@ ri@@ ved by 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
I@@ mi@@ pen@@ e@@ m in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , and resist@@ ance to in 19@@ 9@@ 8 .
D@@ ap@@ to@@ my@@ ci@@ n , one of the most rec@@ ent drugs , in 200@@ 3 , and resist@@ ance to it just a year later in 200@@ 4 .
For 70 years , we play@@ ed a game of le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g — our drug and their resist@@ ance , and then another drug , and then resist@@ ance again — and now the game is en@@ ding .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a develo@@ p resist@@ ance so qu@@ ick@@ ly that ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ u@@ tical comp@@ ani@@ es have decided making antibio@@ tics is not in their best inter@@ est , so there are infec@@ tions mo@@ ving across the world for which , out of the more than 100 antibio@@ tics a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble on the mar@@ ket , two drugs might work with side effec@@ ts , or one drug , or n@@ one .
This is what that loo@@ ks like .
In 2@@ 000 , the C@@ en@@ ters for D@@ i@@ se@@ ase Con@@ tro@@ l and Pre@@ ven@@ tion , the C@@ D@@ C , identi@@ fi@@ ed a single case in a hospital in Nor@@ th Car@@ ol@@ ina of an infec@@ tion resist@@ ant to all but two drugs .
To@@ day , that infec@@ tion , kno@@ wn as K@@ P@@ C , has s@@ pre@@ ad to every sta@@ te but three , and to S@@ outh America , Europe and the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast .
In 200@@ 8 , doc@@ tors in S@@ we@@ den diagno@@ sed a man from In@@ dia with a different infec@@ tion resist@@ ant to all but one drug that time .
The gene that cre@@ ates that resist@@ ance , kno@@ wn as N@@ D@@ M , has now s@@ pre@@ ad from In@@ dia into Ch@@ ina , A@@ si@@ a , Africa , Europe and Can@@ ada , and the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
It would be natural to hope that these infec@@ tions are extraordin@@ ary ca@@ ses , but in fact , in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes and Europe , 5@@ 0@@ ,000 people a year di@@ e of infec@@ tions which no drugs can help .
A project char@@ ter@@ ed by the Bri@@ ti@@ sh government kno@@ wn as the Re@@ vie@@ w on An@@ ti@@ micro@@ bi@@ al R@@ es@@ ist@@ ance esti@@ ma@@ tes that the wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de to@@ ll right now is 7@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths a year .
That is a lot of de@@ a@@ ths , and yet , the chan@@ ces are good that you don &apos;t feel at ris@@ k , that you imagine these people were hospital patients in inten@@ sive care un@@ its or n@@ ur@@ sing home res@@ id@@ ents ne@@ ar the ends of their lives , people wh@@ ose infec@@ tions are re@@ m@@ ote from us , in situ@@ ations we can &apos;t identi@@ f@@ y with .
What you didn &apos;t think about , n@@ one of us do , is that antibio@@ tics sup@@ port almost all of moder@@ n life .
If we lost antibio@@ tics , here &apos;s what else we &apos;d lo@@ se : F@@ ir@@ st , any protec@@ tion for people with we@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ ed im@@ mun@@ e syste@@ ms — cancer patients , A@@ I@@ D@@ S patients , trans@@ pl@@ ant reci@@ pi@@ ents , pre@@ ma@@ ture bab@@ ies .
N@@ ext , any tre@@ at@@ ment that inst@@ al@@ ls fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n ob@@ jects in the body : st@@ ents for st@@ ro@@ ke , pu@@ mp@@ s for diabe@@ tes , di@@ al@@ y@@ sis , jo@@ int re@@ pl@@ ace@@ ments .
How many a@@ th@@ le@@ tic bab@@ y bo@@ o@@ m@@ ers need new hi@@ ps and k@@ ne@@ es ?
A rec@@ ent study esti@@ ma@@ tes that without antibio@@ tics , one out of ever six would di@@ e .
N@@ ext , we &apos;d probably lo@@ se sur@@ ger@@ y .
M@@ any oper@@ ations are pre@@ ce@@ ded by pro@@ phy@@ l@@ ac@@ tic do@@ ses of antibio@@ tics .
W@@ i@@ th@@ out that protec@@ tion , we &apos;d lo@@ se the ability to open the hi@@ d@@ den sp@@ aces of the body .
So no heart oper@@ ations , no pro@@ sta@@ te bi@@ op@@ si@@ es , no C@@ es@@ are@@ an sec@@ tions .
We &apos;d have to learn to fe@@ ar infec@@ tions that now see@@ m min@@ or .
S@@ tre@@ p th@@ ro@@ at used to cause heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
S@@ k@@ in infec@@ tions led to amp@@ u@@ ta@@ tions .
Gi@@ ving bir@@ th k@@ il@@ led , in the c@@ le@@ an@@ est ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , almost one woman out of every 100 .
P@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia took three children out of every 10 .
Af@@ ter all , the first person to rece@@ i@@ ve pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n , a Bri@@ ti@@ sh poli@@ ce@@ man na@@ med Al@@ ber@@ t A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der , who was so ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed by infec@@ tion that his s@@ cal@@ p oo@@ zed p@@ us and doc@@ tors had to take out an ey@@ e , was infec@@ ted by doing something very simple .
He wal@@ ked into his gar@@ den and s@@ cra@@ t@@ ched his face on a th@@ or@@ n .
That Bri@@ ti@@ sh project I men@@ tion@@ ed which esti@@ ma@@ tes that the wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de to@@ ll right now is 7@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths a year also pre@@ dic@@ ts that if we can &apos;t get this under control by 20@@ 50 , not long , the wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de to@@ ll will be 10 million de@@ a@@ ths a year .
How did we get to this point where what we have to look for@@ ward to is those terri@@ f@@ ying nu@@ mb@@ ers ?
The dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t answer is , we did it to ourselves .
R@@ es@@ ist@@ ance is an in@@ evi@@ table bio@@ logical process , but we be@@ ar the respon@@ si@@ bility for ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating it .
We did this by s@@ qu@@ an@@ der@@ ing antibio@@ tics with a he@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ness that now see@@ ms sho@@ c@@ king .
Pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n was so@@ ld over the coun@@ ter until the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
In much of the develo@@ ping world , most antibio@@ tics still are .
In the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , 50 percent of the antibio@@ tics given in ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als are un@@ neces@@ s@@ ary .
F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent of the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions wri@@ t@@ ten in doc@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ces are for condi@@ tions that antibio@@ tics cannot help .
And that &apos;s just in health@@ care .
O@@ n much of the plan@@ et , most me@@ at animals get antibio@@ tics every day of their lives , not to cur@@ e ill@@ n@@ es@@ ses , but to f@@ at@@ ten them up and to protec@@ t them aga@@ in@@ st the fac@@ t@@ ory far@@ m condi@@ tions they are rai@@ sed in .
In the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , pos@@ si@@ bly 80 percent of the antibio@@ tics so@@ ld every year go to far@@ m animals , not to human@@ s , cre@@ ating resist@@ ant bacteria that move off the far@@ m in water , in d@@ ust , in the me@@ at the animals become .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture depen@@ ds on antibio@@ tics too , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in A@@ si@@ a , and f@@ ru@@ it gro@@ wing reli@@ es on antibio@@ tics to protec@@ t ap@@ pl@@ es , pe@@ ar@@ s , ci@@ tr@@ us , aga@@ in@@ st disease .
And because bacteria can pas@@ s their DNA to each other like a tra@@ vel@@ er han@@ ding off a su@@ it@@ case at an a@@ ir@@ port , on@@ ce we have en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged that resist@@ ance into exist@@ ence , there is no kno@@ wing where it will s@@ pre@@ ad .
This was pre@@ dic@@ table .
In fact , it was pre@@ dic@@ ted by A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ le@@ ming , the man who disco@@ vered pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n .
He was given the No@@ bel Pri@@ ze in 19@@ 4@@ 5 in recogni@@ tion , and in an inter@@ vie@@ w sh@@ or@@ tly after , this is what he said : &quot; &quot; The thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less person pla@@ ying with pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n tre@@ at@@ ment is mor@@ ally respon@@ sible for the death of a man who suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ s to infec@@ tion with a pen@@ ci@@ ll@@ in@@ -@@ resist@@ ant org@@ an@@ ism . &quot; &quot; He ad@@ ded , &quot; &quot; I hope this evi@@ l can be a@@ ver@@ ted . &quot; &quot; C@@ an we a@@ ver@@ t it ?
There are comp@@ ani@@ es working on no@@ vel antibio@@ tics , things the super@@ bu@@ gs have never seen before .
We need those new drugs b@@ ad@@ ly , and we need incen@@ tiv@@ es : disco@@ very gran@@ ts , ex@@ ten@@ ded pa@@ t@@ ents , pri@@ z@@ es , to l@@ ure other comp@@ ani@@ es into making antibio@@ tics again .
But that probably w@@ on &apos;t be enough .
Here &apos;s why : E@@ volu@@ tion always w@@ ins .
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a bir@@ th a new gener@@ ation every 20 minu@@ tes .
It takes ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ u@@ tical che@@ mi@@ stry 10 years to der@@ i@@ ve a new drug .
E@@ very time we use an antibio@@ tic , we give the bacteria bi@@ llions of chan@@ ces to cra@@ ck the co@@ des of the defen@@ ses we &apos;ve con@@ struc@@ ted .
There has never yet been a drug they could not de@@ fe@@ at .
This is as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c war@@ f@@ are , but we can change the out@@ come .
We could build syste@@ ms to har@@ v@@ est data to tell us auto@@ ma@@ tically and speci@@ fi@@ cally how antibio@@ tics are being used .
We could build ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ ping into drug order syste@@ ms so that every pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion gets a second look .
We could re@@ qui@@ re ag@@ ri@@ culture to give up antibio@@ tic use .
We could build sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance syste@@ ms to tell us where resist@@ ance is emer@@ ging next .
Th@@ ose are the te@@ ch solu@@ tions .
They probably ar@@ en &apos;t enough ei@@ ther , un@@ less we help .
An@@ ti@@ bio@@ tic resist@@ ance is a hab@@ it .
We all know how hard it is to change a hab@@ it .
But as a socie@@ ty , we &apos;ve done that in the pa@@ st .
People used to to@@ ss li@@ tter into the st@@ ree@@ ts , used to not we@@ ar se@@ at@@ be@@ l@@ ts , used to s@@ mo@@ ke inside publi@@ c buil@@ d@@ ings .
We don &apos;t do those things any@@ more .
We don &apos;t tra@@ sh the environment or cour@@ t de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents or ex@@ pos@@ e others to the pos@@ si@@ bility of cancer , because we decided those things were ex@@ pen@@ sive , dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tive , not in our best inter@@ est .
We chan@@ ged social nor@@ ms .
We could change social nor@@ ms around antibio@@ tic use too .
I know that the s@@ cal@@ e of antibio@@ tic resist@@ ance see@@ ms over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming , but if you &apos;ve ever b@@ ou@@ ght a f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ gh@@ t@@ bul@@ b because you were con@@ cer@@ ned about climate change , or read the la@@ bel on a bo@@ x of cra@@ c@@ kers because you think about the de@@ for@@ esta@@ tion from pal@@ m oil , you already know what it fe@@ els like to take a tin@@ y ste@@ p to ad@@ d@@ ress an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming problem .
We could take those kinds of ste@@ ps for antibio@@ tic use too .
We could for@@ go gi@@ ving an antibio@@ tic if we &apos;re not sure it &apos;s the right one .
We could stop in@@ si@@ st@@ ing on a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for our kid &apos;s e@@ ar infec@@ tion before we &apos;re sure what ca@@ used it .
We could ask every res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , every super@@ mar@@ ket , where their me@@ at comes from .
We could pro@@ mi@@ se each other never again to bu@@ y ch@@ ic@@ ken or sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p or f@@ ru@@ it rai@@ sed with rou@@ t@@ ine antibio@@ tic use , and if we did those things , we could s@@ low down the ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of the pos@@ t@@ -@@ antibio@@ tic world .
But we have to do it so@@ on .
Pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n beg@@ an the antibio@@ tic era in 19@@ 4@@ 3 .
In just 70 years , we wal@@ ked ourselves up to the e@@ dge of disa@@ s@@ ter .
We w@@ on &apos;t get 70 years to find our way back out again .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you very much .
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wi@@ fe T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ly , we mo@@ ved to L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles — ( Laughter ) thinking we were mo@@ ving to America , but any@@ way — ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a sh@@ or@@ t plan@@ e ri@@ de from L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles to America . ( Laughter )
I got here 12 years ago , and when I got here , I was told vari@@ ous things , like , &quot; &quot; Amer@@ ic@@ ans don &apos;t get i@@ ron@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Ha@@ ve you come across this idea ?
It &apos;s not true .
I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led the whole l@@ eng@@ th and bre@@ ad@@ th of this country .
I have found no evi@@ den@@ ce that Amer@@ ic@@ ans don &apos;t get i@@ ron@@ y .
We &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
You know , so when you lea@@ ve living roo@@ ms in Europe , people say , th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly , no@@ body was i@@ ro@@ ni@@ c in your pres@@ ence .
( Laughter ) But I knew that Amer@@ ic@@ ans get i@@ ron@@ y when I came across that le@@ g@@ is@@ lation , &quot; &quot; No Ch@@ il@@ d L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hind . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because who@@ ever thought of that ti@@ t@@ le gets i@@ ron@@ y . ( Laughter )
D@@ on &apos;t they ?
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s lea@@ ving mi@@ llions of children be@@ hind .
Now I can see that &apos;s not a very at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive name for le@@ g@@ is@@ lation : &quot; M@@ il@@ li@@ ons of Ch@@ il@@ dren L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hind . &quot;
I can see that .
What &apos;s the pla@@ n ?
We pro@@ pos@@ e to lea@@ ve mi@@ llions of children be@@ hind , and here &apos;s how it &apos;s going to work .
And it &apos;s working beauti@@ ful@@ ly .
If we hal@@ ved that number , one esti@@ mate is it would create a net ga@@ in to the U.@@ S@@ . econo@@ my over 10 years , of ne@@ ar@@ ly a tri@@ llion dollars .
It actually co@@ sts an enor@@ mous amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ ma@@ ge from the dro@@ po@@ ut cri@@ sis .
But the dro@@ po@@ ut cri@@ sis is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g .
What it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t are all the kids who are in school but being di@@ sen@@ g@@ ag@@ ed from it , who don &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y it , who don &apos;t get any real ben@@ ef@@ it from it .
And the reason is not that we &apos;re not s@@ pen@@ ding enough money .
America s@@ pen@@ ds more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ la@@ ss si@@ z@@ es are s@@ mal@@ ler than in many countries .
And there are hundre@@ ds of ini@@ ti@@ a@@ tiv@@ es every year to try and impro@@ ve education .
The t@@ rou@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion .
The first is this , that human be@@ ings are n@@ atur@@ ally different and diver@@ se .
C@@ an I ask you , how many of you have got children of your own ?
Okay . O@@ r gran@@ d@@ children .
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the res@@ t of you have seen such children .
( Laughter ) S@@ mall people wan@@ der@@ ing about . ( Laughter )
I will make you a be@@ t , and I am confi@@ d@@ ent that I will w@@ in the be@@ t .
If you &apos;ve got two children or more , I be@@ t you they are comple@@ tely different from each other .
A@@ ren &apos;t they ?
( Applause ) You would never con@@ f@@ use them , would you ?
Li@@ ke , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich one are you ? Re@@ mind me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Y@@ our mother and I need some col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ding system so we don &apos;t get con@@ fu@@ sed . &quot; &quot; E@@ du@@ cation under &quot; &quot; No Ch@@ il@@ d L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hind &quot; &quot; is based on not diversi@@ ty but con@@ for@@ mi@@ ty .
What s@@ cho@@ ols are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very n@@ ar@@ row spec@@ tru@@ m of ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment .
One of the effec@@ ts of &quot; &quot; No Ch@@ il@@ d L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hind &quot; &quot; has been to n@@ ar@@ row the fo@@ c@@ us on@@ to the so@@ -@@ called S@@ TE@@ M dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ es .
They &apos;re very important .
A real education has to give equ@@ al we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the human@@ i@@ ties , to physical education .
A@@ n aw@@ ful lot of kids , sor@@ ry , th@@ ank you — ( Applause ) One esti@@ mate in America cur@@ r@@ ently is that something like 10 percent of kids , getting on that way , are being diagno@@ sed with vari@@ ous condi@@ tions under the bro@@ ad ti@@ t@@ le of attention de@@ fici@@ t dis@@ order .
AD@@ H@@ D .
I &apos;m not saying there &apos;s no such thing .
I just don &apos;t believe it &apos;s an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic like this .
If you si@@ t kids down , h@@ our after h@@ our , doing low@@ -@@ gra@@ de c@@ ler@@ i@@ cal work , don &apos;t be sur@@ pri@@ sed if they start to fi@@ d@@ get , you know ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ch@@ il@@ dren are not , for the most part , suf@@ fer@@ ing from a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical condi@@ tion .
They &apos;re suf@@ fer@@ ing from chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
( Laughter ) And I know this because I sp@@ ent my early life as a child .
K@@ i@@ ds pro@@ sp@@ er best with a bro@@ ad cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um that ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tes their vari@@ ous tal@@ ents , not just a small ran@@ ge of them .
And by the way , the ar@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t just important because they impro@@ ve ma@@ th s@@ cor@@ es .
The second , th@@ ank you — ( Applause ) The second princi@@ ple that dri@@ ves human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing is curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
If you can light the s@@ par@@ k of curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty in a child , they will learn without any f@@ ur@@ ther as@@ si@@ st@@ ance , very of@@ ten .
Ch@@ il@@ dren are natural lear@@ n@@ ers .
It &apos;s a real ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment to put that particular ability out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ si@@ ty is the eng@@ ine of ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment .
Now the reason I say this is because one of the effec@@ ts of the cur@@ r@@ ent culture here , if I can say so , has been to de@@ -@@ profes@@ sion@@ aliz@@ e teachers .
There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers are the li@@ fe@@ blood of the suc@@ cess of s@@ cho@@ ols .
But teach@@ ing is a crea@@ tive profes@@ sion .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing , pro@@ per@@ ly con@@ ce@@ i@@ ved , is not a de@@ li@@ very system .
You know , you &apos;re not there just to pas@@ s on rece@@ i@@ ved information .
Gre@@ at teachers do that , but what great teachers also do is men@@ tor , sti@@ mu@@ late , provo@@ ke , eng@@ age .
You see , in the end , education is about learning .
If there &apos;s no learning going on , there &apos;s no education going on .
A@@ n old fri@@ end of min@@ e — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s as old as it gets , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id . ( Laughter )
But a wonderful guy he was , wonderful phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er .
He used to talk about the differ@@ ence between the tas@@ k and ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment sen@@ ses of ver@@ b@@ s .
You can be eng@@ ag@@ ed in the activi@@ ty of something , but not really be ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ving it , like di@@ e@@ ting .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very good example .
I@@ s he lo@@ sing any we@@ ight ? No@@ t really .
You can say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s De@@ bor@@ ah , she &apos;s in room 3@@ 4 , she &apos;s teach@@ ing . &quot; &quot; But if no@@ body &apos;s learning anything , she may be eng@@ ag@@ ed in the tas@@ k of teach@@ ing but not actually ful@@ fi@@ lling it .
The ro@@ le of a teach@@ er is to faci@@ li@@ ta@@ te learning .
That &apos;s it .
And part of the problem is , I think , that the do@@ min@@ ant culture of education has come to fo@@ c@@ us on not teach@@ ing and learning , but t@@ esting .
But they should not be the do@@ min@@ ant culture of education .
They should be diagno@@ stic . They should help .
( Applause ) If I go for a medical ex@@ a@@ min@@ ation , I want some stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed t@@ est@@ s .
I do .
I want to know what my ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol level is compar@@ ed to every@@ body else &apos;s on a stan@@ d@@ ard s@@ cal@@ e .
But all that should sup@@ port learning .
It sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t ob@@ struc@@ t it , which of course it of@@ ten does .
So in place of curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance .
Ou@@ r children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged to fol@@ low rou@@ t@@ ine alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms ra@@ ther than to exci@@ te that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
And the th@@ ird princi@@ ple is this : that human life is in@@ her@@ ently crea@@ tive .
It &apos;s why we all have different r@@ é@@ su@@ m@@ és .
We create our lives , and we can re@@ create them as we go through them .
It &apos;s the common cur@@ ren@@ cy of being a human being .
It &apos;s why human culture is so interesting and diver@@ se and dy@@ na@@ mic .
I mean , other animals may well have imag@@ in@@ ations and crea@@ tivi@@ ty , but it &apos;s not so much in evi@@ den@@ ce , is it , as our@@ s ?
I mean , you may have a do@@ g .
And your do@@ g may get depres@@ sed .
You know , but it doesn &apos;t li@@ ste@@ n to R@@ adi@@ o@@ head , does it ?
( Laughter ) And si@@ t star@@ ing out the win@@ do@@ w with a bot@@ t@@ le of J@@ ack D@@ ani@@ els . ( Laughter )
&quot; W@@ ould you like to come for a wal@@ k ? &quot;
&quot; No , I &apos;m fin@@ e . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; You go . I &apos;ll wa@@ it . But take pic@@ tures . &quot; ( Laughter )
In@@ stead , what we have is a culture of stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .
It really doesn &apos;t .
Fin@@ land re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly comes out on top in ma@@ th , science and read@@ ing .
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
They don &apos;t look for other things that matter just as much .
The thing about work in Fin@@ land is this : they don &apos;t ob@@ s@@ ess about those dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ es .
They have a very bro@@ ad appro@@ ach to education , which inclu@@ des human@@ i@@ ties , physical education , the ar@@ ts .
Se@@ con@@ d , there is no stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed t@@ esting in Fin@@ land .
And they all looked a bit be@@ mu@@ sed , and said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have one .
If people are in t@@ rou@@ ble , we get to them quite qu@@ ick@@ ly and we help and sup@@ port them . &quot; &quot; Now people always say , &quot; Well , you know , you can &apos;t compar@@ e Fin@@ land to America . &quot;
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in Fin@@ land .
But you can compar@@ e it to a sta@@ te in America .
M@@ any sta@@ tes in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
I mean , I &apos;ve been to some sta@@ tes in America and I was the only person there .
( Laughter ) Re@@ ally . Re@@ ally .
I was asked to lo@@ ck up when I left .
( Laughter ) But what all the high@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ ming syste@@ ms in the world do is cur@@ r@@ ently what is not evi@@ d@@ ent , sa@@ d@@ ly , across the syste@@ ms in America — I mean , as a whole .
One is this : they individu@@ aliz@@ e teach@@ ing and learning .
They recogni@@ ze that it &apos;s stud@@ ents who are learning and the system has to eng@@ age them , their curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty , their individu@@ ality , and their crea@@ tivi@@ ty .
That &apos;s how you get them to learn .
The second is that they at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te a very high sta@@ tu@@ s to the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
They recogni@@ ze that you can &apos;t impro@@ ve education if you don &apos;t pic@@ k great people to te@@ ach and keep gi@@ ving them con@@ st@@ ant sup@@ port and profes@@ sion@@ al develo@@ p@@ ment .
In@@ v@@ esting in profes@@ sion@@ al develo@@ p@@ ment is not a co@@ st .
It &apos;s an inv@@ est@@ ment , and every other country that &apos;s suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding well kno@@ ws that , whether it &apos;s Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , Can@@ ada , S@@ outh K@@ o@@ rea , S@@ ing@@ a@@ po@@ re , H@@ ong K@@ ong or S@@ han@@ g@@ hai .
They know that to be the case .
You see , there &apos;s a big differ@@ ence here between going into a mo@@ de of com@@ m@@ and and control in education — That &apos;s what happens in some syste@@ ms .
C@@ ent@@ ral or sta@@ te govern@@ ments deci@@ de , they know best and they &apos;re going to tell you what to do .
The t@@ rou@@ ble is that education doesn &apos;t go on in the com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e roo@@ ms of our le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive buil@@ d@@ ings .
It happens in cla@@ s@@ s@@ roo@@ ms and s@@ cho@@ ols , and the people who do it are the teachers and the stud@@ ents , and if you re@@ move their dis@@ cre@@ tion , it st@@ op@@ s working .
You have to put it back to the people .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
And the reason I think is this : that many of the cur@@ r@@ ent poli@@ ci@@ es are based on me@@ chan@@ is@@ tic concep@@ tions of education .
It &apos;s like education is an industri@@ al process that can be impro@@ ved just by having better data , and some@@ where in the back of the mind of some poli@@ cy ma@@ kers is this idea that if we fin@@ e@@ -@@ tun@@ e it well enough , if we just get it right , it will all hu@@ m al@@ ong perfec@@ tly into the future .
It w@@ on &apos;t , and it never did .
The point is that education is not a me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal system .
It &apos;s a human system .
It &apos;s about people , people who ei@@ ther do want to learn or don &apos;t want to learn .
E@@ very stud@@ ent who dro@@ ps out of school has a reason for it which is roo@@ ted in their own bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They may find it ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
They may find that it &apos;s at o@@ d@@ ds with the life they &apos;re living out@@ side of school .
There are tr@@ ends , but the stories are always uni@@ que .
I was at a me@@ e@@ ting rec@@ ently in L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles of — they &apos;re called alter@@ na@@ tive education progra@@ ms .
These are progra@@ ms desig@@ ned to get kids back into education .
They have cer@@ tain common fe@@ atur@@ es .
They &apos;re very person@@ aliz@@ ed .
They have st@@ rong sup@@ port for the teachers , clo@@ se lin@@ ks with the commun@@ ity and a bro@@ ad and diver@@ se cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , and of@@ ten progra@@ ms which invol@@ ve stud@@ ents out@@ side school as well as inside school .
And they work .
What &apos;s interesting to me is , these are called &quot; &quot; alter@@ na@@ tive education . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know ?
And all the evi@@ den@@ ce from around the world is , if we all did that , there &apos;d be no need for the alter@@ na@@ tive .
( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) So I think we have to em@@ bra@@ ce a different meta@@ ph@@ or .
We have to recogni@@ ze that it &apos;s a human system , and there are condi@@ tions under which people th@@ ri@@ ve , and condi@@ tions under which they don &apos;t .
We are after all organi@@ c cre@@ atur@@ es , and the culture of the school is absolu@@ tely es@@ senti@@ al .
C@@ ul@@ ture is an organi@@ c ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?
No@@ t far from where I live is a place called De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y .
De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y is the h@@ ot@@ test , dri@@ est place in America , and nothing gro@@ ws there .
No@@ thing gro@@ ws there because it doesn &apos;t ra@@ in .
H@@ ence , De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y .
In the win@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ in@@ ed in De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y .
S@@ even in@@ ches of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ od .
And in the s@@ pr@@ ing of 200@@ 5 , there was a ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on .
The whole flo@@ or of De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y was car@@ pe@@ ted in f@@ low@@ ers for a while .
What it pro@@ ved is this : that De@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y isn &apos;t de@@ ad .
It &apos;s d@@ or@@ man@@ t .
R@@ ight ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face are these see@@ ds of pos@@ si@@ bility wa@@ it@@ ing for the right condi@@ tions to come about , and with organi@@ c syste@@ ms , if the condi@@ tions are right , life is in@@ evi@@ table .
It happens all the time .
Gre@@ at lea@@ ders know that .
The real ro@@ le of lea@@ der@@ ship in education — and I think it &apos;s true at the national level , the sta@@ te level , at the school level — is not and should not be com@@ m@@ and and control .
The real ro@@ le of lea@@ der@@ ship is climate control , cre@@ ating a climate of pos@@ si@@ bility .
And if you do that , people will ri@@ se to it and ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve things that you comple@@ tely did not anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te and coul@@ dn &apos;t have expec@@ ted .
There &apos;s a wonderful quot@@ e from B@@ en@@ j@@ a@@ min Fran@@ k@@ li@@ n .
And if the mo@@ ve@@ ment is st@@ rong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ volu@@ tion .
And that &apos;s what we need .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You think I &apos;ve lost my way , and somebody &apos;s going to come on the sta@@ ge in a minu@@ te and gu@@ i@@ de me g@@ ently back to my se@@ at .
( Applause ) I get that all the time in D@@ u@@ ba@@ i .
&quot; Here on ho@@ li@@ day are you , de@@ ar ? &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Co@@ me to visi@@ t the children ?
How long are you sta@@ ying ? &quot; &quot; Well actually , I hope for a while lon@@ ger yet .
I have been living and teach@@ ing in the G@@ ul@@ f for over 30 years .
( Applause ) And in that time , I have seen a lot of chan@@ ges .
Now that sta@@ ti@@ stic is quite sho@@ c@@ king .
And I want to talk to you today about language lo@@ ss and the glob@@ aliz@@ ation of English .
I want to tell you about my fri@@ end who was teach@@ ing English to adul@@ ts in A@@ b@@ u D@@ hab@@ i .
And one fin@@ e day , she decided to take them into the gar@@ den to te@@ ach them some n@@ ature vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ary .
But it was she who en@@ ded up learning all the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c words for the lo@@ cal plan@@ ts , as well as their us@@ es — medi@@ cin@@ al us@@ es , co@@ s@@ me@@ tics , co@@ o@@ king , her@@ b@@ al .
How did those stud@@ ents get all that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ?
O@@ f course , from their gran@@ d@@ parents and even their gre@@ at@@ -@@ gran@@ d@@ parents .
It &apos;s not neces@@ s@@ ary to tell you how important it is to be able to communi@@ cate across gener@@ ations .
But sa@@ d@@ ly , today , langu@@ ages are d@@ ying at an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted rate .
A language dies every 1@@ 4 days .
Now , at the same time , English is the un@@ dis@@ pu@@ ted global language .
C@@ ould there be a connec@@ tion ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
But I do know that I &apos;ve seen a lot of chan@@ ges .
When I first came out to the G@@ ul@@ f , I came to K@@ u@@ wa@@ it in the days when it was still a har@@ d@@ ship pos@@ t .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , I was rec@@ ru@@ i@@ ted by the Bri@@ ti@@ sh Co@@ un@@ cil , al@@ ong with about 25 other teachers .
And we were the first n@@ on-@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ ms to te@@ ach in the sta@@ te s@@ cho@@ ols there in K@@ u@@ wa@@ it .
We were b@@ rou@@ ght to te@@ ach English because the government wanted to moder@@ ni@@ ze the country and to em@@ power the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens through education .
And of course , the U.@@ K@@ . ben@@ e@@ fi@@ ted from some of that lo@@ vely oil we@@ al@@ th .
Okay .
Now this is the ma@@ j@@ or change that I &apos;ve seen — how teach@@ ing English has mor@@ ph@@ ed from being a mu@@ tu@@ ally ben@@ efici@@ al prac@@ tice to be@@ coming a mas@@ sive inter@@ national bus@@ in@@ ess that it is today .
No lon@@ ger just a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n language on the school cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , and no lon@@ ger the so@@ le do@@ ma@@ in of mother En@@ g@@ land , it has become a ban@@ d@@ w@@ ag@@ on for every Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ spe@@ a@@ king na@@ tion on ear@@ th .
And why not ?
Af@@ ter all , the best education — ac@@ cor@@ ding to the la@@ test W@@ or@@ ld Uni@@ versi@@ ty R@@ an@@ k@@ ings — is to be found in the uni@@ versi@@ ties of the U.@@ K@@ . and the U.@@ S@@ .
So every@@ body wan@@ ts to have an English education , n@@ atur@@ ally .
But if you &apos;re not a na@@ tive spe@@ a@@ ker , you have to pas@@ s a test .
Now can it be right to re@@ ject a stud@@ ent on lingu@@ is@@ tic ability al@@ one ?
Per@@ haps you have a computer scienti@@ st who &apos;s a gen@@ i@@ us .
W@@ ould he need the same language as a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , for example ?
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers re@@ ject them all the time .
We put a stop si@@ g@@ n , and we stop them in their tra@@ c@@ ks .
They can &apos;t pur@@ su@@ e their dre@@ am any lon@@ ger , &apos; til they get English .
Now let me put it this way : if I me@@ t a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al D@@ u@@ t@@ ch spe@@ a@@ ker who had the cur@@ e for cancer , would I stop him from en@@ ter@@ ing my Bri@@ ti@@ sh Uni@@ versi@@ ty ?
I don &apos;t think so .
But in@@ de@@ ed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s .
And you have to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y us first that your English is good enough .
Now it can be dan@@ ger@@ ous to give too much power to a n@@ ar@@ row se@@ g@@ ment of socie@@ ty .
Ma@@ ybe the bar@@ ri@@ er would be too univer@@ sa@@ l .
Okay .
&quot; &quot; But , &quot; &quot; I he@@ ar you say , &quot; &quot; what about the research ?
It &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So the bo@@ o@@ ks are in English , the j@@ our@@ n@@ als are done in English , but that is a sel@@ f-@@ ful@@ fi@@ lling pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y .
It fe@@ e@@ ds the English re@@ qui@@ re@@ ment .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to trans@@ lation ?
If you think about the Is@@ la@@ mic G@@ ol@@ den A@@ ge , there was l@@ ots of trans@@ lation then .
They trans@@ la@@ ted from L@@ a@@ ti@@ n and G@@ ree@@ k into A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , into Per@@ si@@ an , and then it was trans@@ la@@ ted on into the G@@ er@@ man@@ ic langu@@ ages of Europe and the R@@ o@@ man@@ ce langu@@ ages .
And so light sh@@ one u@@ po@@ n the D@@ ar@@ k Ag@@ es of Europe .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong ; I am not aga@@ in@@ st teach@@ ing English , all you English teachers out there .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am aga@@ in@@ st using it as a bar@@ ri@@ er .
D@@ o we really want to end up with 6@@ 00 langu@@ ages and the ma@@ in one being English , or Ch@@ in@@ ese ?
We need more than that . Wh@@ ere do we dra@@ w the line ?
This system equ@@ ates inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce with a kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of English , which is quite ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary .
( Applause ) And I want to re@@ mind you that the gi@@ an@@ ts u@@ po@@ n wh@@ ose sh@@ oul@@ ders today &apos;s inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent@@ si@@ a st@@ and did not have to have English , they didn &apos;t have to pas@@ s an English test .
C@@ ase in point , E@@ in@@ ste@@ in .
He , by the way , was consider@@ ed re@@ medi@@ al at school because he was , in fact , dy@@ s@@ le@@ xi@@ c .
But for@@ tun@@ ately for the world , he did not have to pas@@ s an English test .
Because they didn &apos;t start until 19@@ 6@@ 4 with T@@ O@@ E@@ F@@ L , the Ameri@@ can test of English .
Now it &apos;s ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ded .
There are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of t@@ est@@ s of English .
And mi@@ llions and mi@@ llions of stud@@ ents take these t@@ est@@ s every year .
Now you might think , you and me , &quot; Th@@ ose fe@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t bad , they &apos;re o@@ kay , &quot; but they are pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tive to so many mi@@ llions of po@@ or people .
So im@@ medi@@ ately , we &apos;re re@@ jec@@ ting them .
( Applause ) It br@@ ings to mind a he@@ ad@@ line I saw rec@@ ently : &quot; E@@ du@@ cation : The Gre@@ at D@@ i@@ vi@@ de . &quot;
Now I get it , I understand why people would want to fo@@ c@@ us on English .
They want to give their children the best chan@@ ce in life .
And to do that , they need a W@@ est@@ er@@ n education .
Because , of course , the best j@@ ob@@ s go to people out of the W@@ est@@ er@@ n Uni@@ versi@@ ties , that I put on ear@@ li@@ er .
It &apos;s a cir@@ cular thing .
Okay .
Let me tell you a story about two scienti@@ sts , two English scienti@@ sts .
They were doing an experi@@ ment to do with gene@@ tics and the fo@@ reli@@ mb@@ s and the hind li@@ mb@@ s of animals .
But they coul@@ dn &apos;t get the resul@@ ts they wanted .
They really didn &apos;t know what to do , until al@@ ong came a G@@ er@@ man scienti@@ st who realiz@@ ed that they were using two words for fo@@ reli@@ m@@ b and hind li@@ m@@ b , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as gene@@ tics does not differ@@ enti@@ ate and ne@@ i@@ ther does G@@ er@@ man .
So bin@@ go , problem sol@@ ved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are st@@ uc@@ k .
But if another language can think that thought , then , by co@@ oper@@ ating , we can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve and learn so much more .
My da@@ u@@ ghter came to En@@ g@@ land from K@@ u@@ wa@@ it .
She had stu@@ died science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c .
It &apos;s an A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic@@ -@@ medi@@ um school .
She had to trans@@ late it into English at her gra@@ m@@ mar school .
And she was the best in the cla@@ ss at those sub@@ jects .
Wh@@ ich te@@ lls us that when stud@@ ents come to us from ab@@ ro@@ ad , we may not be gi@@ ving them enough cre@@ di@@ t for what they know , and they know it in their own language .
When a language dies , we don &apos;t know what we lo@@ se with that language .
This is — I don &apos;t know if you saw it on C@@ N@@ N rec@@ ently — they ga@@ ve the H@@ er@@ o@@ es A@@ ward to a young K@@ en@@ y@@ an s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y who coul@@ dn &apos;t study at ni@@ ght in his vi@@ l@@ la@@ ge , like all the vi@@ l@@ la@@ ge children , because the k@@ er@@ o@@ sen@@ e la@@ m@@ p , it had s@@ mo@@ ke and it da@@ ma@@ ged his eyes .
And any@@ way , there was never enough k@@ er@@ o@@ sen@@ e , because what does a dol@@ lar a day bu@@ y for you ?
So he in@@ ven@@ ted a co@@ st@@ -@@ f@@ ree solar la@@ m@@ p .
And now the children in his vi@@ l@@ la@@ ge get the same gra@@ des at school as the children who have elec@@ tri@@ city at home .
( Applause ) When he rece@@ i@@ ved his aw@@ ard , he said these lo@@ vely words : &quot; &quot; The children can le@@ ad Africa from what it is today , a dar@@ k contin@@ ent , to a light contin@@ ent . &quot; &quot; A simple idea , but it could have such far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing conse@@ quen@@ ces .
People who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or meta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal , cannot pas@@ s our ex@@ a@@ ms , and we can never know what they know .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dar@@ k .
Let us ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te diversi@@ ty .
M@@ ind your language .
U@@ se it to s@@ pre@@ ad great ideas .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
I &apos;m spe@@ a@@ king about compassion from an Is@@ la@@ mic point of vie@@ w , and per@@ haps my fa@@ ith is not very well thought of as being one that is gro@@ un@@ ded in compassion .
The tru@@ th of the matter is o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se .
Ou@@ r ho@@ ly book , the K@@ or@@ an , consi@@ sts of 1@@ 1@@ 4 cha@@ p@@ ters , and each cha@@ p@@ ter beg@@ ins with what we call the bas@@ mal@@ a , the saying of &quot; &quot; In the name of God , the all compas@@ sion@@ ate , the all mer@@ ci@@ ful , &quot; &quot; or , as S@@ ir R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ur@@ ton — not the R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ur@@ ton who was mar@@ ri@@ ed to E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ta@@ y@@ l@@ or , but the S@@ ir R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ur@@ ton who li@@ ved a cent@@ ur@@ y before that and who was a wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de tra@@ vel@@ er and trans@@ la@@ tor of many works of liter@@ ature — trans@@ la@@ tes it . &quot; &quot; In the name of God , the compas@@ sion@@ ating , the compas@@ sion@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And in a saying of the K@@ or@@ an , which to M@@ us@@ li@@ ms is God spe@@ a@@ king to human@@ ity , God says to his pro@@ p@@ he@@ t Mu@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d —
who@@ m we believe to be the last of a seri@@ es of pro@@ p@@ he@@ ts , beg@@ in@@ ning with A@@ da@@ m , inclu@@ ding No@@ ah , inclu@@ ding Mo@@ ses , inclu@@ ding A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m , inclu@@ ding J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st , and en@@ ding with Mu@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d — that , &quot; &quot; We have not s@@ ent you , O Mu@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d , ex@@ cep@@ t as a &apos; ra@@ h@@ ma@@ h , &apos; ex@@ cep@@ t as a s@@ our@@ ce of compassion to human@@ ity . &quot; &quot; For us human be@@ ings , and cer@@ tain@@ ly for us as M@@ us@@ li@@ ms , wh@@ ose mis@@ sion , and wh@@ ose pur@@ pos@@ e in fol@@ lo@@ wing the pa@@ th of the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t is to make ourselves as much like the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t .
And the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t , in one of his sa@@ y@@ ings , said , &quot; A@@ d@@ or@@ n your@@ selves with the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of God . &quot;
And because God H@@ im@@ self said that the pri@@ mar@@ y at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te of his is compassion — in fact , the K@@ or@@ an says that &quot; &quot; God de@@ cre@@ ed u@@ po@@ n hi@@ m@@ self compassion , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; re@@ ig@@ ned hi@@ m@@ self in by compassion &quot; &quot; — ther@@ e@@ fore , our ob@@ jec@@ tive and our mis@@ sion must be to be s@@ our@@ ces of compassion , activ@@ at@@ ors of compassion , ac@@ tors of compassion and spe@@ a@@ kers of compassion and do@@ ers of compassion .
That is all well and good , but where do we go wrong , and what is the s@@ our@@ ce of the lack of compassion in the world ?
For the answer to this , we turn to our spi@@ ri@@ tual pa@@ th .
In every reli@@ gi@@ ous tradi@@ tion , there is the ou@@ ter pa@@ th and the in@@ ner pa@@ th , or the ex@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pa@@ th and the es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pa@@ th .
The es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pa@@ th of Is@@ la@@ m is more po@@ pul@@ ar@@ ly kno@@ wn as Su@@ fi@@ s@@ m , or &quot; &quot; ta@@ sa@@ w@@ w@@ u@@ f &quot; &quot; in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c .
And these doc@@ tors or these ma@@ st@@ ers , these spi@@ ri@@ tual ma@@ st@@ ers of the Su@@ f@@ i tradi@@ tion , ref@@ er to teach@@ ings and examp@@ les of our pro@@ p@@ he@@ t that te@@ ach us where the s@@ our@@ ce of our problems li@@ es .
In one of the bat@@ t@@ les that the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t w@@ ag@@ ed , he told his fol@@ low@@ ers , &quot; &quot; We are re@@ tur@@ ning from the l@@ es@@ ser w@@ ar to the gre@@ ater w@@ ar , to the gre@@ ater bat@@ t@@ le . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; M@@ es@@ sen@@ ger of God , we are bat@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ w@@ ear@@ y .
How can we go to a gre@@ ater bat@@ t@@ le ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; That is the bat@@ t@@ le of the self , the bat@@ t@@ le of the e@@ go . &quot; &quot; The s@@ our@@ ces of human problems have to do with e@@ go@@ tis@@ m , &quot; &quot; I@@ . &quot; &quot; The fa@@ mous Su@@ f@@ i mas@@ ter R@@ u@@ m@@ i , who is very well kno@@ wn to most of you , has a story in which he tal@@ ks of a man who goes to the house of a fri@@ end , and he kno@@ c@@ ks on the do@@ or , and a vo@@ ice ans@@ w@@ ers , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o &apos;s there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s me , &quot; or , more gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tically correc@@ tly , &quot; It is I , &quot; as we might say in English .
The vo@@ ice says , &quot; &quot; G@@ o away . &quot; &quot; Af@@ ter many years of tra@@ in@@ ing , of dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ing , of se@@ ar@@ ch and stru@@ gg@@ le , he comes back .
W@@ ith much gre@@ ater hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty , he kno@@ c@@ ks again on the do@@ or .
The vo@@ ice as@@ ks , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is there ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It is you , O hear@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ ker . &quot; &quot; The do@@ or s@@ w@@ ings open , and the vo@@ ice says , &quot; Co@@ me in , for there is no room in this house for two I &apos;s , &quot; — two ca@@ pi@@ tal I &apos;s , not these eyes — &quot; &quot; for two e@@ gos . &quot; &quot; And R@@ u@@ m@@ i &apos;s stories are meta@@ ph@@ ors for the spi@@ ri@@ tual pa@@ th .
In the pres@@ ence of God , there is no room for more than one &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and that is the &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; of di@@ vin@@ ity .
In a teach@@ ing — called a &quot; &quot; ha@@ di@@ th qu@@ d@@ si &quot; &quot; in our tradi@@ tion — God says that , &quot; &quot; My ser@@ v@@ ant , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; My cre@@ ature , my human cre@@ ature , does not appro@@ ach me by anything that is de@@ ar@@ er to me than what I have asked them to do . &quot; &quot; And those of you who are emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers know exactly what I mean .
You want your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es to do what you ask them to do , and if they &apos;ve done that , then they can do ex@@ tra .
But don &apos;t ig@@ nor@@ e what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
&quot; &quot; And , &quot; &quot; God says , &quot; &quot; my ser@@ v@@ ant continu@@ es to get ne@@ ar@@ er to me , by doing more of what I &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; &quot; — ex@@ tra cre@@ di@@ t , we might call it — &quot; &quot; until I love him or love her .
And when I love my ser@@ v@@ ant , &quot; &quot; God says , &quot; &quot; I become the eyes by which he or she se@@ es , the ear@@ s by which he or she list@@ ens , the hand by which he or she gra@@ sp@@ s , and the fo@@ o@@ t by which he or she wal@@ ks , and the heart by which he or she underst@@ an@@ ds . &quot; &quot; It is this mer@@ ging of our self with di@@ vin@@ ity that is the l@@ es@@ son and pur@@ pos@@ e of our spi@@ ri@@ tual pa@@ th and all of our fa@@ ith tradi@@ tions .
M@@ us@@ li@@ ms re@@ gar@@ d J@@ es@@ us as the mas@@ ter of Su@@ fi@@ s@@ m , the gre@@ at@@ est pro@@ p@@ he@@ t and mes@@ sen@@ ger who came to emp@@ ha@@ size the spi@@ ri@@ tual pa@@ th .
When he says , &quot; &quot; I am the spi@@ ri@@ t , and I am the way , &quot; &quot; and when the pro@@ p@@ he@@ t Mu@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ ever has seen me has seen God , &quot; &quot; it is because they became so much an instru@@ ment of God , they became part of God &apos;s te@@ am — so that God &apos;s will was man@@ i@@ f@@ est through them , and they were not ac@@ ting from their own selves and their own e@@ gos .
Co@@ m@@ pas@@ sion on ear@@ th is given , it is in us .
All we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tis@@ m out of the way .
I &apos;m sure , probably all of you here , or cer@@ tain@@ ly the very v@@ ast ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of you , have had what you might call a spi@@ ri@@ tual experience , a moment in your lives when , for a few secon@@ ds , a minu@@ te per@@ haps , the bo@@ und@@ ari@@ es of your e@@ go dis@@ sol@@ ved .
And at that minu@@ te , you fel@@ t at one with the universe — one with that j@@ u@@ g of water , one with every human being , one with the Cre@@ at@@ or — and you fel@@ t you were in the pres@@ ence of power , of a@@ we , of the de@@ e@@ p@@ est love , the de@@ e@@ p@@ est sense of compassion and mer@@ cy that you have ever experi@@ en@@ ced in your lives .
That is a moment which is a gi@@ ft of God to us — a gi@@ ft when , for a moment , he li@@ f@@ ts that bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y which makes us in@@ si@@ st on &quot; &quot; I , I , I , me , me , me , &quot; &quot; and instead , like the person in R@@ u@@ m@@ i &apos;s story , we say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is all you .
This is all you . And this is all us .
And us , and I , and us are all part of you .
O , Cre@@ at@@ or ! O , the O@@ b@@ jec@@ tive ! The s@@ our@@ ce of our being and the end of our j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , you are also the bre@@ a@@ ker of our hear@@ ts .
You are the one who@@ m we should all be to@@ war@@ ds , for wh@@ ose pur@@ pos@@ e we live , and for wh@@ ose pur@@ pos@@ e we sh@@ all di@@ e , and for wh@@ ose pur@@ pos@@ e we sh@@ all be res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted again to ac@@ coun@@ t to God to what ex@@ t@@ ent we have been compas@@ sion@@ ate be@@ ings . &quot; &quot; Ou@@ r mes@@ sa@@ ge today , and our pur@@ pos@@ e today , and those of you who are here today , and the pur@@ pos@@ e of this char@@ ter of compassion , is to re@@ mind .
For the K@@ or@@ an always ur@@ ges us to remember , to re@@ mind each other , because the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of tru@@ th is within every human being .
We know it all .
We have ac@@ cess to it all .
J@@ un@@ g may have called it &quot; &quot; the sub@@ consci@@ ous . &quot; &quot; Th@@ rou@@ gh our sub@@ consci@@ ous , in your dre@@ a@@ ms — the K@@ or@@ an cal@@ ls our sta@@ te of s@@ le@@ ep &quot; &quot; the l@@ es@@ ser death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tem@@ por@@ ary death &quot; &quot; — in our sta@@ te of s@@ le@@ ep we have dre@@ a@@ ms , we have visi@@ ons , we tra@@ vel even out@@ side of our bo@@ dies , for many of us , and we see wonderful things .
We tra@@ vel be@@ y@@ on@@ d the limi@@ ta@@ tions of space as we know it , and be@@ y@@ on@@ d the limi@@ ta@@ tions of time as we know it .
But all this is for us to g@@ l@@ ori@@ f@@ y the name of the cre@@ at@@ or wh@@ ose pri@@ mar@@ y name is the compas@@ sion@@ ating , the compas@@ sion@@ ate .
God , Bo@@ k@@ h , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver name you want to call him with , Al@@ la@@ h , R@@ am , O@@ m , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver the name might be through which you name or ac@@ cess the pres@@ ence of di@@ vin@@ ity , it is the lo@@ c@@ us of absolu@@ te being , absolu@@ te love and mer@@ cy and compassion , and absolu@@ te kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and wis@@ dom , what H@@ in@@ d@@ us call &quot; &quot; sa@@ t@@ ch@@ id@@ an@@ an@@ da . &quot; &quot; The language differ@@ s , but the ob@@ jec@@ tive is the same .
R@@ u@@ m@@ i has another story about three men , a Tur@@ k , an A@@ ra@@ b and — and I for@@ get the th@@ ird person , but for my sa@@ ke , it could be a M@@ al@@ ay .
One is as@@ king for an@@ gu@@ r — one is , say , an Engli@@ sh@@ man — one is as@@ king for en@@ e@@ b , and one is as@@ king for gra@@ pes .
And they have a fi@@ ght and an ar@@ gu@@ ment because — &quot; &quot; I want gra@@ pes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want en@@ e@@ b . &quot; &quot; I want an@@ gu@@ r . &quot; &quot; — not kno@@ wing that the word that they &apos;re using re@@ fer@@ s to the same re@@ ality in different langu@@ ages .
There &apos;s only one absolu@@ te re@@ ality by defini@@ tion , one absolu@@ te being by defini@@ tion , because absolu@@ te is , by defini@@ tion , single , and absolu@@ te and sin@@ gu@@ lar .
There &apos;s this absolu@@ te con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion of being , the absolu@@ te con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion of consci@@ ousness , a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , an absolu@@ te lo@@ c@@ us of compassion and love that defin@@ es the pri@@ mar@@ y at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of di@@ vin@@ ity .
And these should also be the pri@@ mar@@ y at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of what it means to be human .
For what defin@@ es human@@ ity , per@@ haps bio@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally , is our physi@@ o@@ logy , but God defin@@ es human@@ ity by our spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality , by our n@@ ature .
And the K@@ or@@ an says , He spe@@ a@@ ks to the an@@ g@@ els and says , &quot; &quot; When I have fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed the forma@@ tion of A@@ da@@ m from cla@@ y , and bre@@ a@@ the@@ d into him of my spi@@ ri@@ t , then , f@@ all in pro@@ stra@@ tion to him . &quot; &quot; The an@@ g@@ els pro@@ stra@@ te , not before the human body , but before the human s@@ ou@@ l .
Why ? Because the s@@ ou@@ l , the human s@@ ou@@ l , em@@ bo@@ dies a piece of the di@@ v@@ ine bre@@ ath , a piece of the di@@ v@@ ine s@@ ou@@ l .
This is also expres@@ sed in bi@@ bli@@ cal vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ary when we are ta@@ u@@ ght that we were cre@@ ated in the di@@ v@@ ine ima@@ ge .
What is the imag@@ er@@ y of God ?
The imag@@ er@@ y of God is absolu@@ te being , absolu@@ te a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and wis@@ dom and absolu@@ te compassion and love .
And ther@@ e@@ fore , for us to be human — in the gre@@ at@@ est sense of what it means to be human , in the most jo@@ y@@ ful sense of what it means to be human — means that we too have to be pro@@ per ste@@ war@@ ds of the bre@@ ath of di@@ vin@@ ity within us , and see@@ k to perfec@@ t within ourselves the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te of being , of being ali@@ ve , of be@@ ing@@ ness ; the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te of wis@@ dom , of consci@@ ousness , of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ; and the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te of being compas@@ sion@@ ate and lo@@ ving be@@ ings .
This is what I understand from my fa@@ ith tradi@@ tion , and this is what I understand from my stu@@ dies of other fa@@ ith tradi@@ tions , and this is the common pla@@ t@@ form on which we must all st@@ and , and when we st@@ and on this pla@@ t@@ form as such , I am con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that we can make a wonderful world .
And I believe , person@@ ally , that we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge and that , with the pres@@ ence and help of people like you here , we can br@@ ing about the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
For he fo@@ re@@ told of a peri@@ od when people sh@@ all trans@@ form their s@@ words into p@@ low@@ sh@@ ares and will not learn w@@ ar or make w@@ ar any@@ more .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a sta@@ ge in human hist@@ ory that we have no op@@ tion : we must , we must lo@@ wer our e@@ gos , control our e@@ gos — whether it is individu@@ al e@@ go , person@@ al e@@ go , family e@@ go , national e@@ go — and let all be for the g@@ l@@ ori@@ fi@@ cation of the one .
Thank you , and God b@@ less you .
( Applause )
There &apos;s still some con@@ fu@@ sion about that question , as this is a fa@@ ir@@ ly new fiel@@ d of research .
For example , I was talking to one of my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , who is an on@@ co@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , and he was telling me , &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ dr@@ ine , this is pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling .
So@@ me of my patients that have been told they are cu@@ red of their cancer still develo@@ p sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms of depres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; And I respon@@ ded to him , &quot; &quot; Well , from my point of vie@@ w that makes sense .
The drug you give to your patients that st@@ op@@ s the cancer cells multi@@ pl@@ ying also st@@ op@@ s the ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n neurons being gener@@ ated in their brain . &quot; &quot; And then R@@ ob@@ er@@ t looked at me like I was cra@@ z@@ y and said , &quot; &quot; But S@@ an@@ dr@@ ine , these are adul@@ t patients — adul@@ ts do not grow new ner@@ ve cells . &quot; &quot; And much to his sur@@ pri@@ se , I said , &quot; &quot; Well actually , we do . &quot; &quot; And this is a ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on that we call neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
&#91; Ne@@ uro@@ gen@@ esis &#93; Now R@@ ob@@ er@@ t is not a neuro@@ scienti@@ st , and when he went to medical school he was not ta@@ u@@ ght what we know now — that the adul@@ t brain can gener@@ ate new ner@@ ve cells .
So R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , you know , being the good doc@@ tor that he is , wanted to come to my lab to understand the to@@ pi@@ c a little bit better .
And I took him for a t@@ our of one of the most exci@@ ting par@@ ts of the brain when it comes to neuro@@ gen@@ esis — and this is the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us .
So this is this gra@@ y struc@@ ture in the cen@@ ter of the brain .
And what we &apos;ve kno@@ wn already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memor@@ y , mo@@ od and emo@@ tion .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , what we have learned more rec@@ ently is that this is one of the uni@@ que struc@@ tures of the adul@@ t brain where new neurons can be gener@@ ated .
And if we sli@@ ce through the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us and z@@ oo@@ m in , what you actually see here in blue is a ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n ne@@ ur@@ on in an adul@@ t m@@ ouse brain .
So when it comes to the human brain — my col@@ lea@@ gue J@@ on@@ as F@@ ris@@ én from the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te@@ t , has esti@@ ma@@ ted that we produ@@ ce 7@@ 00 new neurons per day in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us .
You might think this is not much , compar@@ ed to the bi@@ llions of neurons we have .
But by the time we turn 50 , we will have all ex@@ chan@@ ged the neurons we were bor@@ n with in that struc@@ ture with adul@@ t@@ -@@ bor@@ n neurons .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their func@@ tions ?
F@@ ir@@ st , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and memor@@ y .
And in the lab we have sho@@ wn that if we blo@@ ck the ability of the adul@@ t brain to produ@@ ce new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us , then we blo@@ ck cer@@ tain memor@@ y abili@@ ties .
And this is especi@@ ally new and true for s@@ pati@@ al recogni@@ tion — so like , how you na@@ vi@@ ga@@ te your way in the city .
And they will have been hel@@ p@@ ful to ad@@ d time to our memor@@ y and they will help differ@@ enti@@ ate very similar memor@@ ies , like : how do you find your bi@@ ke that you par@@ k at the sta@@ tion every day in the same are@@ a , but in a sli@@ gh@@ tly different posi@@ tion ?
And more interesting to my col@@ lea@@ gue R@@ ob@@ er@@ t is the research we have been doing on neuro@@ gen@@ esis and depres@@ sion .
So in an animal mode@@ l of depres@@ sion , we have seen that we have a lo@@ wer level of neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
And if we give anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts , then we incre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of these ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n neurons , and we de@@ cre@@ ase the sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms of depres@@ sion , esta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ing a c@@ lear lin@@ k between neuro@@ gen@@ esis and depres@@ sion .
But mo@@ re@@ over , if you just blo@@ ck neuro@@ gen@@ esis , then you blo@@ ck the ef@@ fica@@ cy of the anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant .
So by then , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t had underst@@ o@@ od that very li@@ ke@@ ly his patients were suf@@ fer@@ ing from depres@@ sion even after being cu@@ red of their cancer , because the cancer drug had st@@ op@@ ped ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n neurons from being gener@@ ated .
And it will take time to gener@@ ate new neurons that re@@ ach normal func@@ tions .
So , col@@ lec@@ tively , now we think we have enough evi@@ den@@ ce to say that neuro@@ gen@@ esis is a tar@@ get of cho@@ ice if we want to impro@@ ve memor@@ y forma@@ tion or mo@@ od , or even pre@@ v@@ ent the de@@ c@@ line as@@ soci@@ ated with aging , or as@@ soci@@ ated with st@@ ress .
So the next question is : can we control neuro@@ gen@@ esis ?
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qui@@ z .
I &apos;m going to give you a set of behavi@@ ors and activi@@ ties , and you tell me if you think they will incre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis or if they will de@@ cre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
A@@ re we ready ?
O@@ K , let &apos;s go .
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
Y@@ es .
L@@ ear@@ ning will incre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons .
How about st@@ ress ?
Y@@ es , st@@ ress will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us .
How about s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priva@@ tion ?
In@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
How about se@@ x ?
Oh , w@@ ow !
( Laughter ) Y@@ es , you are right , it will incre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons .
We don &apos;t want to f@@ all in a situ@@ ation — ( Laughter ) about too much se@@ x le@@ ad@@ ing to s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priva@@ tion . ( Laughter )
How about getting ol@@ der ?
So the neuro@@ gen@@ esis rate will de@@ cre@@ ase as we get ol@@ der , but it is still oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing .
And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?
I will let you j@@ ud@@ ge that one by yourself .
So this is one of the first stu@@ dies that was car@@ ri@@ ed out by one of my men@@ tors , R@@ u@@ st@@ y G@@ age from the S@@ al@@ k In@@ stitu@@ te , sho@@ wing that the environment can have an impac@@ t on the produc@@ tion of new neurons .
And here you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us of a m@@ ouse that had no run@@ ning whe@@ el in its ca@@ ge .
And the little black d@@ ots you see are actually ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n neuro@@ n@@ s@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ be .
And now , you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us of a m@@ ouse that had a run@@ ning whe@@ el in its ca@@ ge .
So you see the mas@@ sive incre@@ ase of the black d@@ ots repres@@ ent@@ ing the new neuro@@ n@@ s@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ be .
So activi@@ ty impac@@ ts neuro@@ gen@@ esis , but that &apos;s not all .
What you eat will have an effec@@ t on the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us .
So here we have a sa@@ mp@@ le of di@@ et — of nu@@ tri@@ ents that have been sho@@ wn to have ef@@ fica@@ cy .
And I &apos;m just going to point a few out to you : C@@ al@@ ori@@ e r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ tion of 20 to 30 percent will incre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
Inter@@ mi@@ tt@@ ent fa@@ st@@ ing — sp@@ ac@@ ing the time between your me@@ als — will incre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
In@@ take of f@@ la@@ v@@ on@@ o@@ i@@ ds , which are con@@ tain@@ ed in dar@@ k cho@@ co@@ late or b@@ lu@@ e@@ ber@@ ri@@ es , will incre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
O@@ me@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty a@@ ci@@ ds , present in f@@ at@@ ty fish , like sal@@ mon , will incre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons .
Con@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , a di@@ et ri@@ ch in high sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted f@@ at will have a ne@@ ga@@ tive impac@@ t on neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
E@@ th@@ an@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l — will de@@ cre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , not everything is lost ; res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , which is con@@ tain@@ ed in red w@@ ine , has been sho@@ wn to pro@@ m@@ ote the sur@@ viv@@ al of these new neurons .
So next time you are at a din@@ ner par@@ ty , you might want to re@@ ach for this pos@@ si@@ bly &quot; &quot; neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l &quot; &quot; dr@@ in@@ k .
So J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese g@@ rou@@ ps are fas@@ cin@@ ated with food tex@@ tures , and they have sho@@ wn that actually so@@ ft di@@ et im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s neuro@@ gen@@ esis , as op@@ pos@@ ed to food that re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es ma@@ sti@@ cation — che@@ wing — or cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y food .
So all of this data , where we need to look at the cel@@ lu@@ lar level , has been gener@@ ated using animal mode@@ ls .
But this di@@ et has also been given to human partici@@ pan@@ ts , and what we could see is that the di@@ et mo@@ du@@ la@@ tes memor@@ y and mo@@ od in the same direc@@ tion as it mo@@ du@@ la@@ tes neuro@@ gen@@ esis , such as : cal@@ ori@@ e r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ tion will impro@@ ve memor@@ y capaci@@ ty , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as a high@@ -@@ f@@ at di@@ et will exac@@ er@@ ba@@ te sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms of depres@@ sion — as op@@ pos@@ ed to o@@ me@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty a@@ ci@@ ds , which incre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ esis , and also help to de@@ cre@@ ase the sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms of depres@@ sion .
So we think that the effec@@ t of di@@ et on mental health , on memor@@ y and mo@@ od , is actually medi@@ ated by the produc@@ tion of the new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us .
And it &apos;s not only what you eat , but it &apos;s also the tex@@ ture of the food , when you eat it and how much of it you eat .
O@@ n our side — neuro@@ scienti@@ sts interes@@ ted in neuro@@ gen@@ esis — we need to understand better the func@@ tion of these new neurons , and how we can control their sur@@ viv@@ al and their produc@@ tion .
We also need to find a way to protec@@ t the neuro@@ gen@@ esis of R@@ ob@@ er@@ t &apos;s patients .
And on your side — I lea@@ ve you in char@@ ge of your neuro@@ gen@@ esis .
Thank you .
Now , I told you you chan@@ ged my life — I now eat a lot of b@@ lu@@ e@@ ber@@ ri@@ es .
S@@ an@@ dr@@ ine Th@@ u@@ re@@ t : V@@ er@@ y good .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interes@@ ted in the run@@ ning thing .
D@@ o I have to r@@ un ?
O@@ r is it really just about a@@ er@@ o@@ bi@@ c exer@@ ci@@ se , getting o@@ x@@ y@@ gen to the brain ?
C@@ ould it be any kind of vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous exer@@ ci@@ se ?
S@@ T : So for the moment , we can &apos;t really say if it &apos;s just the run@@ ning it@@ self , but we think that anything that in@@ de@@ ed will incre@@ ase the produc@@ tion — or mo@@ ving the blood f@@ low to the brain , should be ben@@ efici@@ al .
S@@ T : No , you don &apos;t !
M@@ H : Oh , what a reli@@ e@@ f ! That &apos;s wonderful .
S@@ an@@ dr@@ ine Th@@ u@@ re@@ t , th@@ ank you so much .
S@@ T : Thank you , Mar@@ gar@@ et .
I &apos;ve been fas@@ cin@@ ated with cro@@ p diversi@@ ty for about 3@@ 5 years from now , ever sin@@ ce I stu@@ mb@@ led across a fa@@ ir@@ ly ob@@ s@@ cur@@ e aca@@ de@@ mic ar@@ tic@@ le by a guy na@@ med J@@ ack H@@ ar@@ lan .
And he descri@@ bed the diversi@@ ty within cro@@ ps — all the different kinds of whe@@ at and ri@@ ce and such — as a genetic res@@ our@@ ce .
And he said , &quot; &quot; This genetic res@@ our@@ ce , &quot; &quot; — and I &apos;ll never for@@ get the words — &quot; &quot; stan@@ ds between us and ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phi@@ c star@@ va@@ tion on a s@@ cal@@ e we cannot imagine . &quot; &quot; I fi@@ gu@@ red he was ei@@ ther really on to something , or he was one of these aca@@ de@@ mic nu@@ t@@ ca@@ ses .
So , I looked a little f@@ ur@@ ther , and what I fi@@ gu@@ red out was that he was@@ n &apos;t a nu@@ t@@ case .
He was the most res@@ pec@@ ted scienti@@ st in the fiel@@ d .
What he underst@@ o@@ od was that bio@@ logical diversi@@ ty — cro@@ p diversi@@ ty — is the bio@@ logical fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ culture .
It &apos;s the ra@@ w material , the stuff , of evolu@@ tion in our ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural cro@@ ps .
No@@ t a tri@@ vi@@ al matter .
And he also underst@@ o@@ od that that fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion was cru@@ mb@@ ling , liter@@ ally cru@@ mb@@ ling .
That in@@ de@@ ed , a ma@@ ss ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion was under@@ way in our fiel@@ ds , in our ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural system .
And that this ma@@ ss ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion was taking place with very few people no@@ tic@@ ing and even fe@@ wer car@@ ing .
Now , I know that many of you don &apos;t stop to think about diversi@@ ty in ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural syste@@ ms and , let &apos;s face it , that &apos;s logical .
You don &apos;t see it in the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per every day .
And when you go into the super@@ mar@@ ket , you cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t see a lot of cho@@ ic@@ es there .
You see ap@@ pl@@ es that are red , y@@ el@@ low , and green and that &apos;s about it .
So , let me show you a picture of one form of diversi@@ ty .
Here &apos;s some be@@ ans , and there are about 3@@ 5 or 40 different vari@@ e@@ ties of be@@ ans on this picture .
Now , imagine each one of these vari@@ e@@ ties as being dist@@ inc@@ t from another about the same way as a po@@ o@@ dle from a Gre@@ at D@@ an@@ e .
If I wanted to show you a picture of all the do@@ g bre@@ e@@ ds in the world , and I put 30 or 40 of them on a sli@@ de , it would take about 10 sli@@ des because there about 4@@ 00 bre@@ e@@ ds of do@@ gs in the world .
But there are 3@@ 5 to 4@@ 0@@ ,000 different vari@@ e@@ ties of be@@ ans .
So if I were to going to show you all the be@@ ans in the world , and I had a sli@@ de like this , and I s@@ w@@ it@@ ched it every second , it would take up my entire TED talk , and I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t have to say anything .
But the interesting thing is that this diversi@@ ty — and the tra@@ gi@@ c thing is — that this diversi@@ ty is being lost .
We have about 200@@ ,000 different vari@@ e@@ ties of whe@@ at , and we have about 2 to 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 different vari@@ e@@ ties of ri@@ ce , but it &apos;s being lost .
And I want to give you an example of that .
It &apos;s a bit of a person@@ al example , in fact .
In the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , in the 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ s — that &apos;s where we have the best data — far@@ m@@ ers and gar@@ den@@ ers were gro@@ wing 7@@ ,@@ 100 na@@ med vari@@ e@@ ties of ap@@ pl@@ es .
Ima@@ g@@ ine that . 7@@ ,@@ 100 ap@@ pl@@ es with na@@ mes .
To@@ day , 6@@ ,@@ 8@@ 00 of those are ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t , no lon@@ ger to be seen again .
I used to have a li@@ st of these ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t ap@@ pl@@ es , and when I would go out and give a pres@@ en@@ tation , I would pas@@ s the li@@ st out in the audi@@ ence .
I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ tical order , and I would tell them to look for their na@@ mes , their family na@@ mes , their mother &apos;s mai@@ den name .
And at the end of the spe@@ ec@@ h , I would ask , &quot; &quot; How many people have found a name ? &quot; &quot; And I never had fe@@ wer than tw@@ o@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of an audi@@ ence h@@ old up their hand .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? These ap@@ pl@@ es come from your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , and your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors ga@@ ve them the gre@@ at@@ est hon@@ or they could give them .
They ga@@ ve them their name .
The bad news is they &apos;re ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t .
The good news is a th@@ ird of you didn &apos;t h@@ old up your hand . Y@@ our ap@@ ple &apos;s still out there .
F@@ ind it . Ma@@ ke sure it doesn &apos;t jo@@ in the li@@ st . &quot; &quot; So , I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fo@@ w@@ ler ap@@ ple is still out there .
And there &apos;s an old book back here , and I want to read a piece from it .
This book was publi@@ sh@@ ed in 19@@ 0@@ 4 .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Ap@@ pl@@ es of Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k &quot; &quot; and this is the second volu@@ me .
Se@@ e , we used to have a lot of ap@@ pl@@ es .
And the Fo@@ w@@ ler ap@@ ple is descri@@ bed in here — I hope this doesn &apos;t sur@@ pri@@ se you — as , &quot; &quot; a beautiful f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know if we na@@ med the ap@@ ple or if the ap@@ ple na@@ med us , but ...
but , to be hon@@ est , the descri@@ p@@ tion goes on and it says that it &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t ran@@ k high in qu@@ ality , ho@@ we@@ ver . &quot; &quot; And then he has to go even f@@ ur@@ ther .
It so@@ unds like it was wri@@ t@@ ten by an old school teach@@ er of min@@ e .
&quot; &quot; As gro@@ wn in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , the f@@ ru@@ it us@@ u@@ ally fa@@ il@@ s to develo@@ p pro@@ per@@ ly in size and qu@@ ality and is , on the whole , un@@ sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I gu@@ ess there &apos;s a l@@ es@@ son to be learned here , and the l@@ es@@ son is : so why sa@@ ve it ?
I get this question all the time . Why don &apos;t we just sa@@ ve the best one ?
And there are a cou@@ ple of ans@@ w@@ ers to that question .
One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one .
To@@ day &apos;s best vari@@ e@@ ty is to@@ mor@@ row &apos;s l@@ un@@ ch for in@@ sec@@ ts or p@@ est@@ s or disease .
The other thing is that maybe that Fo@@ w@@ ler ap@@ ple or maybe a vari@@ e@@ ty of whe@@ at that &apos;s not econo@@ mi@@ cal right now has disease or p@@ est resist@@ ance or some qu@@ ality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
So it &apos;s not neces@@ s@@ ary , th@@ ank God , that the Fo@@ w@@ ler ap@@ ple is the best ap@@ ple in the world .
It &apos;s just neces@@ s@@ ary or interesting that it might have one good , uni@@ que tra@@ it .
And for that reason , we ou@@ ght to be sa@@ ving it .
Why ? As a ra@@ w material , as a tra@@ it we can use in the future .
Th@@ in@@ k of diversi@@ ty as gi@@ ving us op@@ tions .
And op@@ tions , of course , are exactly what we need in an era of climate change .
I want to show you two sli@@ des , but first , I want to tell you that we &apos;ve been working at the G@@ lo@@ b@@ al C@@ ro@@ p D@@ i@@ versi@@ ty T@@ r@@ ust with a number of scienti@@ sts — partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d and Uni@@ versi@@ ty of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton — to ask the question : What &apos;s going to happen to ag@@ ri@@ culture in an era of climate change and what kind of tra@@ its and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics do we need in our ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural cro@@ ps to be able to ada@@ pt to this ?
In sh@@ or@@ t , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ des@@ t gro@@ wing se@@ as@@ ons are going to be h@@ ot@@ ter than anything those cro@@ ps have seen in the pa@@ st .
The col@@ des@@ t gro@@ wing se@@ as@@ ons of the future , h@@ ot@@ ter than the h@@ ot@@ test of the pa@@ st .
I@@ s ag@@ ri@@ culture ada@@ p@@ ted to that ?
I don &apos;t know . C@@ an fish play the pi@@ ano ?
If ag@@ ri@@ culture ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t experi@@ en@@ ced that , how could it be ada@@ p@@ ted ?
Now , the high@@ est con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion of po@@ or and hun@@ gr@@ y people in the world , and the place where climate change , i@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally , is going to be the wor@@ st is in S@@ outh A@@ si@@ a and sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
So I &apos;ve pic@@ ked two examp@@ les here , and I want to show you .
In the hist@@ ogra@@ m before you now , the blue bar@@ s repres@@ ent the histori@@ cal ran@@ ge of tem@@ per@@ atur@@ es , going back about far as we have tem@@ per@@ ature data .
And you can see that there &apos;s some differ@@ ence between one gro@@ wing se@@ as@@ on and another .
So@@ me are col@@ der , some are h@@ ot@@ ter and it &apos;s a be@@ ll s@@ ha@@ ped cur@@ ve .
The tal@@ l@@ est b@@ ar is the a@@ ver@@ age tem@@ per@@ ature for the most number of gro@@ wing se@@ as@@ ons .
In the future , later this cent@@ ur@@ y , it &apos;s going to look like the red , tot@@ ally out of bo@@ unds .
The ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural system and , more import@@ an@@ tly , the cro@@ ps in the fiel@@ d in In@@ dia have never experi@@ en@@ ced this before .
Here &apos;s S@@ outh Africa . The same story .
But the most interesting thing about S@@ outh Africa is we don &apos;t have to wa@@ it for 20@@ 70 for there to be t@@ rou@@ ble .
B@@ y 20@@ 30 , if the mai@@ ze , or cor@@ n , vari@@ e@@ ties , which is the do@@ min@@ ant cro@@ p — 50 percent of the nu@@ tri@@ tion in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Africa are still in the fiel@@ d — in 20@@ 30 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in produc@@ tion of mai@@ ze because of the climate change already in 20@@ 30 .
30 percent de@@ cre@@ ase of produc@@ tion in the con@@ text of incre@@ as@@ ing population , that &apos;s a food cri@@ sis . It &apos;s global in n@@ ature .
We will wat@@ ch children star@@ ve to death on T@@ V .
Now , you may say that 20 years is a long way off .
It &apos;s two bre@@ e@@ ding cy@@ c@@ les for mai@@ ze .
We have two ro@@ lls of the di@@ ce to get this right .
We have to get cli@@ mate@@ -@@ ready cro@@ ps in the fiel@@ d , and we have to do that ra@@ ther qu@@ ick@@ ly .
Now , the good news is that we have con@@ ser@@ ved .
We have col@@ lec@@ ted and con@@ ser@@ ved a great de@@ al of bio@@ logical diversi@@ ty , ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural diversi@@ ty , most@@ ly in the form of se@@ ed , and we put it in se@@ ed ban@@ ks , which is a fan@@ cy way of saying a f@@ ree@@ z@@ er .
If you want to con@@ ser@@ ve se@@ ed for a long ter@@ m and you want to make it a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to pl@@ ant bre@@ e@@ ders and resear@@ ch@@ ers , you dr@@ y it and then you f@@ ree@@ ze it .
Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , these se@@ ed ban@@ ks are lo@@ ca@@ ted around the world in buil@@ d@@ ings and they &apos;re vulner@@ able .
D@@ i@@ sa@@ st@@ ers have happened . In rec@@ ent years we lost the gene b@@ ank , the se@@ ed b@@ ank in I@@ ra@@ q and Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan . You can gu@@ ess why .
In R@@ wan@@ da , in the So@@ lo@@ mon Is@@ lan@@ ds .
And then there are just da@@ i@@ ly disa@@ st@@ ers that take place in these buil@@ d@@ ings , finan@@ cial problems and mis@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment and equi@@ p@@ ment fa@@ il@@ ur@@ es , and all kinds of things , and every time something like this happens , it means ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion . We lo@@ se diversi@@ ty .
And I &apos;m not talking about lo@@ sing diversi@@ ty in the same way that you lo@@ se your car ke@@ ys .
I &apos;m talking about lo@@ sing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaur@@ s : actually lo@@ sing it , never to be seen again .
So , a number of us got together and decided that , you know , enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a faci@@ li@@ ty that can really of@@ fer protec@@ tion for our bio@@ logical diversi@@ ty of — maybe not the most char@@ is@@ ma@@ tic diversi@@ ty .
You don &apos;t look in the eyes of a car@@ ro@@ t se@@ ed quite in the way you do a pan@@ da be@@ ar , but it &apos;s very important diversi@@ ty .
So we nee@@ ded a really sa@@ fe place , and we went quite far nor@@ th to find it .
To S@@ val@@ b@@ ard , in fact .
This is ab@@ o@@ ve ma@@ in@@ land Nor@@ way . You can see Gre@@ en@@ land there .
That &apos;s at 7@@ 8 de@@ gre@@ es nor@@ th .
It &apos;s as far as you can f@@ ly on a re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly s@@ che@@ du@@ led a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e .
It &apos;s a re@@ mar@@ k@@ ab@@ ly beautiful lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe . I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to descri@@ be it to you .
It &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wor@@ l@@ d@@ ly , beautiful .
We worked with the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an government and with the Nor@@ G@@ en , the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an G@@ en@@ e@@ tic R@@ es@@ our@@ ces Pro@@ gra@@ m , to desig@@ n this faci@@ li@@ ty .
What you see is an arti@@ st &apos;s concep@@ tion of this faci@@ li@@ ty , which is buil@@ t in a moun@@ tain in S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
The idea of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard was that it &apos;s co@@ ld , so we get natural f@@ ree@@ zing tem@@ per@@ atur@@ es .
But it &apos;s re@@ m@@ ote . It &apos;s re@@ m@@ ote and ac@@ ces@@ sible so it &apos;s sa@@ fe and we don &apos;t depen@@ d on me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
This is more than just an arti@@ st &apos;s dre@@ am , it &apos;s now a re@@ ality .
And this next picture sho@@ ws it in con@@ text , in S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
And here &apos;s the front do@@ or of this faci@@ li@@ ty .
When you open up the front do@@ or , this is what you &apos;re looking at . It &apos;s pretty simple . It &apos;s a ho@@ le in the ground .
It &apos;s a tun@@ ne@@ l , and you go into the tun@@ ne@@ l , chi@@ se@@ led in so@@ li@@ d ro@@ ck , about 1@@ 30 me@@ ters .
There are now a cou@@ ple of se@@ curi@@ ty do@@ ors , so you w@@ on &apos;t see it quite like this .
A@@ ga@@ in , when you get to the back , you get into an are@@ a that &apos;s really my fav@@ ori@@ te place .
I think of it as sort of a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
And I know that this ta@@ gs me as a bit of a ner@@ d , but ...
( Laughter ) So@@ me of the hap@@ pi@@ est days of my life have been sp@@ ent ... ( Laughter )
in this place there .
( Applause ) If you were to wal@@ k into one of these roo@@ ms , you would see this .
It &apos;s not very exci@@ ting , but if you know what &apos;s there , it &apos;s pretty emo@@ tional .
We have now about 4@@ 2@@ 5@@ ,000 sa@@ mp@@ les of uni@@ que cro@@ p vari@@ e@@ ties .
There &apos;s 7@@ 0@@ ,000 sa@@ mp@@ les of different vari@@ e@@ ties of ri@@ ce in this faci@@ li@@ ty right now .
A@@ b@@ out a year from now , we &apos;ll have over half a million sa@@ mp@@ les .
We &apos;re going up to over a million , and some@@ day we &apos;ll basi@@ cally have sa@@ mp@@ les — about 5@@ 00 see@@ ds — of every vari@@ e@@ ty of ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural cro@@ p that can be sto@@ red in a fro@@ z@@ en sta@@ te in this faci@@ li@@ ty .
This is a bac@@ k@@ up system for world ag@@ ri@@ culture .
It &apos;s a bac@@ k@@ up system for all the se@@ ed ban@@ ks . S@@ tor@@ age is f@@ ree .
It oper@@ ates like a sa@@ fe@@ ty de@@ pos@@ it bo@@ x .
Nor@@ way o@@ w@@ ns the moun@@ tain and the faci@@ li@@ ty , but the de@@ pos@@ it@@ ors own the se@@ ed .
And if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
This particular picture that you see sho@@ ws the national col@@ lec@@ tion of the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , of Can@@ ada , and an inter@@ national institu@@ tion from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a .
I think it &apos;s interesting in that this faci@@ li@@ ty , I think , is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries , liter@@ ally , every country in the world — because we have see@@ ds from every country in the world — all the countries of the world have g@@ ot@@ ten together to do something that &apos;s both long ter@@ m , s@@ us@@ tain@@ able and posi@@ tive .
I can &apos;t think of anything else that &apos;s happened in my li@@ fe@@ time that way .
I can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solu@@ tion for climate change , for the water cri@@ sis .
Ag@@ ri@@ culture takes 70 percent of f@@ res@@ h water sup@@ pli@@ es on ear@@ th .
I can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solu@@ tion for those things , or the energy cri@@ sis , or world hun@@ ger , or pe@@ ace in con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
I can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solu@@ tion for that , but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can &apos;t sol@@ ve any of those problems if we don &apos;t have cro@@ p diversi@@ ty .
Because I ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge you to think of an effec@@ tive , ef@@ fici@@ ent , s@@ us@@ tain@@ able solu@@ tion to climate change if we don &apos;t have cro@@ p diversi@@ ty .
Because , quite liter@@ ally , if ag@@ ri@@ culture doesn &apos;t ada@@ pt to climate change , ne@@ i@@ ther will we .
And if cro@@ ps don &apos;t ada@@ pt to climate change , ne@@ i@@ ther will ag@@ ri@@ culture , ne@@ i@@ ther will we .
So , this is not something pretty and n@@ ice to do .
There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversi@@ ty exis@@ t just for the exist@@ ence valu@@ e of it .
It is , I ag@@ ree , a n@@ ice thing to do .
But it &apos;s a neces@@ s@@ ary thing to do .
So , in a very real sense , I believe that we , as an inter@@ national commun@@ ity , should get organi@@ zed to comple@@ te the tas@@ k .
The S@@ val@@ b@@ ard G@@ lo@@ b@@ al Se@@ ed V@@ a@@ ul@@ t is a wonderful gi@@ ft that Nor@@ way and others have given us , but it &apos;s not the comple@@ te answer .
We need to col@@ lec@@ t the rema@@ in@@ ing diversi@@ ty that &apos;s out there .
We need to put it into good se@@ ed ban@@ ks that can of@@ fer those see@@ ds to resear@@ ch@@ ers in the future .
We need to ca@@ tal@@ o@@ g it . It &apos;s a li@@ br@@ ary of life , but right now I would say we don &apos;t have a car@@ d ca@@ tal@@ o@@ g for it .
And we need to sup@@ port it finan@@ ci@@ ally .
My big idea would be that while we think of it as com@@ mon@@ place to en@@ do@@ w an art mu@@ se@@ um or en@@ do@@ w a cha@@ ir at a uni@@ versi@@ ty , we really ou@@ ght to be thinking about en@@ do@@ wing whe@@ at .
30 million dollars in an en@@ do@@ w@@ ment would take care of pres@@ er@@ ving all the diversi@@ ty in whe@@ at fo@@ re@@ ver .
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those ter@@ ms .
And my final thought is that we , of course , by con@@ ser@@ ving whe@@ at , ri@@ ce , po@@ ta@@ to@@ es , and the other cro@@ ps , we may , quite simply , end up sa@@ ving ourselves .
Thank you .

So I wanted to tell a story that really ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed me when I was wri@@ ting my new book , and it &apos;s a story of something that happened 3@@ ,000 years ago , when the K@@ ing@@ dom of Isra@@ el was in its inf@@ an@@ cy .
And it takes place in an are@@ a called the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h in what is now Isra@@ el .
And the reason the story ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed me is that I thought I underst@@ o@@ od it , and then I went back over it and I realiz@@ ed that I didn &apos;t understand it at all .
An@@ ci@@ ent P@@ al@@ est@@ ine had a — al@@ ong its e@@ a@@ ster@@ n bor@@ der , there &apos;s a moun@@ tain ran@@ ge .
S@@ ti@@ ll same is true of Isra@@ el today .
And in the moun@@ tain ran@@ ge are all of the an@@ ci@@ ent ci@@ ties of that re@@ gi@@ on , so J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m , Be@@ th@@ le@@ he@@ m , H@@ e@@ br@@ on .
And then there &apos;s a co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in al@@ ong the M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , where T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v is now .
And connec@@ ting the moun@@ tain ran@@ ge with the co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in is an are@@ a called the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h , which is a seri@@ es of val@@ le@@ ys and ri@@ d@@ ges that r@@ un e@@ ast to w@@ est , and you can fol@@ low the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h , go through the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h to get from the co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in to the moun@@ ta@@ ins .
And the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h , if you &apos;ve been to Isra@@ el , you &apos;ll know it &apos;s just about the most beautiful part of Isra@@ el .
It &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , with for@@ est@@ s of o@@ ak and whe@@ at fiel@@ ds and vin@@ ey@@ ar@@ ds .
But more import@@ an@@ tly , though , in the hist@@ ory of that re@@ gi@@ on , it &apos;s ser@@ ved , it &apos;s had a real stra@@ te@@ gi@@ c func@@ tion , and that is , it is the means by which ho@@ sti@@ le ar@@ mi@@ es on the co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in find their way , get up into the moun@@ ta@@ ins and th@@ re@@ a@@ ten those living in the moun@@ ta@@ ins .
And 3@@ ,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
The P@@ hi@@ list@@ in@@ es , who are the bi@@ gg@@ est of en@@ e@@ mi@@ es of the K@@ ing@@ dom of Isra@@ el , are living in the co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in .
They &apos;re ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally from Cre@@ te . They &apos;re a se@@ af@@ ar@@ ing people .
And they may start to make their way through one of the val@@ le@@ ys of the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h up into the moun@@ ta@@ ins , because what they want to do is oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y the high@@ land are@@ a right by Be@@ th@@ le@@ he@@ m and sp@@ li@@ t the K@@ ing@@ dom of Isra@@ el in two .
And the K@@ ing@@ dom of Isra@@ el , which is he@@ a@@ ded by K@@ ing S@@ au@@ l , obvi@@ ously ca@@ t@@ ches w@@ ind of this , and S@@ au@@ l br@@ ings his ar@@ my down from the moun@@ ta@@ ins and he con@@ fron@@ ts the P@@ hi@@ list@@ in@@ es in the V@@ al@@ le@@ y of E@@ la@@ h , one of the most beautiful of the val@@ le@@ ys of the S@@ he@@ p@@ he@@ la@@ h .
And the Isra@@ eli@@ tes di@@ g in al@@ ong the nor@@ ther@@ n ri@@ dge , and the P@@ hi@@ list@@ in@@ es di@@ g in al@@ ong the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n ri@@ dge , and the two ar@@ mi@@ es just si@@ t there for wee@@ ks and st@@ are at each other , because they &apos;re de@@ ad@@ lo@@ c@@ ked .
Ne@@ i@@ ther can at@@ ta@@ ck the other , because to at@@ ta@@ ck the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the moun@@ tain into the val@@ le@@ y and then up the other side , and you &apos;re comple@@ tely ex@@ pos@@ ed .
So finally , to bre@@ ak the de@@ ad@@ lo@@ ck , the P@@ hi@@ list@@ in@@ es sen@@ d their mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est war@@ ri@@ or down into the val@@ le@@ y flo@@ or , and he cal@@ ls out and he says to the Isra@@ eli@@ tes , &quot; &quot; S@@ end your mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est war@@ ri@@ or down , and we &apos;ll have this out , just the two of us . &quot; &quot; This was a tradi@@ tion in an@@ ci@@ ent war@@ f@@ are called single com@@ b@@ at .
It was a way of se@@ tt@@ ling dis@@ pu@@ tes without in@@ cur@@ r@@ ing the bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed of a ma@@ j@@ or bat@@ t@@ le .
And the P@@ hi@@ list@@ ine who is s@@ ent down , their mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or , is a gi@@ ant .
He &apos;s 6 fo@@ o@@ t 9 .
He &apos;s out@@ f@@ it@@ ted head to to@@ e in this gli@@ tter@@ ing b@@ ron@@ ze ar@@ mor , and he &apos;s got a s@@ word and he &apos;s got a j@@ a@@ ve@@ li@@ n and he &apos;s got his spe@@ ar . He is absolu@@ tely terri@@ f@@ ying .
And he &apos;s so terri@@ f@@ ying that n@@ one of the Isra@@ eli@@ te sol@@ di@@ ers want to fi@@ ght him .
It &apos;s a death wis@@ h , right ? There &apos;s no way they think they can take him .
And finally the only person who will come for@@ ward is this young s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y , and he goes up to S@@ au@@ l and he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll fi@@ ght him . &quot; &quot; And S@@ au@@ l says , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t fi@@ ght him . That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
You &apos;re this kid . This is this mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or . &quot; &quot; But the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d is ada@@ man@@ t . He says , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you don &apos;t understand , I have been defen@@ ding my flo@@ ck aga@@ in@@ st li@@ ons and w@@ ol@@ ves for years . I think I can do it . &quot; &quot; And S@@ au@@ l has no cho@@ ice . He &apos;s got no one else who &apos;s come for@@ ward .
So he says , &quot; &quot; All right . &quot; &quot; And then he tur@@ ns to the kid , and he says , &quot; But you &apos;ve got to we@@ ar this ar@@ mor . You can &apos;t go as you are . &quot;
So he tries to give the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d his ar@@ mor , and the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d says , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t we@@ ar this stuff . &quot; &quot; The B@@ i@@ bli@@ cal ver@@ se is , &quot; &quot; I cannot we@@ ar this for I have not pro@@ ved it , &quot; &quot; me@@ an@@ ing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never wor@@ n ar@@ mor before . You &apos;ve got to be cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; &quot; So he re@@ ach@@ es down instead on the ground and pic@@ ks up five st@@ ones and pu@@ ts them in his s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d &apos;s ba@@ g and star@@ ts to wal@@ k down the moun@@ tain@@ side to me@@ et the gi@@ ant .
And the gi@@ ant se@@ es this figur@@ e appro@@ ach@@ ing , and cal@@ ls out , &quot; &quot; Co@@ me to me so I can fe@@ ed your fl@@ es@@ h to the bir@@ ds of the he@@ a@@ ven@@ s and the be@@ a@@ sts of the fiel@@ d . &quot; &quot; He is@@ su@@ es this kind of ta@@ unt to@@ war@@ ds this person coming to fi@@ ght him .
And the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d dra@@ ws clo@@ ser and clo@@ ser , and the gi@@ ant se@@ es that he &apos;s car@@ r@@ ying a sta@@ ff .
That &apos;s all he &apos;s car@@ r@@ ying .
In@@ stead of a we@@ a@@ po@@ n , just this s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d &apos;s sta@@ ff , and he says — he &apos;s in@@ sul@@ ted — &quot; A@@ m I a do@@ g that you would come to me with stic@@ ks ? &quot;
And the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y takes one of his st@@ ones out of his po@@ c@@ ket , pu@@ ts it in his s@@ ling and ro@@ lls it around and le@@ ts it f@@ ly and it h@@ its the gi@@ ant right between the eyes — right here , in his most vulner@@ able s@@ po@@ t — and he fal@@ ls down ei@@ ther de@@ ad or un@@ consci@@ ous , and the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y r@@ uns up and takes his s@@ word and cu@@ ts off his head , and the P@@ hi@@ list@@ in@@ es see this and they turn and they just r@@ un .
And of course , the name of the gi@@ ant is Goli@@ ath and the name of the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y is David , and the reason that story has ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed me over the course of wri@@ ting my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story tur@@ ned out to be wrong .
So David , in that story , is sup@@ pos@@ ed to be the under@@ do@@ g , right ?
In fact , that ter@@ m , David and Goli@@ ath , has en@@ ter@@ ed our language as a meta@@ ph@@ or for im@@ prob@@ able vi@@ c@@ tori@@ es by some we@@ ak par@@ ty over someone far st@@ ron@@ ger .
Now why do we call David an under@@ do@@ g ?
Well , we call him an under@@ do@@ g because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and Goli@@ ath is this big , st@@ rong gi@@ ant .
We also call him an under@@ do@@ g because Goli@@ ath is an experi@@ en@@ ced war@@ ri@@ or , and David is just a s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
But most import@@ an@@ tly , we call him an under@@ do@@ g because all he has is — it &apos;s that Goli@@ ath is out@@ f@@ it@@ ted with all of this moder@@ n we@@ a@@ pon@@ ry , this gli@@ tter@@ ing co@@ at of ar@@ mor and a s@@ word and a j@@ a@@ ve@@ li@@ n and a spe@@ ar , and all David has is this s@@ ling .
Well , let &apos;s start there with the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; All David has is this s@@ ling , &quot; because that &apos;s the first mi@@ sta@@ ke that we make .
In an@@ ci@@ ent war@@ f@@ are , there are three kinds of war@@ ri@@ ors .
There &apos;s ca@@ val@@ ry , men on hor@@ se@@ back and with ch@@ ari@@ ots .
There &apos;s he@@ av@@ y inf@@ an@@ try , which are fo@@ o@@ t sol@@ di@@ ers , ar@@ med fo@@ o@@ t sol@@ di@@ ers with s@@ words and shi@@ el@@ ds and some kind of ar@@ mor .
And there &apos;s arti@@ ll@@ er@@ y , and arti@@ ll@@ er@@ y are ar@@ ch@@ ers , but , more import@@ an@@ tly , s@@ l@@ ing@@ ers .
And a s@@ l@@ ing@@ er is someone who has a lea@@ ther po@@ uch with two long cor@@ ds at@@ ta@@ ched to it , and they put a pro@@ jec@@ ti@@ le , ei@@ ther a ro@@ ck or a le@@ ad b@@ all , inside the po@@ uch , and they wh@@ ir@@ l it around like this and they let one of the cor@@ ds go , and the effec@@ t is to sen@@ d the pro@@ jec@@ ti@@ le for@@ ward to@@ war@@ ds its tar@@ get .
That &apos;s what David has , and it &apos;s important to understand that that s@@ ling is not a s@@ l@@ ing@@ sho@@ t .
It &apos;s not this , right ? It &apos;s not a child &apos;s to@@ y .
It &apos;s in fact an incre@@ di@@ bly de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting we@@ a@@ po@@ n .
When David ro@@ lls it around like this , he &apos;s tur@@ ning the s@@ ling around probably at six or se@@ ven re@@ volu@@ tions per second , and that means that when the ro@@ ck is re@@ lea@@ sed , it &apos;s going for@@ ward really f@@ ast , probably 3@@ 5 me@@ ters per second .
That &apos;s sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally fas@@ ter than a base@@ b@@ all th@@ ro@@ wn by even the fin@@ est of base@@ b@@ all p@@ it@@ ch@@ ers .
M@@ ore than that , the st@@ ones in the V@@ al@@ le@@ y of E@@ la@@ h were not normal ro@@ c@@ ks . They were b@@ ari@@ um sul@@ p@@ ha@@ te , which are ro@@ c@@ ks tw@@ ice the den@@ si@@ ty of normal st@@ ones .
If you do the cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions on the bal@@ li@@ stics , on the st@@ op@@ ping power of the ro@@ ck fi@@ red from David &apos;s s@@ ling , it &apos;s rou@@ gh@@ ly equ@@ al to the st@@ op@@ ping power of a &#91; .@@ 4@@ 5 c@@ ali@@ b@@ er &#93; han@@ d@@ g@@ un .
This is an incre@@ di@@ bly de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting we@@ a@@ po@@ n .
A@@ c@@ cu@@ rac@@ y , we know from histori@@ cal recor@@ ds that s@@ l@@ ing@@ ers — experi@@ en@@ ced s@@ l@@ ing@@ ers could h@@ it and mai@@ m or even k@@ ill a tar@@ get at dist@@ an@@ ces of up to 200 y@@ ar@@ ds .
F@@ ro@@ m medi@@ ev@@ al ta@@ p@@ est@@ ri@@ es , we know that s@@ l@@ ing@@ ers were cap@@ able of h@@ it@@ ting bir@@ ds in f@@ light .
They were incre@@ di@@ bly ac@@ cu@@ rate .
When David lin@@ es up — and he &apos;s not 200 y@@ ar@@ ds away from Goli@@ ath , he &apos;s quite clo@@ se to Goli@@ ath — when he lin@@ es up and fir@@ es that thing at Goli@@ ath , he has every inten@@ tion and every expec@@ tation of being able to h@@ it Goli@@ ath at his most vulner@@ able s@@ po@@ t between his eyes .
If you go back over the hist@@ ory of an@@ ci@@ ent war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that s@@ l@@ ing@@ ers were the deci@@ sive fac@@ tor aga@@ in@@ st inf@@ an@@ try in one kind of bat@@ t@@ le or another .
So what &apos;s Goli@@ ath ? He &apos;s he@@ av@@ y inf@@ an@@ try , and his expec@@ tation when he ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es the Isra@@ eli@@ tes to a du@@ el is that he &apos;s going to be fi@@ gh@@ ting another he@@ av@@ y inf@@ an@@ tr@@ y@@ man .
When he says , &quot; &quot; Co@@ me to me that I might fe@@ ed your fl@@ es@@ h to the bir@@ ds of the he@@ a@@ ven@@ s and the be@@ a@@ sts of the fiel@@ d , &quot; &quot; the k@@ ey ph@@ ra@@ se is &quot; &quot; Co@@ me to me . &quot; &quot; Co@@ me up to me because we &apos;re going to fi@@ ght , hand to hand , like this .
S@@ au@@ l has the same expec@@ tation .
David says , &quot; &quot; I want to fi@@ ght Goli@@ ath , &quot; &quot; and S@@ au@@ l tries to give him his ar@@ mor , because S@@ au@@ l is thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , when you say &apos; fi@@ ght Goli@@ ath , &apos; you mean &apos; fi@@ ght him in han@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ hand com@@ b@@ at , &apos; inf@@ an@@ try on inf@@ an@@ try . &quot; &quot; But David has absolu@@ tely no expec@@ tation .
He &apos;s not going to fi@@ ght him that way . Why would he ?
He &apos;s a s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d . He &apos;s sp@@ ent his entire car@@ e@@ er using a s@@ ling to de@@ f@@ end his flo@@ ck aga@@ in@@ st li@@ ons and w@@ ol@@ ves .
That &apos;s where his str@@ eng@@ th li@@ es .
So here he is , this s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d , experi@@ en@@ ced in the use of a de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting we@@ a@@ po@@ n , up aga@@ in@@ st this lu@@ m@@ ber@@ ing gi@@ ant we@@ i@@ gh@@ ed down by a hundre@@ d po@@ unds of ar@@ mor and these incre@@ di@@ bly he@@ av@@ y we@@ a@@ po@@ ns that are u@@ se@@ ful only in sh@@ or@@ t@@ -@@ ran@@ ge com@@ b@@ at .
Goli@@ ath is a si@@ tting duc@@ k . He doesn &apos;t have a chan@@ ce .
So why do we keep cal@@ ling David an under@@ do@@ g , and why do we keep re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to his vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory as im@@ prob@@ able ?
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s not just that we mis@@ understand David and his cho@@ ice of we@@ a@@ pon@@ ry .
It &apos;s also that we pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly mis@@ understand Goli@@ ath .
Goli@@ ath is not what he see@@ ms to be .
There &apos;s all kinds of h@@ in@@ ts of this in the B@@ i@@ bli@@ cal text , things that are in re@@ tro@@ spec@@ t quite pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling and don &apos;t s@@ qu@@ are with his ima@@ ge as this mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or .
So to beg@@ in with , the B@@ i@@ ble says that Goli@@ ath is led on@@ to the val@@ le@@ y flo@@ or by an atten@@ d@@ ant .
Now that is we@@ ird , right ?
Here is this mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ing the Isra@@ eli@@ tes to on@@ e@@ -@@ on-@@ one com@@ b@@ at .
Why is he being led by the hand by some young bo@@ y , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , to the point of com@@ b@@ at ?
Se@@ con@@ d@@ ly , the B@@ i@@ ble story makes spe@@ cial n@@ ote of how s@@ low@@ ly Goli@@ ath mo@@ ves , another o@@ d@@ d thing to say when you &apos;re descri@@ b@@ ing the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est war@@ ri@@ or kno@@ wn to man at that point .
And then there &apos;s this whole we@@ ird thing about how long it takes Goli@@ ath to reac@@ t to the si@@ ght of David .
So David &apos;s coming down the moun@@ tain , and he &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not pre@@ par@@ ing for han@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ hand com@@ b@@ at .
There is nothing about him that says , &quot; I am about to fi@@ ght you like this . &quot;
He &apos;s not even car@@ r@@ ying a s@@ word .
Why does Goli@@ ath not reac@@ t to that ?
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to what &apos;s going on that day .
And then there &apos;s that st@@ ran@@ ge com@@ ment he makes to David : &quot; A@@ m I a do@@ g that you should come to me with stic@@ ks ? &quot;
S@@ tic@@ ks ? David only has one stic@@ k .
Well , it tur@@ ns out that there &apos;s been a great de@@ al of spe@@ cu@@ lation within the medical commun@@ ity over the years about whether there is something funda@@ ment@@ ally wrong with Goli@@ ath , an at@@ temp@@ t to make sense of all of those ap@@ par@@ ent an@@ o@@ m@@ ali@@ es .
There have been many ar@@ tic@@ les wri@@ t@@ ten .
The first one was in 19@@ 60 in the In@@ di@@ ana M@@ edi@@ cal J@@ our@@ n@@ al , and it started a cha@@ in of spe@@ cu@@ lation that star@@ ts with an ex@@ plan@@ ation for Goli@@ ath &apos;s he@@ ight .
So Goli@@ ath is head and sh@@ oul@@ ders ab@@ o@@ ve all of his pe@@ ers in that era , and us@@ u@@ ally when someone is that far out of the nor@@ m , there &apos;s an ex@@ plan@@ ation for it .
So the most common form of gi@@ anti@@ s@@ m is a condi@@ tion called acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y , and acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y is ca@@ used by a ben@@ ig@@ n tu@@ mor on your p@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ ary g@@ land that caus@@ es an over@@ produc@@ tion of human gro@@ w@@ th hor@@ m@@ one .
And throu@@ gh@@ out hist@@ ory , many of the most fa@@ mous gi@@ an@@ ts have all had acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
So the tal@@ l@@ est person of all time was a guy na@@ med R@@ ob@@ er@@ t W@@ ad@@ low who was still gro@@ wing when he died at the age of 2@@ 4 and he was 8 fo@@ o@@ t 1@@ 1 .
He had acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
D@@ o you remember the w@@ r@@ est@@ ler An@@ dr@@ é the Gi@@ ant ?
F@@ am@@ ous . He had acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
There &apos;s even spe@@ cu@@ lation that A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m L@@ in@@ col@@ n had acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s un@@ us@@ u@@ ally t@@ all , that &apos;s the first ex@@ plan@@ ation we come up with .
And acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y has a very dist@@ inc@@ t set of side effec@@ ts as@@ soci@@ ated with it , princi@@ p@@ ally having to do with vi@@ sion .
The p@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ ary tu@@ mor , as it gro@@ ws , of@@ ten star@@ ts to com@@ pres@@ s the visual ner@@ ves in your brain , with the resul@@ t that people with acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y have ei@@ ther dou@@ ble vi@@ sion or they are pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly ne@@ ar@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
So when people have started to spe@@ cu@@ late about what might have been wrong with Goli@@ ath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a minu@@ te , he loo@@ ks and so@@ unds an aw@@ ful lot like someone who has acro@@ me@@ gal@@ y . &quot; &quot; And that would also ex@@ pla@@ in so much of what was st@@ ran@@ ge about his behavi@@ or that day .
Why does he move so s@@ low@@ ly and have to be es@@ cor@@ ted down into the val@@ le@@ y flo@@ or by an atten@@ d@@ ant ?
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Why is he so st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to David that he doesn &apos;t understand that David &apos;s not going to fi@@ ght him until the very last moment ?
Because he can &apos;t see him .
When he says , &quot; &quot; Co@@ me to me that I might fe@@ ed your fl@@ es@@ h to the bir@@ ds of the he@@ a@@ ven@@ s and the be@@ a@@ sts of the fiel@@ d , &quot; &quot; the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; come to me &quot; &quot; is a h@@ int also of his vulner@@ ability .
Co@@ me to me because I can &apos;t see you .
And then there &apos;s , &quot; &quot; A@@ m I a do@@ g that you should come to me with stic@@ ks ? &quot; &quot; He se@@ es two stic@@ ks when David has only one .
So the Isra@@ eli@@ tes up on the moun@@ tain ri@@ dge looking down on him thought he was this extraordin@@ ari@@ ly power@@ ful fo@@ e .
What they didn &apos;t understand was that the very thing that was the s@@ our@@ ce of his ap@@ par@@ ent str@@ eng@@ th was also the s@@ our@@ ce of his gre@@ at@@ est we@@ a@@ k@@ ness .
And there is , I think , in that , a very important l@@ es@@ son for all of us .
Gi@@ an@@ ts are not as st@@ rong and power@@ ful as they see@@ m .
And sometimes the s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d bo@@ y has a s@@ ling in his po@@ c@@ ket .
Thank you .

F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago , when I beg@@ an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the ocean , no one — not J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es Per@@ r@@ in , not J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u or R@@ ac@@ he@@ l Car@@ son — imag@@ in@@ ed that we could do anything to har@@ m the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
It see@@ med , at that time , to be a sea of E@@ den , but now we know , and now we are fac@@ ing par@@ adi@@ se lost .
I want to share with you my person@@ al vie@@ w of chan@@ ges in the sea that af@@ fec@@ t all of us , and to consi@@ der why it ma@@ t@@ ters that in 50 years , we &apos;ve lost — actually , we &apos;ve ta@@ ken , we &apos;ve e@@ a@@ ten — more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that ne@@ ar@@ ly half of the coral re@@ ef@@ s have disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed ; why a my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous de@@ ple@@ tion of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen in lar@@ ge are@@ as of the P@@ a@@ ci@@ fic should con@@ cer@@ n not only the cre@@ atur@@ es that are d@@ ying , but it really should con@@ cer@@ n you .
It does con@@ cer@@ n you , as well .
I &apos;m ha@@ un@@ ted by the thought of what R@@ ay An@@ der@@ son cal@@ ls &quot; &quot; to@@ mor@@ row &apos;s child , &quot; &quot; as@@ king why we didn &apos;t do something on our wat@@ ch to sa@@ ve shar@@ ks and b@@ lu@@ ef@@ in tun@@ a and s@@ qui@@ ds and coral re@@ ef@@ s and the living ocean while there still was time .
Well , now is that time .
I hope for your help to ex@@ pl@@ ore and protec@@ t the w@@ il@@ d ocean in ways that will r@@ est@@ ore the health and , in so doing , se@@ cur@@ e hope for human@@ kind .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th to the ocean means health for us .
And I hope J@@ ill T@@ ar@@ ter &apos;s wis@@ h to eng@@ age Ear@@ th@@ l@@ ings inclu@@ des dol@@ ph@@ ins and wh@@ al@@ es and other sea cre@@ atur@@ es in this qu@@ est to find inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent life el@@ se@@ where in the universe .
And I hope , J@@ ill , that some@@ day we will find evi@@ den@@ ce that there is inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent life a@@ mon@@ g human@@ s on this plan@@ et .
( Laughter ) D@@ id I say that ? I gu@@ ess I did .
For me , as a scienti@@ st , it all beg@@ an in 19@@ 5@@ 3 when I first tri@@ ed s@@ cu@@ ba .
It &apos;s when I first got to know fish s@@ w@@ im@@ ming in something other than le@@ mon sli@@ ces and bu@@ tter .
I actually love di@@ ving at ni@@ ght ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the da@@ y@@ time .
D@@ i@@ ving day and ni@@ ght was really e@@ as@@ y for me in 19@@ 70 , when I led a te@@ am of aqu@@ an@@ au@@ ts living under@@ water for wee@@ ks at a time — at the same time that a@@ st@@ ron@@ au@@ ts were pu@@ tting their fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ ts on the mo@@ on .
In 19@@ 7@@ 9 I had a chan@@ ce to put my fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ ts on the ocean flo@@ or while using this person@@ al sub@@ mer@@ sible called J@@ i@@ m .
It was six miles of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore and 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 50 fe@@ et down .
It &apos;s one of my fav@@ ori@@ te ba@@ thing su@@ its .
S@@ in@@ ce then , I &apos;ve used about 30 kinds of sub@@ mar@@ in@@ es and I &apos;ve started three comp@@ ani@@ es and a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion called De@@ ep S@@ ear@@ ch to desig@@ n and build syste@@ ms to ac@@ cess the de@@ ep sea .
I led a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c ex@@ pedi@@ tion , the S@@ us@@ tain@@ able Se@@ as ex@@ pedi@@ tions , using these little sub@@ s .
They &apos;re so simple to dri@@ ve that even a scienti@@ st can do it .
And I &apos;m living pro@@ of .
A@@ st@@ ron@@ au@@ ts and aqu@@ an@@ au@@ ts ali@@ ke really ap@@ preci@@ ate the import@@ ance of air , food , water , tem@@ per@@ ature — all the things you need to sta@@ y ali@@ ve in space or under the sea .
I heard a@@ st@@ ro@@ na@@ ut Jo@@ e A@@ ll@@ en ex@@ pla@@ in how he had to learn everything he could about his life sup@@ port system and then do everything he could to take care of his life sup@@ port system ; and then he po@@ in@@ ted to this and he said , &quot; &quot; Li@@ fe sup@@ port system . &quot; &quot; We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it .
The po@@ et Au@@ den said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds have li@@ ved without love ; n@@ one without water . &quot; &quot; N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ se@@ ven percent of Earth &apos;s water is ocean .
No blue , no green .
If you think the ocean isn &apos;t important , imagine Earth without it .
Mar@@ s comes to mind .
No ocean , no life sup@@ port system .
I ga@@ ve a talk not so long ago at the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank and I sho@@ w@@ ed this amazing ima@@ ge of Earth and I said , &quot; &quot; There it is ! The W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank ! &quot; &quot; That &apos;s where all the as@@ se@@ ts are !
And we &apos;ve been tra@@ w@@ ling them down much fas@@ ter than the natural syste@@ ms can re@@ pl@@ en@@ is@@ h them .
Ti@@ m W@@ or@@ th says the econo@@ my is a wh@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ o@@ w@@ ned sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary of the environment .
W@@ ith every dro@@ p of water you dr@@ in@@ k , every bre@@ ath you take , you &apos;re connec@@ ted to the sea .
No matter where on Earth you live .
Mo@@ st of the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen in the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere is gener@@ ated by the sea .
O@@ ver time , most of the plan@@ et &apos;s organi@@ c car@@ b@@ on has been ab@@ sor@@ bed and sto@@ red there , most@@ ly by micro@@ b@@ es .
The ocean dri@@ ves climate and we@@ a@@ ther , sta@@ bili@@ z@@ es tem@@ per@@ ature , s@@ hap@@ es Earth &apos;s che@@ mi@@ stry .
W@@ ater from the sea for@@ ms cl@@ ou@@ ds that re@@ turn to the land and the se@@ as as ra@@ in , s@@ le@@ et and s@@ now , and pro@@ vi@@ des home for about 9@@ 7 percent of life in the world , maybe in the universe .
No water , no life ; no blue , no green .
Y@@ et we have this idea , we human@@ s , that the Earth — all of it : the oce@@ ans , the s@@ ki@@ es — are so v@@ ast and so res@@ ili@@ ent it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .
That may have been true 10@@ ,000 years ago , and maybe even 1@@ ,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especi@@ ally in the last 50 , we &apos;ve dra@@ wn down the as@@ se@@ ts , the air , the water , the w@@ il@@ d@@ life that make our lives possible .
Ne@@ w technolo@@ gi@@ es are hel@@ ping us to understand the n@@ ature of n@@ ature ; the n@@ ature of what &apos;s happen@@ ing , sho@@ wing us our impac@@ t on the Earth .
I mean , first you have to know that you &apos;ve got a problem .
And for@@ tun@@ ately , in our time , we &apos;ve learned more about the problems than in all pre@@ ce@@ ding hist@@ ory .
And with kno@@ wing comes car@@ ing .
And with car@@ ing , there &apos;s hope that we can find an en@@ dur@@ ing place for ourselves within the natural syste@@ ms that sup@@ port us .
But first we have to know .
Th@@ ree years ago , I me@@ t Jo@@ h@@ n H@@ an@@ ke , who &apos;s the head of Goog@@ le Earth , and I told him how much I lo@@ ved being able to h@@ old the world in my han@@ ds and go ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing vi@@ car@@ i@@ ously .
But I asked him : &quot; &quot; When are you going to fin@@ is@@ h it ?
You did a great job with the land , the di@@ r@@ t .
What about the water ? &quot; &quot; S@@ in@@ ce then , I &apos;ve had the great ple@@ as@@ ure of working with the Goog@@ l@@ ers , with D@@ O@@ E@@ R Mar@@ ine , with Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c , with do@@ z@@ ens of the best institu@@ tions and scienti@@ sts around the world , ones that we could en@@ li@@ st , to put the ocean in Goog@@ le Earth .
And as of just this wee@@ k , last M@@ on@@ day , Goog@@ le Earth is now whole .
Con@@ si@@ der this : S@@ tar@@ ting right here at the conven@@ tion cen@@ ter , we can find the ne@@ ar@@ by aqu@@ ari@@ um , we can look at where we &apos;re si@@ tting , and then we can cru@@ i@@ se up the co@@ ast to the big aqu@@ ari@@ um , the ocean , and C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a &apos;s four national mar@@ ine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ari@@ es , and the new ne@@ t@@ work of sta@@ te mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ves that are beg@@ in@@ ning to protec@@ t and r@@ est@@ ore some of the as@@ se@@ ts We can fli@@ t over to Ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i and see the real Ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i@@ an Is@@ lan@@ ds : not just the little bit that po@@ kes through the sur@@ face , but also what &apos;s be@@ low .
To see — wa@@ it a minu@@ te , we can go k@@ sh@@ h@@ pla@@ sh ! — right there , ha — under the ocean , see what the wh@@ al@@ es see .
We can go ex@@ pl@@ ore the other side of the Ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i@@ an Is@@ lan@@ ds .
We can go actually and s@@ wi@@ m around on Goog@@ le Earth and visi@@ t with hu@@ mp@@ back wh@@ al@@ es .
These are the g@@ ent@@ le gi@@ an@@ ts that I &apos;ve had the ple@@ as@@ ure of me@@ e@@ ting face to face many times under@@ water .
There &apos;s nothing quite like being person@@ ally in@@ spec@@ ted by a wh@@ al@@ e .
We can pic@@ k up and f@@ ly to the de@@ e@@ p@@ est place : se@@ ven miles down , the M@@ ari@@ ana T@@ ren@@ ch , where only two people have ever been .
Ima@@ g@@ ine that . It &apos;s only se@@ ven miles , but only two people have been there , 4@@ 9 years ago .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ way tri@@ ps are e@@ as@@ y .
We need new de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ mar@@ in@@ es .
How about some X Pri@@ z@@ es for ocean ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation ?
We need to see de@@ ep tr@@ en@@ ches , the under@@ sea moun@@ ta@@ ins , and understand life in the de@@ ep sea .
We can now go to the Ar@@ c@@ tic .
J@@ ust ten years ago I sto@@ od on the ice at the Nor@@ th Po@@ le .
A@@ n ic@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ ree Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an may happen in this cent@@ ur@@ y .
That &apos;s bad news for the po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
Ex@@ cess car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ xi@@ de is not only dri@@ ving global war@@ ming , it &apos;s also chan@@ ging ocean che@@ mi@@ stry , making the sea more a@@ ci@@ di@@ c .
That &apos;s bad news for coral re@@ ef@@ s and o@@ x@@ y@@ gen@@ -@@ produc@@ ing plan@@ k@@ ton .
Al@@ so it &apos;s bad news for us .
We &apos;re pu@@ tting hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of t@@ ons of pla@@ stic and other tra@@ sh into the sea .
M@@ il@@ li@@ ons of t@@ ons of dis@@ car@@ ded fi@@ sh@@ ing ne@@ ts , ge@@ ar that continu@@ es to k@@ ill .
We &apos;re clo@@ gg@@ ing the ocean , po@@ is@@ on@@ ing the plan@@ et &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ la@@ t@@ ory system , and we &apos;re taking out hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of t@@ ons of w@@ il@@ d@@ life , all car@@ bon@@ -@@ based un@@ its .
B@@ ar@@ bar@@ ic@@ ally , we &apos;re ki@@ lling shar@@ ks for shar@@ k fin s@@ ou@@ p , under@@ min@@ ing food cha@@ ins that s@@ hap@@ e plane@@ tar@@ y che@@ mi@@ stry and dri@@ ve the car@@ b@@ on cy@@ cle , the n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen cy@@ cle , the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen cy@@ cle , the water cy@@ cle — our life sup@@ port system .
We &apos;re still ki@@ lling b@@ lu@@ ef@@ in tun@@ a ; tru@@ ly en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed and much more valu@@ able ali@@ ve than de@@ ad .
All of these par@@ ts are part of our life sup@@ port system .
We k@@ ill using long lin@@ es , with ba@@ i@@ ted ho@@ o@@ ks every few fe@@ et that may stre@@ t@@ ch for 50 miles or more .
In@@ du@@ stri@@ al tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers and dra@@ gg@@ ers are s@@ cra@@ ping the sea flo@@ or like bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers , taking everything in their pa@@ th .
U@@ sing Goog@@ le Earth you can w@@ it@@ ness tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers — in Ch@@ ina , the Nor@@ th Se@@ a , the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ico — s@@ ha@@ king the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of our life sup@@ port system , lea@@ ving p@@ lu@@ mes of death in their pa@@ th .
The next time you d@@ ine on s@@ us@@ h@@ i — or sa@@ shi@@ m@@ i , or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish ste@@ ak , or sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il , w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver w@@ il@@ d@@ life you happen to en@@ jo@@ y from the ocean — think of the real co@@ st .
For every po@@ und that goes to mar@@ ket , more than 10 po@@ unds , even 100 po@@ unds , may be th@@ ro@@ wn away as b@@ y@@ ca@@ t@@ ch .
This is the conse@@ qu@@ ence of not kno@@ wing that there are limi@@ ts to what we can take out of the sea .
This char@@ t sho@@ ws the de@@ c@@ line in ocean w@@ il@@ d@@ life from 19@@ 00 to 2@@ 000 .
The high@@ est con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tions are in red .
In my li@@ fe@@ time , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been k@@ il@@ led .
Mo@@ st of the tur@@ t@@ les , shar@@ ks , tun@@ as and wh@@ al@@ es are way down in nu@@ mb@@ ers .
But , there is good news .
Ten percent of the big fish still rema@@ in .
There are still some blue wh@@ al@@ es .
There are still some k@@ ri@@ ll in An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica .
There are a few o@@ y@@ st@@ ers in Ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke B@@ ay .
H@@ al@@ f the coral re@@ ef@@ s are still in pretty good s@@ hap@@ e , a j@@ e@@ we@@ led be@@ l@@ t around the mi@@ d@@ dle of the plan@@ et .
There &apos;s still time , but not a lot , to turn things around .
But bus@@ in@@ ess as us@@ u@@ al means that in 50 years , there may be no coral re@@ ef@@ s — and no com@@ mer@@ cial fi@@ sh@@ ing , because the fish will simply be g@@ one .
Ima@@ g@@ ine the ocean without fish .
Ima@@ g@@ ine what that means to our life sup@@ port system .
N@@ atu@@ ral syste@@ ms on the land are in big t@@ rou@@ ble too , but the problems are more obvi@@ ous , and some ac@@ tions are being ta@@ ken to protec@@ t tre@@ es , wa@@ ter@@ s@@ he@@ ds and w@@ il@@ d@@ life .
And in 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 2 , with Y@@ el@@ low@@ st@@ one Na@@ tional Par@@ k , the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes beg@@ an esta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ing a system of par@@ ks that some say was the best idea America ever had .
A@@ b@@ out 12 percent of the land around the world is now protec@@ ted : sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding bio@@ diversi@@ ty , pro@@ vi@@ ding a car@@ b@@ on sin@@ k , gener@@ ating o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , protec@@ ting wa@@ ter@@ s@@ he@@ ds .
And , in 19@@ 7@@ 2 , this na@@ tion beg@@ an to esta@@ bli@@ sh a coun@@ ter@@ part in the sea , Na@@ tional Mar@@ ine S@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ari@@ es .
That &apos;s another great idea .
The good news is that there are now more than 4@@ ,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protec@@ tion .
And you can find them on Goog@@ le Earth .
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
In the last three years , for example , the U.@@ S@@ . protec@@ ted 3@@ 4@@ 0@@ ,000 s@@ qu@@ are miles of ocean as national mon@@ u@@ ments .
But it only incre@@ a@@ sed from 0@@ .@@ 6 of one percent to 0@@ .@@ 8 of one percent of the ocean protec@@ ted , glob@@ ally .
Pro@@ tec@@ ted are@@ as do re@@ bo@@ und , but it takes a long time to r@@ est@@ ore 5@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -old ro@@ c@@ k@@ fish or mon@@ k@@ fish , shar@@ ks or sea bas@@ s , or 200@@ -@@ year@@ -old or@@ an@@ ge rou@@ gh@@ y .
We don &apos;t consu@@ me 200@@ -@@ year@@ -old co@@ ws or ch@@ ick@@ ens .
Pro@@ tec@@ ted are@@ as pro@@ vi@@ de hope that the cre@@ atur@@ es of E@@ d W@@ il@@ son &apos;s dre@@ am of an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia of life , or the cen@@ su@@ s of mar@@ ine life , will live not just as a li@@ st , a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h , or a par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h .
W@@ ith scienti@@ sts around the world , I &apos;ve been looking at the 9@@ 9 percent of the ocean that is open to fi@@ sh@@ ing — and min@@ ing , and dri@@ lling , and du@@ mp@@ ing , and w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver — to se@@ ar@@ ch out hope s@@ po@@ ts , and try to find ways to give them and us a se@@ cur@@ e future .
S@@ uch as the Ar@@ c@@ tic — we have one chan@@ ce , right now , to get it right .
O@@ r the An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic , where the contin@@ ent is protec@@ ted , but the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding ocean is being stri@@ p@@ ped of its k@@ ri@@ ll , wh@@ al@@ es and fish .
S@@ ar@@ g@@ as@@ so Se@@ a &apos;s three million s@@ qu@@ are miles of flo@@ ating for@@ est is being ga@@ ther@@ ed up to fe@@ ed co@@ ws .
9@@ 7 percent of the land in the G@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ gos Is@@ lan@@ ds is protec@@ ted , but the ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent sea is being ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed by fi@@ sh@@ ing .
It &apos;s true too in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina on the P@@ a@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ i@@ an sh@@ el@@ f , which is now in seri@@ ous t@@ rou@@ ble .
The high se@@ as , where wh@@ al@@ es , tun@@ a and dol@@ ph@@ ins tra@@ vel — the lar@@ g@@ est , le@@ ast protec@@ ted , eco@@ system on Earth , fil@@ led with lu@@ min@@ ous cre@@ atur@@ es , living in dar@@ k wa@@ ters that a@@ ver@@ age two miles de@@ ep .
They f@@ la@@ sh , and s@@ par@@ k@@ le , and glo@@ w with their own living light .
There are still places in the sea as pri@@ st@@ ine as I knew as a child .
The next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10@@ ,000 years the best chan@@ ce our species will have to protec@@ t what rema@@ ins of the natural syste@@ ms that give us life .
To co@@ pe with climate change , we need new ways to gener@@ ate power .
We need new ways , better ways , to co@@ pe with po@@ ver@@ ty , war@@ s and disease .
We need many things to keep and ma@@ in@@ tain the world as a better place .
But , nothing else will matter if we fa@@ il to protec@@ t the ocean .
Ou@@ r fa@@ te and the ocean &apos;s are one .
We need to do for the ocean what A@@ l G@@ ore did for the s@@ ki@@ es ab@@ o@@ ve .
A global pla@@ n of ac@@ tion with a world con@@ ser@@ va@@ tion uni@@ on , the I@@ U@@ C@@ N , is under@@ way to protec@@ t bio@@ diversi@@ ty , to mi@@ ti@@ ga@@ te and reco@@ ver from the impac@@ ts of climate change , on the high se@@ as and in co@@ as@@ tal are@@ as , wh@@ er@@ ever we can identi@@ f@@ y cri@@ tical places .
Ne@@ w technolo@@ gi@@ es are nee@@ ded to ma@@ p , phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h and ex@@ pl@@ ore the 9@@ 5 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see .
The go@@ al is to protec@@ t bio@@ diversi@@ ty , to pro@@ vi@@ de sta@@ bility and res@@ ili@@ ence .
We need de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ s , new technolo@@ gi@@ es to ex@@ pl@@ ore the ocean .
We need , maybe , an ex@@ pedi@@ tion — a TED at sea — that could help figur@@ e out the next ste@@ ps .
And so , I sup@@ pos@@ e you want to know what my wis@@ h is .
I wis@@ h you would use all means at your dis@@ pos@@ al — fil@@ ms , ex@@ pedi@@ tions , the we@@ b , new sub@@ mar@@ in@@ es — and cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to i@@ gni@@ te publi@@ c sup@@ port for a global ne@@ t@@ work of mar@@ ine protec@@ ted are@@ as — hope s@@ po@@ ts lar@@ ge enough to sa@@ ve and r@@ est@@ ore the ocean , the blue heart of the plan@@ et .
How much ?
So@@ me say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
You deci@@ de : how much of your heart do you want to protec@@ t ?
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it is , a f@@ rac@@ tion of one percent is not enough .
My wis@@ h is a big wis@@ h , but if we can make it happen , it can tru@@ ly change the world , and help en@@ sure the sur@@ viv@@ al of what actually — as it tur@@ ns out — is my fav@@ ori@@ te species ; that would be us .
For the children of today , for to@@ mor@@ row &apos;s child : as never again , now is the time .
Thank you .

I was only four years old when I saw my mother lo@@ ad a was@@ hing mach@@ ine for the very first time in her life .
That was a great day for my mother .
My mother and fa@@ ther had been sa@@ ving money for years to be able to bu@@ y that mach@@ ine , and the first day it was going to be used , even G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma was invi@@ ted to see the mach@@ ine .
And G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma was even more exci@@ ted .
Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out her life she had been he@@ ating water with fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od , and she had hand was@@ h@@ ed la@@ un@@ dr@@ y for se@@ ven children .
And now she was going to wat@@ ch elec@@ tri@@ city do that work .
My mother car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or , and she lo@@ a@@ ded the la@@ un@@ dr@@ y into the mach@@ ine , like this .
And then , when she clo@@ sed the do@@ or , G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no .
Let me , let me p@@ us@@ h the bu@@ tt@@ on . &quot; &quot; And G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma p@@ us@@ h@@ ed the bu@@ tt@@ on , and she said , &quot; &quot; Oh , fan@@ ta@@ stic !
I want to see this ! Gi@@ ve me a cha@@ ir !
Gi@@ ve me a cha@@ ir ! I want to see it , &quot; &quot; and she s@@ at down in front of the mach@@ ine , and she wat@@ ched the entire was@@ hing progra@@ m .
She was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed .
To my gran@@ d@@ mother , the was@@ hing mach@@ ine was a mi@@ rac@@ le .
To@@ day , in S@@ we@@ den and other ri@@ ch countries , people are using so many different mach@@ in@@ es .
L@@ oo@@ k , the ho@@ mes are full of mach@@ in@@ es .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
And they also , when they want to tra@@ vel , they use fl@@ ying mach@@ in@@ es that can take them to re@@ m@@ ote dest@@ in@@ ations .
And yet , in the world , there are so many people who still he@@ at the water on fire , and they co@@ ok their food on fire .
So@@ me@@ times they don &apos;t even have enough food , and they live be@@ low the po@@ ver@@ ty line .
There are two billion fel@@ low human be@@ ings who live on less than two dollars a day .
And the ri@@ ch@@ est people over there — there &apos;s one billion people — and they live ab@@ o@@ ve what I call the &quot; &quot; air line , &quot; &quot; because they s@@ pen@@ d more than $ 80 a day on their consu@@ mp@@ tion .
But this is just one , two , three billion people , and obvi@@ ously there are se@@ ven billion people in the world , so there must be one , two , three , four billion people more who live in between the po@@ ver@@ ty and the air line .
They have elec@@ tri@@ city , but the question is , how many have was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es ?
I &apos;ve done the s@@ cru@@ tin@@ y of mar@@ ket data , and I &apos;ve found that , in@@ de@@ ed , the was@@ hing mach@@ ine has pen@@ e@@ tra@@ ted be@@ low the air line , and today there &apos;s an ad@@ di@@ tional one billion people out there who live ab@@ o@@ ve the &quot; &quot; was@@ h line . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they consu@@ me more than $ 40 per day .
So two billion have ac@@ cess to was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es .
And the rema@@ in@@ ing five billion , how do they was@@ h ?
O@@ r , to be more preci@@ se , how do most of the wo@@ men in the world was@@ h ?
Because it rema@@ ins hard work for wo@@ men to was@@ h .
They was@@ h like this : by hand .
It &apos;s a hard , ti@@ me@@ -@@ consu@@ ming la@@ b@@ or , which they have to do for h@@ our@@ s every wee@@ k .
And sometimes they also have to br@@ ing water from far away to do the la@@ un@@ dr@@ y at home , or they have to br@@ ing the la@@ un@@ dr@@ y away to a stre@@ am far off .
And they want the was@@ hing mach@@ ine .
They don &apos;t want to s@@ pen@@ d such a lar@@ ge part of their life doing this hard work with so rela@@ tively low produc@@ tivi@@ ty .
And there &apos;s nothing different in their wis@@ h than it was for my gran@@ d@@ ma .
L@@ oo@@ k here , two gener@@ ations ago in S@@ we@@ den — pic@@ king water from the stre@@ am , he@@ ating with fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od and was@@ hing like that .
They want the was@@ hing mach@@ ine in exactly the same way .
But when I lec@@ ture to environ@@ men@@ tal@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ con@@ cer@@ ned stud@@ ents , they tell me , &quot; &quot; No , every@@ body in the world cannot have car@@ s and was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es . &quot; &quot; How can we tell this woman that she a@@ in &apos;t going to have a was@@ hing mach@@ ine ?
And then I ask my stud@@ ents , I &apos;ve asked them — over the last two years I &apos;ve asked , &quot; How many of you doesn &apos;t use a car ? &quot;
And some of them pro@@ ud@@ ly rai@@ se their hand and say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use a car . &quot; &quot; And then I put the really t@@ ough question : &quot; &quot; How many of you han@@ d-@@ was@@ h your j@@ e@@ ans and your bed s@@ he@@ e@@ ts ? &quot; &quot; And no one rai@@ sed their hand .
E@@ ven the har@@ d@@ co@@ re in the green mo@@ ve@@ ment use was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es .
( Laughter ) So how come &#91; this is &#93; something that everyone us@@ es and they think others will not stop it ? What is spe@@ cial with this ?
I had to do an anal@@ y@@ sis about the energy used in the world .
Here we are .
L@@ oo@@ k here , you see the se@@ ven billion people up there : the air people , the was@@ h people , the bul@@ b people and the fire people .
One un@@ it like this is an energy un@@ it of fo@@ s@@ si@@ l fu@@ el — oil , co@@ al or gas .
That &apos;s what most of elec@@ tri@@ city and the energy in the world is .
And it &apos;s 12 un@@ its used in the entire world , and the ri@@ ch@@ est one billion , they use six of them .
H@@ al@@ f of the energy is used by one se@@ v@@ ent@@ h of the world &apos;s population .
And these ones who have was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es , but not a house full of other mach@@ in@@ es , they use two .
This gro@@ up us@@ es three , one each .
And they also have elec@@ tri@@ city .
And over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
That makes 12 of them .
But the ma@@ in con@@ cer@@ n for the environ@@ men@@ tal@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ interes@@ ted stud@@ ents — and they are right — is about the future .
What are the tr@@ ends ? If we just pro@@ long the tr@@ ends , without any real ad@@ van@@ ced anal@@ y@@ sis , to 20@@ 50 , there are two things that can incre@@ ase the energy use .
F@@ ir@@ st , population gro@@ w@@ th .
Se@@ con@@ d , econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th .
P@@ op@@ u@@ lation gro@@ w@@ th will ma@@ in@@ ly oc@@ cu@@ r a@@ mon@@ g the po@@ or@@ est people here because they have high child mor@@ tal@@ ity and they have many children per woman .
And &#91; with &#93; that you will get two ex@@ tra , but that w@@ on &apos;t change the energy use very much .
What will happen is econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th .
The best of here in the emer@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es — I call them the Ne@@ w E@@ ast — they will j@@ u@@ m@@ p the air line .
&quot; &quot; W@@ op@@ p ! &quot; &quot; they will say .
And they will start to use as much as the O@@ ld W@@ est are doing already .
And these people , they want the was@@ hing mach@@ ine .
I told you . They &apos;ll go there .
And they will dou@@ ble their energy use .
And we hope that the po@@ or people will get into the elec@@ tri@@ c light .
And they &apos;ll get a tw@@ o@@ -@@ child family without a stop in population gro@@ w@@ th .
But the tot@@ al energy consu@@ mp@@ tion will incre@@ ase to 2@@ 2 un@@ its .
And these 2@@ 2 un@@ its — still the ri@@ ch@@ est people use most of it .
So what nee@@ ds to be done ?
Because the ris@@ k , the high probab@@ ili@@ ty of climate change is real .
It &apos;s real .
O@@ f course they must be more ener@@ g@@ y@@ -@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent .
They must change behavi@@ or in some way .
They must also start to produ@@ ce green energy , much more green energy .
But until they have the same energy consu@@ mp@@ tion per person , they sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t give ad@@ vi@@ ce to others — what to do and what not to do .
( Applause ) Here we can get more green energy all over .
This is what we hope may happen .
It &apos;s a real ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge in the future .
But I can as@@ sure you that this woman in the fa@@ vel@@ a in R@@ io , she wan@@ ts a was@@ hing mach@@ ine .
She &apos;s very happ@@ y about her min@@ is@@ ter of energy that pro@@ vi@@ ded elec@@ tri@@ city to everyone — so happ@@ y that she even vo@@ ted for her .
And she became D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff , the pres@@ id@@ ent@@ -@@ elec@@ t of one of the bi@@ gg@@ est democra@@ ci@@ es in the world — mo@@ ving from min@@ is@@ ter of energy to pres@@ id@@ ent .
If you have democra@@ cy , people will v@@ ote for was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ es .
They love them .
And what &apos;s the ma@@ gi@@ c with them ?
My mother ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed the ma@@ gi@@ c with this mach@@ ine the very , very first day .
She said , &quot; &quot; Now H@@ ans , we have lo@@ a@@ ded the la@@ un@@ dr@@ y .
The mach@@ ine will make the work .
And now we can go to the li@@ br@@ ary . &quot; &quot; Because this is the ma@@ gi@@ c : you lo@@ ad the la@@ un@@ dr@@ y , and what do you get out of the mach@@ ine ?
You get bo@@ o@@ ks out of the mach@@ in@@ es , children &apos;s bo@@ o@@ ks .
And mother got time to read for me .
She lo@@ ved this . I got the &quot; &quot; A@@ B@@ C &apos;s &quot; &quot; — this is where I started my car@@ e@@ er as a profes@@ s@@ or , when my mother had time to read for me .
And she also got bo@@ o@@ ks for her@@ self .
She man@@ ag@@ ed to study English and learn that as a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n language .
And she read so many nov@@ els , so many different nov@@ els here .
And we really , we really lo@@ ved this mach@@ ine .
And what we said , my mother and me , &quot; &quot; Thank you industri@@ aliz@@ ation .
Thank you ste@@ el mi@@ ll .
Thank you power sta@@ tion .
And th@@ ank you che@@ mi@@ cal pro@@ ces@@ sing indu@@ stry that ga@@ ve us time to read bo@@ o@@ ks . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

You may not realiz@@ e this , but there are more bacteria in your body than star@@ s in our entire gal@@ ax@@ y .
This fas@@ cin@@ ating universe of bacteria inside of us is an inte@@ gra@@ l part of our health , and our technology is e@@ vol@@ ving so ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly that today we can progra@@ m these bacteria like we progra@@ m compu@@ ters .
Now , the diag@@ ra@@ m that you see here , I know it loo@@ ks like some kind of s@@ por@@ ts play , but it is actually a b@@ lu@@ e@@ pr@@ int of the first bacteri@@ al progra@@ m I developed .
And like wri@@ ting sof@@ tw@@ are , we can pr@@ int and wri@@ te DNA into different alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms and progra@@ ms inside of bacteria .
What this progra@@ m does is produc@@ es f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent prote@@ ins in a r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic fas@@ hi@@ on and gener@@ ates a small mole@@ cu@@ le that al@@ lo@@ ws bacteria to communi@@ cate and sy@@ n@@ ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ ze , as you &apos;re see@@ ing in this mo@@ vi@@ e .
The gro@@ wing co@@ lon@@ y of bacteria that you see here is about the wi@@ d@@ th of a human ha@@ ir .
Now , what you can &apos;t see is that our genetic progra@@ m in@@ struc@@ ts these bacteria to each produ@@ ce small mole@@ cul@@ es , and these mole@@ cul@@ es tra@@ vel between the thousands of individu@@ al bacteria telling them when to turn on and off .
And the bacteria sy@@ n@@ ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ ze quite well at this s@@ cal@@ e , but because the mole@@ cu@@ le that sy@@ n@@ ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ z@@ es them together can only tra@@ vel so f@@ ast , in lar@@ ger co@@ lon@@ ies of bacteria , this resul@@ ts in tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ves between bacteria that are far away from each other , and you can see these wa@@ ves going from right to left across the s@@ cre@@ en .
You can obser@@ ve qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing in ac@@ tion in this mo@@ vi@@ e , where a gro@@ wing co@@ lon@@ y of bacteria only beg@@ ins to glo@@ w on@@ ce it re@@ ach@@ es a high or cri@@ tical den@@ si@@ ty .
Ou@@ r genetic progra@@ m continu@@ es produc@@ ing these r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic pa@@ tter@@ ns of f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent prote@@ ins as the co@@ lon@@ y gro@@ ws ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ ds .
This particular mo@@ vi@@ e and experi@@ ment we call The Su@@ per@@ nova , because it loo@@ ks like an ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ding s@@ tar .
Now , b@@ esi@@ des progra@@ mm@@ ing these beautiful pa@@ tter@@ ns , I wonder@@ ed , what else can we get these bacteria to do ?
And I decided to ex@@ pl@@ ore how we can progra@@ m bacteria to detec@@ t and tre@@ at dise@@ ases in our bo@@ dies like cancer .
One of the sur@@ pri@@ sing fac@@ ts about bacteria is that they can n@@ atur@@ ally grow inside of tu@@ mor@@ s .
This happens because ty@@ pic@@ ally tu@@ mor@@ s are are@@ as where the im@@ mun@@ e system has no ac@@ cess , and so bacteria find these tu@@ mor@@ s and use them as a sa@@ fe ha@@ ven to grow and th@@ ri@@ ve .
We started using pro@@ bio@@ tic bacteria which are sa@@ fe bacteria that have a health ben@@ ef@@ it , and found that when or@@ ally de@@ li@@ vered to mi@@ ce , these pro@@ bio@@ tics would se@@ lec@@ tively grow inside of li@@ ver tu@@ mor@@ s .
We realiz@@ ed that the most conven@@ i@@ ent way to high@@ light the pres@@ ence of the pro@@ bio@@ tics , and h@@ ence , the pres@@ ence of the tu@@ mor@@ s , was to get these bacteria to produ@@ ce a si@@ gn@@ al that would be detec@@ table in the ur@@ ine , and so we speci@@ fi@@ cally progra@@ m@@ med these pro@@ bio@@ tics to make a mole@@ cu@@ le that would change the col@@ or of your ur@@ ine to indi@@ cate the pres@@ ence of cancer .
We went on to show that this technology could sen@@ si@@ tively and speci@@ fi@@ cally detec@@ t li@@ ver cancer , one that is ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ing to detec@@ t o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se .
Now , sin@@ ce these bacteria speci@@ fi@@ cally lo@@ c@@ aliz@@ e to tu@@ mor@@ s , we &apos;ve been progra@@ mm@@ ing them to not only detec@@ t cancer but also to tre@@ at cancer by produc@@ ing ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic mole@@ cul@@ es from within the tu@@ mor environment that sh@@ r@@ in@@ k the exist@@ ing tu@@ mor@@ s , and we &apos;ve been doing this using qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing progra@@ ms like you saw in the pre@@ vi@@ ous mo@@ vi@@ es .
Al@@ together , imagine in the future taking a progra@@ m@@ med pro@@ bio@@ tic that could detec@@ t and tre@@ at cancer , or even other dise@@ ases .
Ou@@ r ability to progra@@ m bacteria and progra@@ m life op@@ ens up new h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons in cancer research , and to share this vi@@ sion , I worked with arti@@ st Vi@@ k M@@ uni@@ z to create the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the universe , made enti@@ re@@ ly out of bacteria or cancer cells .
U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , my hope is that the be@@ au@@ ty and pur@@ pos@@ e of this micro@@ s@@ co@@ pi@@ c universe can in@@ spi@@ re new and crea@@ tive appro@@ ach@@ es for the future of cancer research .
Thank you .

When I was se@@ ven years old , some w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ me@@ an@@ ing adul@@ t asked me what I wanted to be when I gre@@ w up .
P@@ rou@@ d@@ ly , I said : &quot; &quot; A@@ n arti@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , you don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; You can &apos;t make a living being an arti@@ st ! &quot;
My little se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -old P@@ i@@ ca@@ s@@ so dre@@ a@@ ms were cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed .
But I ga@@ ther@@ ed myself , went off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new dre@@ am , ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally se@@ tt@@ ling on being a scienti@@ st , per@@ haps something like the next Al@@ ber@@ t E@@ in@@ ste@@ in .
( Laughter ) I have always lo@@ ved ma@@ th and science , later , co@@ ding .
And so I decided to study computer progra@@ mm@@ ing in colle@@ ge .
In my j@@ uni@@ or year , my computer gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s profes@@ s@@ or sho@@ w@@ ed us these wonderful sh@@ or@@ t fil@@ ms .
It was the first computer anima@@ tion any of us had ever seen .
I wat@@ ched these fil@@ ms in won@@ der , trans@@ fix@@ ed , fi@@ re@@ works going off in my head , thinking , &quot; &quot; That is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; The idea that all the ma@@ th , science and co@@ de I had been learning could come together to create these wor@@ l@@ ds and char@@ ac@@ ters and stories I connec@@ ted with , was p@@ ure ma@@ gi@@ c for me .
J@@ ust two years later , I started working at the place that made those fil@@ ms , P@@ ix@@ ar An@@ ima@@ tion S@@ tu@@ di@@ os .
It was here I learned how we actually ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te those fil@@ ms .
We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that cre@@ ates char@@ ac@@ ters , or tre@@ es and ro@@ c@@ ks that ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally become a for@@ est .
And because it &apos;s a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world , we can move a cam@@ era around inside that world .
I was fas@@ cin@@ ated by all of it .
But then I got my first tas@@ te of li@@ gh@@ ting .
Li@@ gh@@ ting in prac@@ tice is pl@@ ac@@ ing li@@ ghts inside this th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world .
I actually have i@@ con@@ s of li@@ ghts I move around in there .
Here you can see I &apos;ve ad@@ ded a light , I &apos;m tur@@ ning on the rou@@ gh ver@@ sion of li@@ gh@@ ting in our sof@@ tw@@ are , turn on s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws and pl@@ ac@@ ing the light .
As I place a light , I think about what it might look like in real life , but bal@@ ance that out with what we need arti@@ stic@@ ally and for the story .
So it might look like this at first , but as we ad@@ just this and move that in wee@@ ks of work , in rou@@ gh form it might look like this , and in final form , like this .
There &apos;s this moment in li@@ gh@@ ting that made me f@@ all u@@ tter@@ ly in love with it .
It &apos;s where we go from this to this .
It &apos;s the moment where all the pi@@ eces come together , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly the world comes to life as if it &apos;s an actual place that exist@@ s .
This moment never gets old , especi@@ ally for that little se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -old gir@@ l that wanted to be an arti@@ st .
D@@ id you see W@@ A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ E ?
( Laughter ) There he is .
As you can see , we can create any world that we want inside the computer .
We can make a world with mon@@ st@@ ers , with ro@@ bot@@ s that f@@ all in love , we can even make pi@@ gs f@@ ly .
( Laughter ) W@@ hi@@ le this is an incre@@ di@@ ble thing , this un@@ te@@ ther@@ ed arti@@ stic f@@ ree@@ dom , it can create cha@@ os .
It can create un@@ belie@@ v@@ able wor@@ l@@ ds , un@@ belie@@ v@@ able mo@@ ve@@ ment , things that are j@@ ar@@ r@@ ing to the audi@@ ence .
So to com@@ b@@ at this , we te@@ ther ourselves with science .
We use science and the world we know as a bac@@ k@@ b@@ one , to ground ourselves in something rela@@ table and recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; &quot; Fin@@ ding Ne@@ mo &quot; &quot; is an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent example of this .
A ma@@ j@@ or por@@ tion of the mo@@ vi@@ e takes place under@@ water .
But how do you make it look under@@ water ?
Then we bro@@ ke it back down to see which ele@@ ments make up that under@@ water look .
One of the most cri@@ tical ele@@ ments was how the light tra@@ vel@@ s through the water .
So we co@@ ded up a light that mi@@ mi@@ cs this physi@@ cs — first , the visi@@ bility of the water , and then what happens with the col@@ or .
O@@ b@@ jects clo@@ se to the ey@@ e have their full , ri@@ ch col@@ ors .
As light tra@@ vel@@ s de@@ e@@ per into the water , we lo@@ se the red wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths , then the green wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths , lea@@ ving us with blue at the far de@@ p@@ ths .
In this cli@@ p you can see two other important ele@@ ments .
The first is the sur@@ ge and s@@ well , or the invi@@ sible under@@ water cur@@ r@@ ent that p@@ us@@ h@@ es the b@@ its of partic@@ u@@ late around in the water .
The second is the caus@@ tics .
These are the ri@@ b@@ b@@ ons of light , like you might see on the bot@@ to@@ m of a po@@ ol , that are cre@@ ated when the s@@ un ben@@ ds through the cr@@ est@@ s of the ri@@ p@@ pl@@ es and wa@@ ves on the ocean &apos;s sur@@ face .
Here we have the fo@@ g be@@ a@@ ms .
The other really co@@ ol thing you can see here is that we li@@ t that partic@@ u@@ late only with the caus@@ tics , so that as it goes in and out of those ri@@ b@@ b@@ ons of light , it ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s and disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ s , len@@ ding a sub@@ t@@ le , ma@@ gi@@ cal s@@ par@@ k@@ le to the under@@ water .
You can see how we &apos;re using the science — the physi@@ cs of water , light and mo@@ ve@@ ment — to te@@ ther that arti@@ stic f@@ ree@@ dom .
But we are not be@@ h@@ ol@@ den to it .
We consider@@ ed each of these ele@@ ments and which ones had to be scienti@@ fi@@ cally ac@@ cu@@ rate and which ones we could p@@ us@@ h and pul@@ l to su@@ it the story and the mo@@ od .
We realiz@@ ed early on that col@@ or was one we had some le@@ e@@ way with .
So here &apos;s a tradi@@ tion@@ ally co@@ lo@@ red under@@ water s@@ cen@@ e .
But here , we can take S@@ y@@ d@@ ne@@ y H@@ ar@@ b@@ or and p@@ us@@ h it fa@@ ir@@ ly green to su@@ it the sa@@ d mo@@ od of what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
In this s@@ cen@@ e , it &apos;s really important we see de@@ ep into the under@@ water , so we understand what the E@@ ast Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent is , that the tur@@ t@@ les are di@@ ving into and going on this ro@@ ll@@ er co@@ as@@ ter ri@@ de .
Because in the end , we are not trying to re@@ create the scienti@@ fi@@ cally correc@@ t real world , we &apos;re trying to create a belie@@ v@@ able world , one the audi@@ ence can im@@ mer@@ se themselves in to experience the story .
We use science to create something wonderful .
We use story and arti@@ stic tou@@ ch to get us to a place of won@@ der .
This guy , W@@ A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ E , is a great example of that .
He fin@@ ds be@@ au@@ ty in the simp@@ l@@ est things .
But when he came in to li@@ gh@@ ting , we knew we had a big problem .
We got so ge@@ e@@ ke@@ d-@@ out on making W@@ A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ E this con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ro@@ bo@@ t , that we made his bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s prac@@ tically op@@ tically perfec@@ t .
( Laughter ) H@@ is bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s are one of the most cri@@ tical ac@@ ting devi@@ ces he has .
He doesn &apos;t have a face or even tradi@@ tional di@@ al@@ o@@ gue , for that matter .
So the anima@@ tors were he@@ avi@@ ly depen@@ d@@ ent on the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s to se@@ ll his ac@@ ting and emo@@ tions .
We started li@@ gh@@ ting and we realiz@@ ed the tri@@ ple len@@ ses inside his bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s were a mes@@ s of ref@@ lec@@ tions .
He was star@@ ting to look g@@ la@@ s@@ sy@@ -@@ ey@@ ed .
( Laughter ) Now , g@@ la@@ s@@ sy@@ -@@ ey@@ ed is a funda@@ ment@@ ally aw@@ ful thing when you are trying to con@@ vin@@ ce an audi@@ ence that a ro@@ bo@@ t has a person@@ ality and he &apos;s cap@@ able of fal@@ ling in love .
So we went to work on these op@@ tically perfec@@ t bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s , trying to find a solu@@ tion that would ma@@ in@@ tain his true ro@@ bo@@ t materi@@ als but sol@@ ve this ref@@ lec@@ tion problem .
So we started with the len@@ ses .
Here &apos;s the f@@ la@@ t@@ -@@ front len@@ s , we have a con@@ ca@@ ve len@@ s and a con@@ ve@@ x len@@ s .
And here you see all three together , sho@@ wing us all these ref@@ lec@@ tions .
We tri@@ ed tur@@ ning them down , we tri@@ ed blo@@ c@@ king them , nothing was working .
You can see here , sometimes we nee@@ ded something speci@@ fic ref@@ lec@@ ted in his eyes — us@@ u@@ ally E@@ ve .
So we coul@@ dn &apos;t just use some fa@@ ked ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t ima@@ ge on the len@@ ses .
So here we have E@@ ve on the first len@@ s , we put E@@ ve on the second len@@ s , it &apos;s not working .
We turn it down , it &apos;s still not working .
And then we have our e@@ u@@ re@@ k@@ a moment .
We ad@@ d a light to W@@ A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ E that ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally lea@@ ks into his eyes .
You can see it light up these gra@@ y a@@ per@@ ture b@@ la@@ des .
I have a question .
C@@ an a computer wri@@ te poe@@ try ?
This is a provo@@ ca@@ tive question .
What is poe@@ try ?
What is crea@@ tivi@@ ty ?
H@@ an@@ ds up if you think Po@@ e@@ m 1 was wri@@ t@@ ten by a human .
V@@ er@@ y bra@@ ve of you , because the first one was wri@@ t@@ ten by the human po@@ et W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke .
So let &apos;s try another test .
A@@ ga@@ in , you ha@@ ven &apos;t got ages to read this , so just tr@@ ust your gu@@ t .
Po@@ e@@ m 2 : Oh ! k@@ an@@ gar@@ o@@ os , se@@ qu@@ ins , cho@@ co@@ late so@@ das ! / You are really beautiful !
So if you think the first poe@@ m was wri@@ t@@ ten by a human , put your hand up .
O@@ K .
And if you think the second poe@@ m was wri@@ t@@ ten by a human , put your hand up .
We have , more or less , a 50 / 50 sp@@ li@@ t here .
It was much har@@ der .
The answer is , the first poe@@ m was gener@@ ated by an alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m called R@@ ac@@ ter , that was cre@@ ated back in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s , and the second poe@@ m was wri@@ t@@ ten by a guy called Fran@@ k O &apos;@@ H@@ ara , who happens to be one of my fav@@ ori@@ te human poe@@ ts .
( Laughter ) So what we &apos;ve just done now is a Tur@@ ing test for poe@@ try .
The Tur@@ ing test was first pro@@ pos@@ ed by this guy , A@@ lan Tur@@ ing , in 19@@ 50 , in order to answer the question , can compu@@ ters think ?
So in 20@@ 1@@ 3 , my fri@@ end B@@ en@@ j@@ a@@ min L@@ a@@ ird and I , we cre@@ ated a Tur@@ ing test for poe@@ try on@@ line .
It &apos;s called bo@@ t or not , and you can go and play it for your@@ selves .
But basi@@ cally , it &apos;s the game we just play@@ ed .
And what are the resul@@ ts ?
Well , Tur@@ ing said that if a computer could fo@@ ol a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human , then it pas@@ ses the Tur@@ ing test for inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce .
We have poe@@ ms on the bo@@ t or not da@@ ta@@ base that have fo@@ o@@ led 6@@ 5 percent of human re@@ a@@ ders into thinking it was wri@@ t@@ ten by a human .
So , I think we have an answer to our question .
Let &apos;s play our th@@ ird and final test .
A@@ ga@@ in , you &apos;re going to have to read and tell me which you think is human .
And Po@@ e@@ m 2 was gener@@ ated by an alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m called R@@ K@@ C@@ P .
Now before we go on , let me descri@@ be very qu@@ ick@@ ly and simply , how R@@ K@@ C@@ P works .
So , you give R@@ K@@ C@@ P a s@@ our@@ ce text , it anal@@ y@@ z@@ es the s@@ our@@ ce text in order to find out how it us@@ es language , and then it re@@ gener@@ ates language that e@@ mu@@ la@@ tes that first text .
It &apos;s just ra@@ w material .
And ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s able to create a poe@@ m that see@@ ms more human than G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in &apos;s poe@@ m , and G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in is a human .
So what we &apos;ve done here is , more or less , a re@@ ver@@ se Tur@@ ing test .
So G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in , who &apos;s a human , is able to wri@@ te a poe@@ m that fo@@ ols a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of human j@@ ud@@ ges into thinking that it was wri@@ t@@ ten by a computer .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the logi@@ c of the re@@ ver@@ se Tur@@ ing test , G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in is a computer .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ el@@ ing con@@ fu@@ sed ?
I think that &apos;s fa@@ ir enough .
So far we &apos;ve had human@@ s that wri@@ te like human@@ s , we have compu@@ ters that wri@@ te like compu@@ ters , we have compu@@ ters that wri@@ te like human@@ s , but we also have , per@@ haps most con@@ f@@ us@@ ing@@ ly , human@@ s that wri@@ te like compu@@ ters .
So what do we take from all of this ?
D@@ o we take that W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke is some@@ how more of a human than G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in ?
O@@ r that G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in is more of a computer than W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke ?
( Laughter ) These are ques@@ tions I &apos;ve been as@@ king myself for around two years now , and I don &apos;t have any ans@@ w@@ ers .
But what I do have are a bun@@ ch of in@@ si@@ ghts about our rela@@ tion@@ ship with technology .
So my first in@@ si@@ ght is that , for some reason , we as@@ soci@@ ate poe@@ try with being human .
So that when we ask , &quot; &quot; C@@ an a computer wri@@ te poe@@ try ? &quot; &quot; we &apos;re also as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What does it mean to be human and how do we put bo@@ und@@ ari@@ es around this ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory ?
How do we say who or what can be part of this ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory ? &quot; &quot; This is an es@@ senti@@ ally phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phi@@ cal question , I believe , and it can &apos;t be ans@@ wer@@ ed with a y@@ es or no test , like the Tur@@ ing test .
I also believe that A@@ lan Tur@@ ing underst@@ o@@ od this , and that when he devi@@ sed his test back in 19@@ 50 , he was doing it as a phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phi@@ cal provo@@ cation .
So my second in@@ si@@ ght is that , when we take the Tur@@ ing test for poe@@ try , we &apos;re not really t@@ esting the capaci@@ ty of the compu@@ ters because poe@@ tr@@ y@@ -@@ gener@@ ating alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , they &apos;re pretty simple and have exis@@ ted , more or less , sin@@ ce the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
What we are doing with the Tur@@ ing test for poe@@ try , ra@@ ther , is col@@ lec@@ ting op@@ ini@@ ons about what con@@ stitu@@ tes human@@ ness .
So , what I &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red out , we &apos;ve seen this when ear@@ li@@ er today , we say that W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke is more of a human than G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in .
O@@ f course , this doesn &apos;t mean that W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke was actually more human or that G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in was more of a computer .
It simply means that the ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory of the human is un@@ sta@@ ble .
This has led me to understand that the human is not a co@@ ld , hard fact .
R@@ a@@ ther , it is something that &apos;s con@@ struc@@ ted with our op@@ ini@@ ons and something that chan@@ ges over time .
So my final in@@ si@@ ght is that the computer , more or less , works like a mir@@ ro@@ r that ref@@ lec@@ ts any idea of a human that we show it .
We show it E@@ mi@@ ly D@@ ic@@ kin@@ son , it gi@@ ves E@@ mi@@ ly D@@ ic@@ kin@@ son back to us .
We show it W@@ il@@ li@@ am B@@ la@@ ke , that &apos;s what it ref@@ lec@@ ts back to us .
We show it G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in , what we get back is G@@ er@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in .
M@@ ore than any other bit of technology , the computer is a mir@@ ro@@ r that ref@@ lec@@ ts any idea of the human we te@@ ach it .
So I &apos;m sure a lot of you have been hear@@ ing a lot about arti@@ fici@@ al inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce rec@@ ently .
And much of the conversa@@ tion is , can we build it ?
C@@ an we build an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent computer ?
C@@ an we build a crea@@ tive computer ?
What we see@@ m to be as@@ king over and over is can we build a human@@ -@@ like computer ?
But what we &apos;ve seen just now is that the human is not a scienti@@ fic fact , that it &apos;s an e@@ ver@@ -@@ shi@@ f@@ ting , con@@ ca@@ ten@@ ating idea and one that chan@@ ges over time .
So that when we beg@@ in to gra@@ p@@ ple with the ideas of arti@@ fici@@ al inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce in the future , we sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t only be as@@ king ourselves , &quot; C@@ an we build it ? &quot;
But we should also be as@@ king ourselves , &quot; What idea of the human do we want to have ref@@ lec@@ ted back to us ? &quot;
This is an es@@ senti@@ ally phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phi@@ cal idea , and it &apos;s one that can &apos;t be ans@@ wer@@ ed with sof@@ tw@@ are al@@ one , but I think re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a moment of speci@@ es@@ -@@ wi@@ de , exist@@ enti@@ al ref@@ lec@@ tion .
Thank you .
I@@ s there life be@@ y@@ on@@ d Earth in our solar system ?
W@@ ow , what a power@@ ful question .
You know , as a scienti@@ st — plane@@ tar@@ y scienti@@ st — we really didn &apos;t take that very seri@@ ously until rec@@ ently .
Car@@ l S@@ ag@@ an always said , &quot; It takes extraordin@@ ary evi@@ den@@ ce for extraordin@@ ary cla@@ im@@ s . &quot;
And the cla@@ im@@ s of having life be@@ y@@ on@@ d Earth need to be defini@@ tive , they need to be l@@ ou@@ d and they need to be every@@ where for us to be able to believe it .
So how do we make this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y ?
What we decided to do is first look for those ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents for life .
The ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents of life are : li@@ qui@@ d water — we have to have a sol@@ v@@ ent , can &apos;t be ice , has to be li@@ qui@@ d .
We also have to have energy .
We also have to have organi@@ c material — things that make us up , but also things that we need to consu@@ me .
So we have to have these ele@@ ments in environ@@ ments for long peri@@ o@@ ds of time for us to be able to be confi@@ d@@ ent that life , in that moment when it star@@ ts , can s@@ par@@ k and then grow and e@@ vol@@ ve .
Well , I have to tell you that early in my car@@ e@@ er , when we looked at those three ele@@ ments , I didn &apos;t believe that they were be@@ y@@ on@@ d Earth in any l@@ eng@@ th of time and for any real qu@@ anti@@ ty .
Why ? We look at the in@@ ner plane@@ ts .
V@@ en@@ us is way too ho@@ t — it &apos;s got no water .
Mar@@ s — dr@@ y and ari@@ d .
It &apos;s got no water .
And be@@ y@@ on@@ d Mar@@ s , the water in the solar system is all fro@@ z@@ en .
But rec@@ ent obser@@ va@@ tions have chan@@ ged all that .
It &apos;s now tur@@ ning our attention to the right places for us to take a de@@ e@@ per look and really start to answer our life question .
So when we look out into the solar system , where are the pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ties ?
We &apos;re con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ting our attention on four lo@@ ca@@ tions .
The plan@@ et Mar@@ s and then three mo@@ ons of the ou@@ ter plane@@ ts : Ti@@ tan , Europa and small En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us .
So what about Mar@@ s ?
Let &apos;s go through the evi@@ den@@ ce .
Well , Mar@@ s we thought was ini@@ ti@@ ally mo@@ on-@@ like : full of cra@@ ters , ari@@ d and a de@@ ad world .
And so about 15 years ago , we started a seri@@ es of mis@@ si@@ ons to go to Mar@@ s and see if water exis@@ ted on Mar@@ s in its pa@@ st that chan@@ ged its ge@@ o@@ logy .
We ou@@ ght to be able to no@@ tice that .
And in@@ de@@ ed we started to be sur@@ pri@@ sed right away .
Ou@@ r high@@ er res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion imag@@ es show de@@ l@@ tas and ri@@ ver val@@ le@@ ys and g@@ ul@@ le@@ ys that were there in the pa@@ st .
And in fact , C@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ si@@ ty — which has been ro@@ ving on the sur@@ face now for about three years — has really sho@@ wn us that it &apos;s si@@ tting in an an@@ ci@@ ent ri@@ ver bed , where water f@@ low@@ ed ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly .
And not for a little while , per@@ haps hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of years .
And if everything was there , inclu@@ ding org@@ an@@ ic@@ s , per@@ haps life had started .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ si@@ ty has also dri@@ l@@ led in that red so@@ il and b@@ rou@@ ght up other material .
And we were really exci@@ ted when we saw that .
Because it was@@ n &apos;t red Mar@@ s , it was gra@@ y material , it &apos;s gra@@ y Mar@@ s .
We b@@ rou@@ ght it into the ro@@ ver , we tas@@ ted it , and gu@@ ess what ?
We tas@@ ted org@@ an@@ ic@@ s — car@@ b@@ on , hy@@ dro@@ gen , o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen , p@@ ho@@ s@@ ph@@ or@@ us , sul@@ fu@@ r — they were all there .
So Mar@@ s in its pa@@ st , with a lot of water , per@@ haps pl@@ ent@@ y of time , could have had life , could have had that s@@ par@@ k , could have gro@@ wn .
And is that life still there ?
We don &apos;t know that .
But a few years ago we started to look at a number of cra@@ ters .
D@@ ur@@ ing the su@@ mm@@ er , dar@@ k lin@@ es would ap@@ pe@@ ar down the si@@ des of these cra@@ ters .
The more we looked , the more cra@@ ters we saw , the more of these fe@@ atur@@ es .
We now know more than a do@@ z@@ en of them .
A few months ago the fa@@ ir@@ y tal@@ e came true .
We an@@ no@@ un@@ ced to the world that we know what these stre@@ a@@ ks are .
It &apos;s li@@ qui@@ d water .
These cra@@ ters are wee@@ ping dur@@ ing the su@@ mm@@ er .
Li@@ qui@@ d water is flo@@ wing down these cra@@ ters .
So what are we going to do now — now that we see the water ?
Well , it te@@ lls us that Mar@@ s has all the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents neces@@ s@@ ary for life .
In its pa@@ st it had per@@ haps tw@@ o@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of its nor@@ ther@@ n he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere — there was an ocean .
It has wee@@ ping water right now .
Li@@ qui@@ d water on its sur@@ face .
It has org@@ an@@ ic@@ s .
It has all the right condi@@ tions .
So what are we going to do next ?
We &apos;re going to la@@ un@@ ch a seri@@ es of mis@@ si@@ ons to beg@@ in that se@@ ar@@ ch for life on Mar@@ s .
And now it &apos;s more ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing than ever before .
As we move out into the solar system , here &apos;s the tin@@ y mo@@ on En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us .
This is not in what we call the tradi@@ tional ha@@ bi@@ table z@@ one , this are@@ a around the s@@ un .
This is much f@@ ur@@ ther out .
This ob@@ ject should be ice over a si@@ li@@ cate co@@ re .
But what did we find ?
C@@ as@@ sin@@ i was there sin@@ ce 200@@ 6 , and after a cou@@ ple years looked back after it f@@ le@@ w by En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us and sur@@ pri@@ sed us all .
En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us is b@@ la@@ st@@ ing s@@ he@@ e@@ ts of water out into the solar system and s@@ lo@@ sh@@ ing back down on@@ to the mo@@ on .
What a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous environment .
C@@ as@@ sin@@ i just a few months ago also f@@ le@@ w through the p@@ lu@@ me , and it meas@@ u@@ red si@@ li@@ cate partic@@ les .
Wh@@ ere does the si@@ li@@ ca come from ?
It must come from the ocean flo@@ or .
The ti@@ da@@ l energy is gener@@ ated by S@@ atur@@ n , pul@@ ling and s@@ que@@ e@@ zing this mo@@ on — is mel@@ ting that ice , cre@@ ating an ocean .
But it &apos;s also doing that to the co@@ re .
Now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an anal@@ o@@ gy ...
are hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents .
H@@ y@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents de@@ ep in our ocean were disco@@ vered in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
O@@ ce@@ an@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ers were comple@@ tely sur@@ pri@@ sed .
And now there are thousands of these be@@ low the ocean .
What do we find ?
The oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ers , when they go and look at these hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents , they &apos;re te@@ em@@ ing with life , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether the water is a@@ ci@@ di@@ c or al@@ k@@ al@@ ine — doesn &apos;t matter .
So hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents are a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous ab@@ o@@ de for life here on Earth .
So what about En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us ?
Well , we believe because it has water and has had it for a signifi@@ can@@ t peri@@ od of time , and we believe it has hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents with per@@ haps the right organi@@ c material , it is a place where life could exis@@ t .
And not just micro@@ bi@@ al — maybe more comple@@ x because it &apos;s had time to e@@ vol@@ ve .
A@@ no@@ ther mo@@ on , very similar , is Europa .
G@@ ali@@ leo visi@@ ted J@@ u@@ pi@@ ter &apos;s system in 19@@ 9@@ 6 and made f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous obser@@ va@@ tions of Europa .
Europa , we also know , has an under@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ ice cr@@ ust ocean .
G@@ ali@@ leo mis@@ sion told us that , but we never saw any p@@ lu@@ mes .
But we didn &apos;t look for them .
H@@ u@@ b@@ ble , just a cou@@ ple years ago , obser@@ ving Europa , saw p@@ lu@@ mes of water sp@@ ra@@ ying from the cra@@ c@@ ks in the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , just exactly like En@@ ce@@ la@@ d@@ us .
These mo@@ ons , which are not in what we call a tradi@@ tional ha@@ bi@@ table z@@ one , that are out in the solar system , have li@@ qui@@ d water .
And if there are org@@ an@@ ic@@ s there , there may be life .
This is a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous set of disco@@ ver@@ ies because these mo@@ ons have been in this environment like that for bi@@ llions of years .
Li@@ fe started here on Earth , we believe , after about the first 5@@ 00 million , and look where we are .
These mo@@ ons are f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous mo@@ ons .
A@@ no@@ ther mo@@ on that we &apos;re looking at is Ti@@ tan .
Ti@@ tan is a hu@@ ge mo@@ on of S@@ atur@@ n .
It per@@ haps is much lar@@ ger than the plan@@ et M@@ er@@ cur@@ y .
It has an ex@@ ten@@ sive at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere .
It &apos;s so ex@@ ten@@ sive — and it &apos;s most@@ ly n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen with a little me@@ th@@ an@@ e and e@@ th@@ an@@ e — that you have to pe@@ er through it with ra@@ dar .
And on the sur@@ face , C@@ as@@ sin@@ i has found li@@ qui@@ d .
We see la@@ kes ...
actually almost the size of our B@@ lack Se@@ a in some places .
And this are@@ a is not li@@ qui@@ d water ; it &apos;s me@@ th@@ an@@ e .
If there &apos;s any place in the solar system where life is not like us , where the sub@@ stitu@@ te of water is another sol@@ v@@ ent — and it could be me@@ th@@ an@@ e — it could be Ti@@ tan .
Well , is there life be@@ y@@ on@@ d Earth in the solar system ?
We don &apos;t know yet , but we &apos;re ho@@ t on the pur@@ su@@ it .
The data that we &apos;re rece@@ i@@ ving is really exci@@ ting and telling us — for@@ c@@ ing us to think about this in new and exci@@ ting ways .
I believe we &apos;re on the right tra@@ ck .
That in the next 10 years , we will answer that question .
And if we answer it , and it &apos;s posi@@ tive , then life is every@@ where in the solar system .
J@@ ust think about that .
We may not be al@@ one .
Thank you .

M@@ any believe dri@@ ving is an activi@@ ty so@@ le@@ ly res@@ er@@ ved for those who can see .
A b@@ lin@@ d person dri@@ ving a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le sa@@ fe@@ ly and in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently was thought to be an im@@ possible tas@@ k , until now .
H@@ el@@ lo , my name is D@@ en@@ n@@ is H@@ ong , and we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing f@@ ree@@ dom and in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce to the b@@ lin@@ d by buil@@ ding a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le for the visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
So before I talk about this car for the b@@ lin@@ d , let me bri@@ ef@@ ly tell you about another project that I worked on called the D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A U@@ r@@ ban Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge .
Now this was about buil@@ ding a ro@@ bo@@ tic car that can dri@@ ve it@@ self .
You pres@@ s start , no@@ body tou@@ ches anything , and it can re@@ ach its dest@@ in@@ ation ful@@ ly au@@ ton@@ o@@ m@@ ously .
So in 200@@ 7 , our te@@ am w@@ on half a million dollars by pl@@ ac@@ ing th@@ ird place in this com@@ peti@@ tion .
So about that time , the Na@@ tional F@@ e@@ der@@ ation of the B@@ lin@@ d , or N@@ F@@ B , ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ed the research com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e about who can develo@@ p a car that le@@ ts a b@@ lin@@ d person dri@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ly and in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently .
We decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , how hard could it be ? &quot; &quot; We have already an au@@ ton@@ o@@ mous ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
We just put a b@@ lin@@ d person in it and we &apos;re done , right ?
( Laughter ) We coul@@ dn &apos;t have been more wrong .
What N@@ F@@ B wanted was not a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le that can dri@@ ve a b@@ lin@@ d person around , but a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le where a b@@ lin@@ d person can make ac@@ tive deci@@ si@@ ons and dri@@ ve .
So we had to th@@ row everything out the win@@ do@@ w and start from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch .
So to test this cra@@ z@@ y idea , we developed a small d@@ un@@ e bu@@ g@@ gy pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le to test the fe@@ asi@@ bility .
And in the su@@ mm@@ er of 200@@ 9 , we invi@@ ted do@@ z@@ ens of b@@ lin@@ d y@@ outh from all over the country and ga@@ ve them a chan@@ ce to take it for a sp@@ in .
It was an absolu@@ tely amazing experience .
But the problem with this car was it was desig@@ ned to only be dri@@ ven in a very contro@@ l@@ led environment , in a fl@@ at , clo@@ se@@ d-@@ off par@@ king lot — even the lan@@ es defin@@ ed by red tra@@ f@@ fic con@@ es .
So with this suc@@ cess , we decided to take the next big ste@@ p , to develo@@ p a real car that can be dri@@ ven on real ro@@ ads .
So how does it work ?
Well , it &apos;s a ra@@ ther comple@@ x system , but let me try to ex@@ pla@@ in it , maybe simp@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
So we have three ste@@ ps .
We have per@@ cep@@ tion , compu@@ tation and n@@ on-@@ visual inter@@ fac@@ es .
Now obvi@@ ously the dri@@ ver cannot see , so the system nee@@ ds to per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve the environment and ga@@ ther information for the dri@@ ver .
For that , we use an ini@@ ti@@ al meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment un@@ it .
So it meas@@ ur@@ es ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation , an@@ gu@@ lar ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation — like a human e@@ ar , in@@ ner e@@ ar .
We f@@ use that information with a G@@ P@@ S un@@ it to get an esti@@ mate of the lo@@ cation of the car .
We also use two ca@@ mer@@ as to detec@@ t the lan@@ es of the ro@@ ad .
And we also use three la@@ ser ran@@ ge fin@@ ders .
The la@@ ser@@ s s@@ can the environment to detec@@ t ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les — a car appro@@ ach@@ ing from the front , the back and also any ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les that r@@ un into the ro@@ ads , any ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les around the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
So all this v@@ ast amount of information is then f@@ ed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
One is , first of all , process this information to have an underst@@ an@@ ding of the environment — these are the lan@@ es of the ro@@ ad , there &apos;s the ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les — and con@@ ve@@ y this information to the dri@@ ver .
The system is also s@@ mar@@ t enough to figur@@ e out the sa@@ f@@ est way to oper@@ ate the car .
So we can also gener@@ ate in@@ struc@@ tions on how to oper@@ ate the contro@@ ls of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
But the problem is this : How do we con@@ ve@@ y this information and in@@ struc@@ tions to a person who cannot see f@@ ast enough and ac@@ cu@@ rate enough so he can dri@@ ve ?
So for this , we developed many different ty@@ pes of n@@ on-@@ visual us@@ er inter@@ face technology .
So star@@ ting from a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al ping sound system , a vi@@ bra@@ ting v@@ est , a cli@@ ck whe@@ el with vo@@ ice com@@ man@@ ds , a le@@ g stri@@ p , even a sho@@ e that ap@@ pli@@ es pres@@ sure to the fo@@ o@@ t .
But today we &apos;re going to talk about three of these n@@ on-@@ visual us@@ er inter@@ fac@@ es .
Now the first inter@@ face is called a D@@ ri@@ ve@@ G@@ ri@@ p .
So these are a pa@@ ir of glo@@ ves , and it has vi@@ bra@@ ting ele@@ ments on the k@@ nuc@@ k@@ le part so you can con@@ ve@@ y in@@ struc@@ tions about how to ste@@ er — the direc@@ tion and the inten@@ si@@ ty .
A@@ no@@ ther devi@@ ce is called S@@ pe@@ e@@ d@@ S@@ tri@@ p .
So this is a cha@@ ir — as a matter of fact , it &apos;s actually a mas@@ sa@@ ge cha@@ ir .
We gu@@ t it out , and we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the vi@@ bra@@ ting ele@@ ments in different pa@@ tter@@ ns , and we actu@@ ate them to con@@ ve@@ y information about the spe@@ ed , and also in@@ struc@@ tions how to use the gas and the bra@@ ke pe@@ da@@ l .
So over here , you can see how the computer underst@@ an@@ ds the environment , and because you cannot see the vi@@ bra@@ tion , we actually put red L@@ E@@ D &apos;s on the dri@@ ver so that you can see what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
This is the sen@@ s@@ ory data , and that data is trans@@ fer@@ red to the devi@@ ces through the computer .
So these two devi@@ ces , D@@ ri@@ ve@@ G@@ ri@@ p and S@@ pe@@ e@@ d@@ S@@ tri@@ p , are very effec@@ tive .
But the problem is these are in@@ struc@@ tional cu@@ e devi@@ ces .
So this is not really f@@ ree@@ dom , right ?
The computer te@@ lls you how to dri@@ ve — turn left , turn right , spe@@ ed up , stop .
We call this the &quot; &quot; bac@@ k@@ se@@ at@@ -@@ dri@@ ver problem . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re mo@@ ving away from the in@@ struc@@ tional cu@@ e devi@@ ces , and we &apos;re now fo@@ c@@ using more on the informa@@ tional devi@@ ces .
A good example for this informa@@ tional n@@ on-@@ visual us@@ er inter@@ face is called A@@ ir@@ P@@ i@@ x .
So think of it as a mon@@ it@@ or for the b@@ lin@@ d .
So it &apos;s a small ta@@ b@@ let , has many h@@ ol@@ es in it , and com@@ pres@@ sed air comes out , so it can actually dra@@ w imag@@ es .
So even though you are b@@ lin@@ d , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lan@@ es of the ro@@ ad and ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , you can also change the f@@ re@@ quen@@ cy of the air coming out and pos@@ si@@ bly the tem@@ per@@ ature .
So it &apos;s actually a multi@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al us@@ er inter@@ face .
So here you can see the left cam@@ era , the right cam@@ era from the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le and how the computer inter@@ pre@@ ts that and sen@@ ds that information to the A@@ ir@@ P@@ i@@ x .
For this , we &apos;re sho@@ wing a si@@ mu@@ la@@ tor , a b@@ lin@@ d person dri@@ ving using the A@@ ir@@ P@@ i@@ x .
This si@@ mu@@ la@@ tor was also very u@@ se@@ ful for tra@@ in@@ ing the b@@ lin@@ d dri@@ ver@@ s and also qu@@ ick@@ ly t@@ esting different ty@@ pes of ideas for different ty@@ pes of n@@ on-@@ visual us@@ er inter@@ fac@@ es .
So basi@@ cally that &apos;s how it works .
So just a mon@@ th ago , on J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 2@@ 9@@ th , we un@@ ve@@ i@@ led this ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le for the very first time to the publi@@ c at the wor@@ l@@ d-@@ fa@@ mous D@@ a@@ y@@ ton@@ a Inter@@ national S@@ pe@@ e@@ d@@ way dur@@ ing the R@@ o@@ le@@ x 2@@ 4 rac@@ ing ev@@ ent .
We also had some sur@@ pri@@ ses . Let &apos;s take a look .
( Music ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) An@@ no@@ un@@ cer : This is an histori@@ c day in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
He &apos;s coming up to the gran@@ d@@ st@@ and , fel@@ low F@@ e@@ der@@ a@@ tion@@ ist@@ s .
( C@@ he@@ er@@ ing ) ( H@@ on@@ king ) There &apos;s the gran@@ d@@ st@@ and now .
And he &apos;s &#91; un@@ c@@ lear &#93; fol@@ lo@@ wing that van that &apos;s out in front of him .
Well there comes the first bo@@ x .
Now let &apos;s see if Mar@@ k a@@ vo@@ i@@ ds it .
He does . He pas@@ ses it on the right .
Th@@ ird bo@@ x is out . The f@@ our@@ th bo@@ x is out .
And he &apos;s perfec@@ tly making his way between the two .
He &apos;s clo@@ sing in on the van to make the mo@@ ving pas@@ s .
Well this is what it &apos;s all about , this kind of dy@@ na@@ mic dis@@ play of au@@ da@@ city and ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
He &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ing the end of the r@@ un , makes his way between the bar@@ re@@ ls that are set up there .
( H@@ on@@ king ) ( Applause ) D@@ en@@ n@@ is H@@ ong : I &apos;m so happ@@ y for you .
Mar@@ k &apos;s going to give me a ri@@ de back to the ho@@ te@@ l .
Mar@@ k R@@ ic@@ co@@ bon@@ o : Y@@ es .
( Applause ) D@@ H : So sin@@ ce we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundre@@ ds of le@@ t@@ ters , e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , ph@@ one cal@@ ls from people from all around the world .
Le@@ t@@ ters th@@ an@@ king us , but sometimes you also get fun@@ ny le@@ t@@ ters like this one : &quot; Now I understand why there is B@@ ra@@ il@@ le on a dri@@ ve@@ -@@ up A@@ T@@ M mach@@ ine . &quot;
( Laughter ) But sometimes — ( Laughter ) But sometimes I also do get — I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t call it ha@@ te mai@@ l — but le@@ t@@ ters of really st@@ rong con@@ cer@@ n : &quot; &quot; D@@ r. H@@ ong , are you in@@ san@@ e , trying to put b@@ lin@@ d people on the ro@@ ad ?
You must be out of your mind . &quot; &quot; But this ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le is a pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , and it &apos;s not going to be on the ro@@ ad until it &apos;s pro@@ ven as sa@@ fe as , or sa@@ fer than , today &apos;s ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
And I tru@@ ly believe that this can happen .
But still , will the socie@@ ty , would they ac@@ cep@@ t such a radi@@ cal idea ?
How are we going to han@@ dle in@@ sur@@ ance ?
How are we going to is@@ su@@ e dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ ses ?
There &apos;s many of these different kinds of h@@ ur@@ d@@ les b@@ esi@@ des technology ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es that we need to ad@@ d@@ ress before this be@@ comes a re@@ ality .
O@@ f course , the ma@@ in go@@ al of this project is to develo@@ p a car for the b@@ lin@@ d .
But po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally more important than this is the tre@@ men@@ dous valu@@ e of the sp@@ in@@ -@@ off technology that can come from this project .
The sen@@ sor@@ s that are used can see through the dar@@ k , the fo@@ g and ra@@ in .
And together with this new ty@@ pe of inter@@ fac@@ es , we can use these technolo@@ gi@@ es and ap@@ p@@ ly them to sa@@ fer car@@ s for si@@ gh@@ ted people .
O@@ r for the b@@ lin@@ d , every@@ day home ap@@ pli@@ an@@ ces — in the edu@@ ca@@ tional se@@ tting , in the of@@ fi@@ ce se@@ tting .
J@@ ust imagine , in a cla@@ s@@ s@@ room a teach@@ er wri@@ tes on the b@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ bo@@ ard and a b@@ lin@@ d stud@@ ent can see what &apos;s wri@@ t@@ ten and read using these n@@ on-@@ visual inter@@ fac@@ es .
This is pri@@ cel@@ ess .
So today , the things I &apos;ve sho@@ w@@ ed you today , is just the beg@@ in@@ ning .
Thank you very much .

So a cou@@ ple of years ago I started a progra@@ m to try to get the ro@@ c@@ k@@ s@@ tar te@@ ch and desig@@ n people to take a year off and work in the one environment that repres@@ ents pretty much everything they &apos;re sup@@ pos@@ ed to ha@@ te ; we have them work in government .
The progra@@ m is called Co@@ de for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Pe@@ ace C@@ or@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
We se@@ lec@@ t a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city govern@@ ments .
In@@ stead of sen@@ ding them off into the Th@@ ird W@@ or@@ ld , we sen@@ d them into the w@@ il@@ ds of C@@ ity H@@ all .
And there they make great ap@@ ps , they work with city sta@@ f@@ fer@@ s .
But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re sho@@ wing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
So me@@ et A@@ l .
A@@ l is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Bo@@ st@@ on .
Here it kind of loo@@ ks like he &apos;s looking for a da@@ te , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ w@@ ed in , because he kno@@ ws he &apos;s not very good at fi@@ gh@@ ting fir@@ es when he &apos;s co@@ vered in four fe@@ et of s@@ now .
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very uni@@ que man@@ ner ?
We had a te@@ am of fel@@ lo@@ ws in Bo@@ st@@ on last year through the Co@@ de for America progra@@ m .
They were there in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ w@@ ed a lot in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary last year .
And they no@@ tic@@ ed that the city never gets to di@@ gg@@ ing out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts .
But one fel@@ low in particular , a guy na@@ med E@@ ri@@ k M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el@@ s@@ -@@ O@@ b@@ er , no@@ tic@@ ed something else , and that &apos;s that ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
So he did what any good develo@@ per would do , he w@@ r@@ ote an ap@@ p .
It &apos;s a cu@@ te little ap@@ p where you can ado@@ pt a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
So you ag@@ ree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one A@@ l .
And if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
So it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs on it .
This is a mo@@ des@@ t little ap@@ p .
It &apos;s probably the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est of the 2@@ 1 ap@@ ps that the fel@@ lo@@ ws w@@ r@@ ote last year .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing vir@@ ally .
There &apos;s a guy in the I@@ .@@ T@@ . de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of the C@@ ity of H@@ on@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realiz@@ ed that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to ado@@ pt t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i si@@ ren@@ s .
It &apos;s very important that these t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i si@@ ren@@ s work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ teri@@ es out of them .
So he &apos;s getting ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to ch@@ ec@@ k on them .
And then Se@@ at@@ t@@ le decided to use it to get ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to c@@ lear out clo@@ gg@@ ed stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
And C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go just ro@@ l@@ led it out to get people to si@@ g@@ n up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
So we now know of n@@ ine ci@@ ties that are plan@@ ning to use this .
And this has s@@ pre@@ ad just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly , org@@ an@@ ic@@ ally , n@@ atur@@ ally .
If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it nor@@ m@@ ally goes .
Pro@@ cur@@ ing sof@@ tw@@ are us@@ u@@ ally takes a cou@@ ple of years .
We had a te@@ am that worked on a project in Bo@@ st@@ on last year that took three people about two and a half months .
It was a way that parents could figur@@ e out which were the right publi@@ c s@@ cho@@ ols for their kids .
We were told af@@ ter@@ ward that if that had g@@ one through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have ta@@ ken at le@@ ast two years and it would have co@@ st about two million dollars .
And that &apos;s nothing .
There is one project in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a cour@@ t system right now that so far co@@ st ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are pro@@ jects like this at every level of government .
So an ap@@ p that takes a cou@@ ple of days to wri@@ te and then s@@ pre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a sho@@ t across the bo@@ w to the institu@@ tion of government .
It su@@ gg@@ est@@ s how government could work better — not more like a priva@@ te comp@@ any , as many people think it should .
And not even like a te@@ ch comp@@ any , but more like the Internet it@@ self .
And that means permi@@ s@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ a@@ tive .
And that &apos;s important .
But what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it repres@@ ents how a new gener@@ ation is tac@@ k@@ ling the problem of government — not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fi@@ ed institu@@ tion , but as a problem of col@@ lec@@ tive ac@@ tion .
And that &apos;s great news , because , it tur@@ ns out , we &apos;re very good at col@@ lec@@ tive ac@@ tion with di@@ gi@@ tal technology .
Now there &apos;s a very lar@@ ge commun@@ ity of people that are buil@@ ding the to@@ ols that we need to do things together effec@@ tively .
It &apos;s not just Co@@ de for America fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundre@@ ds of people all over the country that are stan@@ ding and wri@@ ting ci@@ vi@@ c ap@@ ps every day in their own communi@@ ties .
They ha@@ ven &apos;t given up on government .
They are f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted as h@@ ell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
And these fol@@ ks know something that we &apos;ve lost si@@ ght of .
And that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your fe@@ el@@ ings about poli@@ tics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really ma@@ d about , government is , at its co@@ re , in the words of Ti@@ m O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do al@@ one . &quot;
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consi@@ der , because things are chan@@ ging .
Po@@ li@@ tics is not chan@@ ging ; government is chan@@ ging .
And because government ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely der@@ i@@ ves its power from us — remember &quot; &quot; We the people ? &quot; &quot; — how we think about it is going to effec@@ t how that change happens .
Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this progra@@ m .
And like a lot of people , I thought government was basi@@ cally about getting people elec@@ ted to of@@ fi@@ ce .
Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion that , especi@@ ally lo@@ cal government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
This is the call cen@@ ter for the ser@@ vi@@ ces and information line .
It &apos;s gener@@ ally where you will get if you call 3@@ 1@@ 1 in your city .
If you should ever have the chan@@ ce to sta@@ ff your city &apos;s call cen@@ ter , as our fel@@ low S@@ co@@ t@@ t S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the progra@@ m — in fact , they all do that — you will find that people call government with a very wi@@ de ran@@ ge of is@@ su@@ es , inclu@@ ding having an o@@ pos@@ su@@ m st@@ uc@@ k in your house .
So S@@ co@@ t@@ t gets this call .
He ty@@ pes &quot; &quot; O@@ pos@@ su@@ m &quot; &quot; into this of@@ fici@@ al kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge base .
He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He star@@ ts with animal control .
And finally , he says , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ ou@@ d and see if the thing lea@@ ves ? &quot; &quot; So that worked . So bo@@ o@@ y@@ a for S@@ co@@ t@@ t .
But that was@@ n &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
Bo@@ st@@ on doesn &apos;t just have a call cen@@ ter .
It has an ap@@ p , a W@@ e@@ b and mo@@ bi@@ le ap@@ p , called C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens Con@@ nec@@ t .
Now we didn &apos;t wri@@ te this ap@@ p .
This is the work of the very s@@ mar@@ t people at the O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce of Ne@@ w U@@ r@@ ban M@@ e@@ chan@@ ic@@ s in Bo@@ st@@ on .
So one day — this is an actual re@@ port — this came in : &quot; &quot; O@@ pos@@ su@@ m in my tra@@ sh@@ can . C@@ an &apos;t tell if it &apos;s de@@ ad .
How do I get this re@@ mo@@ ved ? &quot; &quot; But what happens with C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens Con@@ nec@@ t is different .
So S@@ co@@ t@@ t was spe@@ a@@ king person@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ person .
But on C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens Con@@ nec@@ t everything is publi@@ c , so every@@ body can see this .
And in this case , a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or saw it .
And the next re@@ port we got said , &quot; &quot; I wal@@ ked over to this lo@@ cation , found the tra@@ sh@@ can be@@ hind the house .
O@@ pos@@ su@@ m ? Ch@@ ec@@ k . Li@@ ving ? Y@@ ep .
Tur@@ ned tra@@ sh@@ can on its side . W@@ al@@ ked home .
Goo@@ d@@ ni@@ ght s@@ we@@ et o@@ pos@@ su@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Pre@@ tty simple .
So this is great . This is the di@@ gi@@ tal me@@ e@@ ting the physical .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the cro@@ w@@ d-@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing game .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a pla@@ t@@ form .
And I don &apos;t mean neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly a technolo@@ gi@@ cal defini@@ tion of pla@@ t@@ form here .
I &apos;m just talking about a pla@@ t@@ form for people to help themselves and to help others .
So one ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en hel@@ ped another ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en , but government play@@ ed a k@@ ey ro@@ le here .
It connec@@ ted those two people .
And it could have connec@@ ted them with government ser@@ vi@@ ces if they &apos;d been nee@@ ded , but a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or is a far better and che@@ ap@@ er alter@@ na@@ tive to government ser@@ vi@@ ces .
When one ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or hel@@ ps another , we str@@ eng@@ then our communi@@ ties .
We call animal control , it just co@@ sts a lot of money .
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as poli@@ tics .
And most people get that , but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other .
That our in@@ put to the system of government is v@@ ot@@ ing .
Now how many times have we elec@@ ted a poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ er — and sometimes we s@@ pen@@ d a lot of energy getting a new poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ er elec@@ ted — and then we si@@ t back and we expec@@ t government to ref@@ lec@@ t our valu@@ es and me@@ et our nee@@ ds , and then not that much chan@@ ges ?
That &apos;s because government is like a v@@ ast ocean and poli@@ tics is the si@@ x@@ -@@ in@@ ch la@@ y@@ er on top .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
And we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
But it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that ke@@ e@@ ps this thing that we own and we pa@@ y for as something that &apos;s working aga@@ in@@ st us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dise@@ m@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
People see@@ m to think poli@@ tics is sex@@ y .
If we want this institu@@ tion to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to eng@@ age with the mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of government .
So that &apos;s O@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ y@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C mo@@ ve@@ ment has done .
Ha@@ ve you seen these gu@@ ys ?
It &apos;s a gro@@ up of con@@ cer@@ ned ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens that have wri@@ t@@ ten a very de@@ ta@@ i@@ led 3@@ 2@@ 5@@ -@@ pa@@ ge re@@ port that &apos;s a respon@@ se to the S@@ E@@ C &apos;s re@@ qu@@ est for com@@ ment on the Fin@@ an@@ cial Re@@ form B@@ ill .
That &apos;s not being poli@@ tically ac@@ tive , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically ac@@ tive .
Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to lea@@ ve for our children .
You have to see the enor@@ mous ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es that they &apos;re going to face .
D@@ o we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institu@@ tion that can ac@@ t on be@@ half of all of us ?
We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effec@@ tive .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to funda@@ ment@@ ally re@@ fra@@ me the func@@ tion of government in a way that can actually s@@ cal@@ e by str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing ci@@ vi@@ l socie@@ ty .
And there &apos;s a gener@@ ation out there that &apos;s gro@@ wn up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ t the syste@@ ms the right way .
Now the a@@ ver@@ age age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 2@@ 8 , so I am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ing@@ ly , almost a gener@@ ation ol@@ der than most of them .
This is a gener@@ ation that &apos;s gro@@ wn up taking their vo@@ ic@@ es pretty much for gran@@ ted .
They &apos;re not fi@@ gh@@ ting that bat@@ t@@ le that we &apos;re all fi@@ gh@@ ting about who gets to spe@@ ak ; they all get to spe@@ ak .
They can expres@@ s their op@@ ini@@ on on any chan@@ ne@@ l at any time , and they do .
So when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their vo@@ ic@@ es .
They &apos;re using their han@@ ds . They &apos;re using their han@@ ds
to wri@@ te ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions that make government work better .
And those ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions let us use our han@@ ds to make our communi@@ ties better .
That could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , tur@@ ning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an o@@ pos@@ su@@ m in it .
And cer@@ tain@@ ly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all al@@ ong , and many people do .
But these ap@@ ps are like little di@@ gi@@ tal re@@ min@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consu@@ m@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consu@@ m@@ ers of government , pu@@ tting in our ta@@ xes and getting back ser@@ vi@@ ces .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
And we &apos;re not going to fi@@ x government until we fi@@ x ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship .
So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a cro@@ w@@ d of vo@@ ic@@ es , or are we also going to be a cro@@ w@@ d of han@@ ds ?
Thank you .

Now , if P@@ res@@ id@@ ent O@@ ba@@ ma invi@@ ted me to be the next C@@ zar of Ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , then I would have a su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion for him that I think would va@@ st@@ ly impro@@ ve the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics education in this country .
And it would be e@@ as@@ y to imp@@ le@@ ment and in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive .
The ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um that we have is based on a fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic and al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
And everything we learn after that is buil@@ ding up to@@ war@@ ds one sub@@ ject .
And at top of that p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , it &apos;s cal@@ cul@@ us .
And I &apos;m here to say that I think that that is the wrong su@@ m@@ mi@@ t of the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d ...
that the correc@@ t su@@ m@@ mi@@ t — that all of our stud@@ ents , every high school gra@@ du@@ ate should know — should be sta@@ ti@@ stics : probab@@ ili@@ ty and sta@@ ti@@ stics .
( Applause ) I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . C@@ al@@ cul@@ us is an important sub@@ ject .
It &apos;s one of the great produc@@ ts of the human mind .
The la@@ ws of n@@ ature are wri@@ t@@ ten in the language of cal@@ cul@@ us .
And every stud@@ ent who stu@@ dies ma@@ th , science , eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing , econo@@ mi@@ cs , they should defini@@ tely learn cal@@ cul@@ us by the end of their f@@ res@@ h@@ man year of colle@@ ge .
But I &apos;m here to say , as a profes@@ s@@ or of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , that very few people actually use cal@@ cul@@ us in a consci@@ ous , me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful way , in their da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day lives .
O@@ n the other hand , sta@@ ti@@ stics — that &apos;s a sub@@ ject that you could , and should , use on da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is . R@@ ight ?
It &apos;s ris@@ k . It &apos;s re@@ ward . It &apos;s ran@@ do@@ m@@ ness .
It &apos;s underst@@ an@@ ding data .
I think if our stud@@ ents , if our high school stud@@ ents — if all of the Ameri@@ can ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens — knew about probab@@ ili@@ ty and sta@@ ti@@ stics , we w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be in the econo@@ mic mes@@ s that we &apos;re in today . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) No@@ t only — th@@ ank you — not only that ...
but if it &apos;s ta@@ u@@ ght pro@@ per@@ ly , it can be a lot of f@@ un .
I mean , probab@@ ili@@ ty and sta@@ ti@@ stics , it &apos;s the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of games and ga@@ mb@@ ling .
It &apos;s anal@@ y@@ zing tr@@ ends . It &apos;s pre@@ dic@@ ting the future .
L@@ oo@@ k , the world has chan@@ ged from anal@@ o@@ g to di@@ gi@@ tal .
And it &apos;s time for our ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um to change from anal@@ o@@ g to di@@ gi@@ tal , from the more cla@@ s@@ si@@ cal , continu@@ ous ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , to the more moder@@ n , dis@@ cre@@ te ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics — the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty , of ran@@ do@@ m@@ ness , of data — that being probab@@ ili@@ ty and sta@@ ti@@ stics .
In su@@ m@@ mar@@ y , instead of our stud@@ ents learning about the tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es of cal@@ cul@@ us , I think it would be far more signifi@@ can@@ t if all of them knew what two stan@@ d@@ ard devi@@ ations from the mean means . And I mean it .
Thank you very much .

The doc@@ tor determin@@ es that you have high ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol and you would ben@@ ef@@ it from medi@@ cation to tre@@ at it .
So you get a pi@@ ll@@ bo@@ x .
You have some confi@@ den@@ ce , your physi@@ ci@@ an has some confi@@ den@@ ce that this is going to work .
The comp@@ any that in@@ ven@@ ted it did a lot of stu@@ dies , sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted it to the F@@ D@@ A .
They stu@@ died it very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , s@@ ke@@ p@@ tically , they appro@@ ved it .
They have a rou@@ gh idea of how it works , they have a rou@@ gh idea of what the side effec@@ ts are .
It should be O@@ K .
You have a little more of a conversa@@ tion with your physi@@ ci@@ an and the physi@@ ci@@ an is a little wor@@ ri@@ ed because you &apos;ve been blue , ha@@ ven &apos;t fel@@ t like yourself , you ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to en@@ jo@@ y things in life quite as much as you us@@ u@@ ally do .
Y@@ our physi@@ ci@@ an says , &quot; &quot; You know , I think you have some depres@@ sion .
I &apos;m going to have to give you another p@@ ill . &quot; &quot; So now we &apos;re talking about two medica@@ tions .
This p@@ ill also — mi@@ llions of people have ta@@ ken it , the comp@@ any did stu@@ dies , the F@@ D@@ A looked at it — all good .
after the drugs h@@ it the mar@@ ket .
Th@@ ree ? F@@ i@@ ve ? S@@ even ?
Why do I care about this problem ?
So let me tell you a data science story .
And it beg@@ ins with my stud@@ ent N@@ ick .
Let &apos;s call him &quot; &quot; N@@ ick , &quot; &quot; because that &apos;s his name .
( Laughter ) N@@ ick was a young stud@@ ent .
I said , &quot; &quot; You know , N@@ ick , we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separ@@ ately , and we don &apos;t have a great underst@@ an@@ ding .
They liter@@ ally put on the we@@ b — publi@@ c@@ ly a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble , you could all do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it right now — hundre@@ ds of thousands of ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ent re@@ por@@ ts from patients , doc@@ tors , comp@@ ani@@ es , ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ci@@ sts .
And these re@@ por@@ ts are pretty simple : it has all the dise@@ ases that the pati@@ ent has , all the drugs that they &apos;re on , and all the ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ents , or side effec@@ ts , that they experience .
It is not all of the ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ents that are oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in America today , but it &apos;s hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of thousands of drugs .
So I said to N@@ ick , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s think about g@@ lu@@ co@@ se .
G@@ lu@@ co@@ se is very important , and we know it &apos;s invol@@ ved with diabe@@ tes .
Let &apos;s see if we can understand g@@ lu@@ co@@ se respon@@ se .
I s@@ ent N@@ ick off . N@@ ick came back .
&quot; &quot; R@@ us@@ s , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve cre@@ ated a cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ er that can look at the side effec@@ ts of a drug based on looking at this da@@ ta@@ base , and can tell you whether that drug is li@@ ke@@ ly to change g@@ lu@@ co@@ se or not . &quot; &quot; He did it . It was very simple , in a way .
He took all the drugs that were kno@@ wn to change g@@ lu@@ co@@ se and a bun@@ ch of drugs that don &apos;t change g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , and said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the differ@@ ence in their side effec@@ ts ?
D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ences in fa@@ ti@@ gue ? In ap@@ peti@@ te ? In ur@@ in@@ ation hab@@ its ? &quot; &quot; All those things con@@ spi@@ red to give him a really good pre@@ dic@@ tor .
&quot; &quot; But N@@ ick , there &apos;s a problem .
It &apos;s that every physi@@ ci@@ an in the world kno@@ ws all the drugs that change g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , because it &apos;s co@@ re to our prac@@ tice .
&quot; &quot; I thought you might say that , so I did one other experi@@ ment .
I looked at people in this da@@ ta@@ base who were on two drugs , and I looked for si@@ gn@@ als similar , g@@ lu@@ co@@ se@@ -@@ chan@@ ging si@@ gn@@ als , for people taking two drugs , where each drug al@@ one did not change g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , but together I saw a st@@ rong si@@ gn@@ al . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh ! You &apos;re c@@ le@@ ver . G@@ o@@ od idea . S@@ how me the li@@ st . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a bun@@ ch of drugs , not very exci@@ ting .
So that &apos;s a million people who might be having some problems with their g@@ lu@@ co@@ se if this mach@@ in@@ e@@ -@@ learning mu@@ mb@@ o j@@ u@@ mb@@ o that he did in the F@@ D@@ A da@@ ta@@ base actually h@@ ol@@ ds up .
We have a co@@ p@@ y of it that &apos;s O@@ K for research , we re@@ mo@@ ved identi@@ f@@ ying information .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s see if people on these two drugs have problems with their g@@ lu@@ co@@ se . &quot; &quot; Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the S@@ tan@@ for@@ d medical recor@@ ds that take par@@ o@@ xe@@ t@@ ine and pra@@ vas@@ ta@@ ti@@ n .
But we nee@@ ded spe@@ cial patients .
We nee@@ ded patients who were on one of them and had a g@@ lu@@ co@@ se meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment , then got the second one and had another g@@ lu@@ co@@ se meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment , all within a reas@@ on@@ able peri@@ od of time — something like two months .
And when we did that , we found 10 patients .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , ei@@ ght out of the 10 had a bu@@ m@@ p in their g@@ lu@@ co@@ se when they got the second P — we call this P and P — when they got the second P@@ .
E@@ i@@ ther one could be first , the second one comes up , g@@ lu@@ co@@ se went up 20 mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms per deci@@ li@@ ter .
And if it gets up to 1@@ 20 , 1@@ 25 , your doc@@ tor beg@@ ins to think about a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al diagno@@ sis of diabe@@ tes .
So a 20 bu@@ m@@ p — pretty signifi@@ can@@ t .
I said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ick , this is very co@@ ol .
And we said , let &apos;s call our fri@@ ends at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard and V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t , who also — H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard in Bo@@ st@@ on , V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t in N@@ as@@ h@@ vi@@ lle , who also have elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c medical recor@@ ds similar to our@@ s .
Let &apos;s see if they can find similar patients with the one P , the other P , the g@@ lu@@ co@@ se meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments in that ran@@ ge that we need .
God b@@ less them , V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t in one wee@@ k found 40 such patients , same tr@@ end .
H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard found 100 patients , same tr@@ end .
So at the end , we had 1@@ 50 patients from three diver@@ se medical cen@@ ters that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their g@@ lu@@ co@@ se bu@@ m@@ p some@@ what signifi@@ can@@ tly .
M@@ ore inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , we had left out diabe@@ tics , because diabe@@ tics already have mes@@ sed up g@@ lu@@ co@@ se .
When we looked at the g@@ lu@@ co@@ se of diabe@@ tics , it was going up 60 mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms per deci@@ li@@ ter , not just 20 .
This was a big de@@ al , and we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got to publi@@ sh this . &quot; &quot; We sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted the pa@@ per .
It was all data evi@@ den@@ ce , data from the F@@ D@@ A , data from S@@ tan@@ for@@ d , data from V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t , data from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard .
We had not done a single real experi@@ ment .
But we were ner@@ v@@ ous .
So N@@ ick , while the pa@@ per was in re@@ vie@@ w , went to the lab .
We found somebody who knew about lab stuff .
I don &apos;t do that .
I take care of patients , but I don &apos;t do pi@@ pe@@ t@@ tes .
They ta@@ u@@ ght us how to fe@@ ed mi@@ ce drugs .
We took mi@@ ce and we ga@@ ve them one P , par@@ o@@ xe@@ t@@ ine .
We ga@@ ve some other mi@@ ce pra@@ vas@@ ta@@ ti@@ n .
And we ga@@ ve a th@@ ird gro@@ up of mi@@ ce both of them .
And lo and be@@ h@@ old , g@@ lu@@ co@@ se went up 20 to 60 mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms per deci@@ li@@ ter in the mi@@ ce .
That was great , and the story could have en@@ ded there .
But I still have six and a half minu@@ tes .
They could and they should .
How would we ever determin@@ e that ? &quot; &quot; We said , well , what do you do ?
You &apos;re taking a medi@@ cation , one new medi@@ cation or two , and you get a fun@@ ny fe@@ el@@ ing .
You go to Goog@@ le and ty@@ pe in the two drugs you &apos;re taking or the one drug you &apos;re taking , and you ty@@ pe in &quot; &quot; side effec@@ ts . &quot; &quot; What are you experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing ?
Goog@@ le , I am sor@@ ry to say , den@@ i@@ ed our re@@ qu@@ est .
So I was bu@@ m@@ med .
I was at a din@@ ner with a col@@ lea@@ gue who works at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch and I said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to do this study , Goog@@ le said no , it &apos;s kind of a bu@@ mm@@ er . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we have the B@@ ing se@@ ar@@ ches . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Y@@ e@@ ah .
That &apos;s great .
Now I fel@@ t like I was — ( Laughter ) I fel@@ t like I was talking to N@@ ick again .
He works for one of the lar@@ g@@ est comp@@ ani@@ es in the world , and I &apos;m already trying to make him feel better .
We not only have B@@ ing se@@ ar@@ ches , but if you use Internet Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ rer to do se@@ ar@@ ches at Goog@@ le , Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , B@@ ing , any ...
So we did a study where we defin@@ ed 50 words that a regu@@ lar person might ty@@ pe in if they &apos;re having hy@@ per@@ g@@ l@@ y@@ ce@@ mi@@ a , like &quot; &quot; fa@@ ti@@ gue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ ss of ap@@ peti@@ te , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ in@@ ating a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ e@@ ing a lot &quot; &quot; — for@@ give me , but that &apos;s one of the things you might ty@@ pe in .
So we had 50 ph@@ ra@@ ses that we called the &quot; &quot; diabe@@ tes words . &quot; &quot; And we did first a base@@ line .
And it tur@@ ns out that about .@@ 5 to one percent of all se@@ ar@@ ches on the Internet invol@@ ve one of those words .
So that &apos;s our base@@ line rate .
If people ty@@ pe in &quot; &quot; par@@ o@@ xe@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; P@@ axi@@ l &quot; &quot; — those are sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ ms — and one of those words , the rate goes up to about two percent of diabe@@ t@@ es@@ -@@ ty@@ pe words , if you already know that there &apos;s that &quot; &quot; par@@ o@@ xe@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; word .
If it &apos;s &quot; &quot; pra@@ vas@@ ta@@ ti@@ n , &quot; &quot; the rate goes up to about three percent from the base@@ line .
If both &quot; &quot; par@@ o@@ xe@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; pra@@ vas@@ ta@@ ti@@ n &quot; &quot; are present in the quer@@ y , it goes up to 10 percent , a hu@@ ge th@@ ree@@ - to f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase in those se@@ ar@@ ches with the two drugs that we were interes@@ ted in , and diabe@@ t@@ es@@ -@@ ty@@ pe words or hy@@ per@@ g@@ l@@ y@@ ce@@ mi@@ a@@ -@@ ty@@ pe words .
We publi@@ sh@@ ed this , and it got some attention .
The reason it des@@ er@@ ves attention is that patients are telling us their side effec@@ ts indi@@ rec@@ tly through their se@@ ar@@ ches .
We b@@ rou@@ ght this to the attention of the F@@ D@@ A .
They were interes@@ ted .
What do I take from this ? Why tell this story ?
Well , first of all , we have now the pro@@ mi@@ se of big data and medi@@ u@@ m@@ -@@ si@@ zed data to help us understand drug interac@@ tions and really , funda@@ ment@@ ally , drug ac@@ tions .
This will create and has cre@@ ated a new eco@@ system for underst@@ an@@ ding how drugs work and to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze their use .
N@@ ick went on ; he &apos;s a profes@@ s@@ or at C@@ ol@@ u@@ mbi@@ a now .
He did this in his P@@ h@@ D for hundre@@ ds of pa@@ ir@@ s of drugs .
He found se@@ ver@@ al very important interac@@ tions , and so we re@@ pli@@ ca@@ ted this and we sho@@ w@@ ed that this is a way that really works for fin@@ ding dru@@ g@@ -@@ drug interac@@ tions .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , there &apos;s a cou@@ ple of things .
We don &apos;t just use pa@@ ir@@ s of drugs at a time .
As I said before , there are patients on three , five , se@@ ven , n@@ ine drugs .
Ha@@ ve they been stu@@ died with res@@ pec@@ t to their n@@ in@@ e@@ -@@ way interac@@ tion ?
Y@@ es , we can do pa@@ ir@@ -@@ wi@@ se , A and B , A and C , A and D , but what about A , B , C , D , E , F , G all together , being ta@@ ken by the same pati@@ ent , per@@ haps interac@@ ting with each other in ways that ei@@ ther makes them more effec@@ tive or less effec@@ tive or caus@@ es side effec@@ ts that are un@@ expec@@ ted ?
We really have no idea .
It &apos;s a blue sk@@ y , open fiel@@ d for us to use data to try to understand the interac@@ tion of drugs .
T@@ w@@ o more l@@ es@@ s@@ ons : I want you to think about the power that we were able to gener@@ ate with the data from people who had vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed their ad@@ ver@@ se reac@@ tions through their ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ci@@ sts , through themselves , through their doc@@ tors , the people who al@@ low@@ ed the da@@ ta@@ b@@ ases at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d , H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t , to be used for research .
But we can &apos;t have a system that clo@@ ses that data off , because it is too ri@@ ch of a s@@ our@@ ce of in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion and disco@@ very for new things in medic@@ ine .
And the final thing I want to say is , in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sa@@ d story .
The two drugs actually ca@@ used problems .
They incre@@ a@@ sed g@@ lu@@ co@@ se .
They could th@@ row somebody into diabe@@ tes who would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se not be in diabe@@ tes , and so you would want to use the two drugs very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly together , per@@ haps not together , make different cho@@ ic@@ es when you &apos;re pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ing .
But there was another pos@@ si@@ bility .
We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interac@@ ting in a ben@@ efici@@ al way .
We could have found new effec@@ ts of drugs that ne@@ i@@ ther of them has al@@ one , but together , instead of ca@@ using a side effec@@ t , they could be a new and no@@ vel tre@@ at@@ ment for dise@@ ases that don &apos;t have tre@@ at@@ ments or where the tre@@ at@@ ments are not effec@@ tive .
If we think about drug tre@@ at@@ ment today , all the ma@@ j@@ or bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s — for H@@ I@@ V , for tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , for depres@@ sion , for diabe@@ tes — it &apos;s always a co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il of drugs .
And so the u@@ p@@ side here , and the sub@@ ject for a different TED Tal@@ k on a different day , is how can we use the same data s@@ our@@ ces to find good effec@@ ts of drugs in com@@ bin@@ ation that will pro@@ vi@@ de us new tre@@ at@@ ments , new in@@ si@@ ghts into how drugs work and en@@ able us to take care of our patients even better ?
Thank you very much .

My j@@ our@@ ne@@ y to become a po@@ lar speci@@ al@@ ist , phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ing , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in the po@@ lar re@@ gi@@ ons , beg@@ an when I was four years old , when my family mo@@ ved from s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Can@@ ada to Nor@@ ther@@ n B@@ af@@ fin Is@@ land , up by Gre@@ en@@ land .
There we li@@ ved with the In@@ u@@ it in the tin@@ y In@@ u@@ it commun@@ ity of 200 In@@ u@@ it people , where &#91; we &#93; were one of three n@@ on-@@ In@@ u@@ it famili@@ es .
And in this commun@@ ity , we didn &apos;t have a tele@@ vi@@ sion ; we didn &apos;t have compu@@ ters , obvi@@ ously , radi@@ o .
We didn &apos;t even have a tele@@ ph@@ one .
All of my time was sp@@ ent out@@ side with the In@@ u@@ it , pla@@ ying .
The s@@ now and the ice were my san@@ d@@ bo@@ x , and the In@@ u@@ it were my teachers .
And that &apos;s where I became tru@@ ly ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed with this po@@ lar re@@ al@@ m .
And I knew some@@ day that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protec@@ t it .
I &apos;d like to share with you , for just two minu@@ tes only , some imag@@ es , a cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of my work , to the beautiful music by B@@ ran@@ di Car@@ li@@ le , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ve You E@@ ver . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know why Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re al@@ lo@@ wing me to show you a few imag@@ es from a co@@ ver@@ age that I &apos;ve just comple@@ ted that is not publi@@ sh@@ ed yet .
Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c doesn &apos;t do this , so I &apos;m very exci@@ ted to be able to share this with you .
And what these imag@@ es are — you &apos;ll see them at the start of the sli@@ de show — there &apos;s only about four imag@@ es — but it &apos;s of a little be@@ ar that lives in the Gre@@ at Be@@ ar R@@ a@@ in@@ for@@ est .
It &apos;s p@@ ure whi@@ te , but it &apos;s not a po@@ lar be@@ ar .
It &apos;s a spi@@ ri@@ t be@@ ar , or a K@@ er@@ mo@@ de be@@ ar .
There are only 200 of these be@@ ar@@ s left .
They &apos;re more r@@ are than the pan@@ da be@@ ar .
I s@@ at there on the ri@@ ver for two months without see@@ ing one .
I thought , my car@@ e@@ er &apos;s over .
I pro@@ pos@@ ed this stu@@ pi@@ d story to Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c .
What in the h@@ ec@@ k was I thinking ?
So I had two months to si@@ t there and figur@@ e out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life , after I was a phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ er , because they were going to fire me .
Because Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c is a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ; they re@@ mind us all the time : they publi@@ sh pic@@ tures , not ex@@ c@@ us@@ es .
( Laughter ) And after two months of si@@ tting there — one day , thinking that it was all over , this incre@@ di@@ ble big whi@@ te mal@@ e came down , right b@@ esi@@ de me , three fe@@ et away from me , and he went down and gra@@ b@@ bed a fish and went off in the for@@ est and ate it .
And then I sp@@ ent the entire day living my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od dre@@ am of wal@@ king around with this be@@ ar through the for@@ est .
He went through this ol@@ d-@@ gro@@ w@@ th for@@ est and s@@ at up b@@ esi@@ de this 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -old cul@@ tur@@ ally mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed t@@ ree and went to s@@ le@@ ep .
And I actually got to s@@ le@@ ep within three fe@@ et of him , just in the for@@ est , and phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h him .
So I &apos;m very exci@@ ted to be able to show you those imag@@ es and a cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of my work that I &apos;ve done on the po@@ lar re@@ gi@@ ons .
P@@ le@@ ase en@@ jo@@ y .

My clo@@ ck is tic@@ king . O@@ K , let &apos;s stop .
Thank you very much . I ap@@ preci@@ ate it .
We &apos;re in@@ un@@ da@@ ted with news all the time that the sea ice is disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing and it &apos;s at its low@@ est level .
And in fact , scienti@@ sts were ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally saying sea ice is going to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar in the next hundre@@ d years , then they said 50 years .
Now they &apos;re saying the sea ice in the Ar@@ c@@ tic , the su@@ m@@ mer@@ time ex@@ t@@ ent is going to be g@@ one in the next four to 10 years .
And what does that mean ?
Af@@ ter a while of read@@ ing this in the news , it just be@@ comes news .
You g@@ la@@ ze over with it .
And what I &apos;m trying to do with my work is put fac@@ es to this .
And I want people to understand and get the concep@@ t that , if we lo@@ se ice , we st@@ and to lo@@ se an entire eco@@ system .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions are that we could lo@@ se po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s , they could become ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t in the next 50 to 100 years .
And there &apos;s no better , se@@ xi@@ er , more beautiful , char@@ is@@ ma@@ tic me@@ ga@@ fa@@ una species for me to han@@ g my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n on .
Po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s are amazing hun@@ ters .
This was a be@@ ar I s@@ at with for a while on the sh@@ ores .
There was no ice around .
But this g@@ la@@ ci@@ er ca@@ ved into the water and a se@@ al got on it .
And this be@@ ar s@@ wa@@ m out to that se@@ al — 8@@ 00 l@@ b@@ . be@@ ar@@ ded se@@ al — gra@@ b@@ bed it , s@@ wa@@ m back and ate it .
And he was so full , he was so happ@@ y and so f@@ at e@@ ating this se@@ al , that , as I appro@@ ach@@ ed him — about 20 fe@@ et away — to get this picture , his only defen@@ se was to keep e@@ ating more se@@ al .
And as he ate , he was so full — he probably had about 200 l@@ b@@ s of me@@ at in his be@@ l@@ ly — and as he ate inside one side of his m@@ outh , he was re@@ gur@@ gi@@ ta@@ ting out the other side of his m@@ outh .
So as long as these be@@ ar@@ s have any bit of ice they will sur@@ vi@@ ve , but it &apos;s the ice that &apos;s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing .
We &apos;re fin@@ ding more and more de@@ ad be@@ ar@@ s in the Ar@@ c@@ tic .
When I worked on po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s as a bio@@ lo@@ g@@ ist 20 years ago , we never found de@@ ad be@@ ar@@ s .
And in the last four or five years , we &apos;re fin@@ ding de@@ ad be@@ ar@@ s po@@ p@@ ping up all over the place .
We &apos;re see@@ ing them in the Be@@ au@@ for@@ t Se@@ a , flo@@ ating in the open ocean where the ice has mel@@ ted out .
I found a cou@@ ple in Nor@@ way last year . We &apos;re see@@ ing them on the ice .
These be@@ ar@@ s are already sho@@ wing si@@ g@@ ns of the st@@ ress of disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing ice .
Here &apos;s a mother and her two year@@ -old cu@@ b were tra@@ vel@@ ing on a ship a hundre@@ d miles of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore in the mi@@ d@@ dle of no@@ where , and they &apos;re ri@@ ding on this big piece of g@@ la@@ ci@@ er ice , which is great for them ; they &apos;re sa@@ fe at this point .
They &apos;re not going to di@@ e of hy@@ po@@ ther@@ mi@@ a .
They &apos;re going to get to land .
But un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , 9@@ 5 percent of the g@@ la@@ ci@@ ers in the Ar@@ c@@ tic are also rece@@ ding right now to the point that the ice is en@@ ding up on land and not in@@ jec@@ ting any ice back into the eco@@ system .
These r@@ ing@@ ed se@@ als , these are the &quot; &quot; f@@ at@@ si@@ c@@ les &quot; &quot; of the Ar@@ c@@ tic .
These little , f@@ at du@@ mp@@ l@@ ings , 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ und b@@ und@@ les of b@@ lu@@ b@@ b@@ er are the ma@@ in@@ sta@@ y of the po@@ lar be@@ ar .
And they &apos;re not like the har@@ b@@ or se@@ als that you have here .
These r@@ ing@@ ed se@@ als also live out their entire life cy@@ cle as@@ soci@@ ated and connec@@ ted to sea ice .
They give bir@@ th inside the ice , and they fe@@ ed on the Ar@@ c@@ tic co@@ d that live under the ice .
And here &apos;s a picture of si@@ ck ice .
This is a piece of multi@@ -@@ year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
And what scienti@@ sts didn &apos;t pre@@ dic@@ t is that , as this ice mel@@ ts , these big po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of black water are for@@ ming and they &apos;re gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing the s@@ un &apos;s energy and ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the mel@@ ting process .
And here we are di@@ ving in the Be@@ au@@ for@@ t Se@@ a .
The visi@@ bility &apos;s 6@@ 00 ft . ; we &apos;re on our sa@@ fe@@ ty lin@@ es ; the ice is mo@@ ving all over the place .
I wis@@ h I could s@@ pen@@ d half an h@@ our telling you about how we almost died on this di@@ ve .
But what &apos;s important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi@@ -@@ year ice , that big ch@@ un@@ k of ice up in the cor@@ ner .
In that one single piece of ice , you have 3@@ 00 species of micro@@ org@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
And in the s@@ pr@@ ing , when the s@@ un re@@ tur@@ ns to the ice , it for@@ ms the phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , gro@@ ws under that ice , and then you get bi@@ gg@@ er s@@ he@@ e@@ ts of se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , and then you get the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ e@@ ding on all that life .
So really what the ice does is it ac@@ ts like a gar@@ den .
It ac@@ ts like the so@@ il in a gar@@ den . It &apos;s an in@@ ver@@ ted gar@@ den .
Lo@@ sing that ice is like lo@@ sing the so@@ il in a gar@@ den .
Here &apos;s me in my of@@ fi@@ ce .
I hope you ap@@ preci@@ ate your@@ s .
This is after an h@@ our under the ice .
I can &apos;t feel my li@@ ps ; my face is fro@@ z@@ en ; I can &apos;t feel my han@@ ds ; I can &apos;t feel my fe@@ et .
And I &apos;ve come up , and all I wanted to do was get out of the water .
Af@@ ter an h@@ our in these condi@@ tions , it &apos;s so extre@@ me that , when I go down , almost every di@@ ve I vo@@ mi@@ t into my regu@@ la@@ tor because my body can &apos;t de@@ al with the st@@ ress of the co@@ ld on my head .
And so I &apos;m just so happ@@ y that the di@@ ve is over .
I get to hand my cam@@ era to my as@@ si@@ st@@ ant , and I &apos;m looking up at him , and I &apos;m going , &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ o . W@@ o@@ o . W@@ o@@ o . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich means , &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke my cam@@ era . &quot; &quot; And he thin@@ ks I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke my picture . &quot; &quot; So we had this little communi@@ cation bre@@ a@@ k@@ down .
( Laughter ) But it &apos;s wor@@ th it .
I &apos;m going to show you pic@@ tures of be@@ lu@@ ga wh@@ al@@ es , bo@@ whe@@ ad wh@@ al@@ es , and n@@ ar@@ wh@@ als , and po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s , and le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other I &apos;ve ever made .
I dro@@ p@@ ped down in this ice ho@@ le , just through that ho@@ le that you just saw , and I looked up under the under@@ side of the ice , and I was di@@ z@@ z@@ y ; I thought I had ver@@ ti@@ go .
I got very ner@@ v@@ ous — no ro@@ pe , no sa@@ fe@@ ty line , the whole world is mo@@ ving around me — and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in t@@ rou@@ ble . &quot; &quot; But what happened is that the entire under@@ side was full of these bi@@ llions of amp@@ hi@@ po@@ ds and co@@ pe@@ po@@ ds mo@@ ving around and fe@@ e@@ ding on the under@@ side of the ice , gi@@ ving bir@@ th and living out their entire life cy@@ cle .
This is the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of the whole food cha@@ in in the Ar@@ c@@ tic , right here .
And when you have low produc@@ tivi@@ ty in this , in ice , the produc@@ tivi@@ ty in co@@ pe@@ po@@ ds go down .
This is a bo@@ whe@@ ad wh@@ al@@ e .
Su@@ p@@ pos@@ e@@ d@@ ly , science is sta@@ ting that it could be the ol@@ des@@ t living animal on ear@@ th right now .
This very wh@@ al@@ e right here could be over 2@@ 50 years old .
This wh@@ al@@ e could have been bor@@ n around the start of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al Re@@ volu@@ tion .
It could have sur@@ vi@@ ved 1@@ 50 years of wh@@ al@@ ing .
And now its bi@@ gg@@ est th@@ re@@ at is the disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance of ice in the Nor@@ th because of the lives that we &apos;re le@@ ad@@ ing in the S@@ outh .
N@@ ar@@ wh@@ als , these ma@@ j@@ esti@@ c n@@ ar@@ wh@@ als with their ei@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ fo@@ o@@ t long i@@ v@@ ory t@@ us@@ ks , don &apos;t have to be here ; they could be out on the open water .
But they &apos;re for@@ c@@ ing themselves to come up in these tin@@ y little ice h@@ ol@@ es where they can bre@@ a@@ the , ca@@ t@@ ch a bre@@ ath , because right under that ice are all the s@@ war@@ ms of co@@ d .
And the co@@ d are there because they are fe@@ e@@ ding on all the co@@ pe@@ po@@ ds and amp@@ hi@@ po@@ ds .
Al@@ right , my fav@@ ori@@ te part .
When I &apos;m on my de@@ a@@ th@@ bed , I &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
E@@ ven though that spi@@ ri@@ t be@@ ar moment was power@@ ful , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever have another experience like I did with these le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als .
Le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als , sin@@ ce the time of S@@ hac@@ k@@ le@@ ton , have had a bad re@@ pu@@ tation .
They &apos;ve got that w@@ r@@ y@@ ly s@@ mi@@ le on their m@@ outh .
They &apos;ve got those black sin@@ is@@ ter eyes and those s@@ po@@ ts on their body .
They look posi@@ tively pre@@ histori@@ c and a bit s@@ car@@ y .
And tra@@ g@@ ic@@ ally in &#91; 200@@ 3 &#93; , a scienti@@ st was ta@@ ken down and dro@@ w@@ ned , and she was being consu@@ med by a le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al .
And people were like , &quot; &quot; We knew they were vi@@ ci@@ ous . We knew they were . &quot; &quot; And so people love to form their op@@ ini@@ ons .
And that &apos;s when I got a story idea : I want to go to An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica , get in the water with as many le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als as I pos@@ si@@ bly can and give them a fa@@ ir s@@ ha@@ ke — find out if they really are these vi@@ ci@@ ous animals , or if they &apos;re mis@@ underst@@ o@@ od .
So this is that story .
Oh , and they also happen to eat H@@ ap@@ p@@ y F@@ e@@ et .
( Laughter ) As a species , as human@@ s , we like to say pen@@ gu@@ ins are really cu@@ te , ther@@ e@@ fore , le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als eat them , so le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als are u@@ g@@ ly and bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
The pen@@ gu@@ in doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s cu@@ te , and the le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s kind of big and mon@@ st@@ ro@@ us .
This is just the food cha@@ in un@@ fol@@ ding .
They &apos;re also big .
They &apos;re not these little har@@ b@@ or se@@ als .
They are 12 f@@ t@@ . long , a thou@@ s@@ and po@@ unds .
And they &apos;re also curi@@ ously ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive .
You get 12 tou@@ ri@@ sts p@@ ac@@ ked into a Z@@ o@@ dia@@ c , flo@@ ating in these ic@@ y wa@@ ters , and a le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al comes up and b@@ it@@ es the pon@@ to@@ on .
The bo@@ at star@@ ts to sin@@ k , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got at@@ tac@@ ked .
All the le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al was doing — it &apos;s just b@@ it@@ ing a bal@@ lo@@ on .
It just se@@ es this big bal@@ lo@@ on in the ocean — it doesn &apos;t have han@@ ds — it &apos;s going to take a little bi@@ te , the bo@@ at po@@ ps , and off they go .
( Laughter ) So after five days of cro@@ s@@ sing the D@@ ra@@ ke P@@ as@@ sa@@ ge — isn &apos;t that beautiful — after five days of cro@@ s@@ sing the D@@ ra@@ ke P@@ as@@ sa@@ ge , we have finally ar@@ ri@@ ved at An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica .
I &apos;m with my S@@ we@@ dis@@ h as@@ si@@ st@@ ant and gu@@ i@@ de .
H@@ is name is G@@ or@@ an E@@ h@@ l@@ me from S@@ we@@ den — G@@ or@@ an .
And he has a lot of experience with le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als . I have never seen one .
So we come around the co@@ ve in our little Z@@ o@@ dia@@ c bo@@ at , and there &apos;s this mon@@ st@@ ro@@ us le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al .
And even in his vo@@ ice , he goes , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a bloo@@ dy big se@@ al , y@@ a . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this se@@ al is taking this pen@@ gu@@ in by the head , and it &apos;s fli@@ p@@ ping it back and for@@ th .
And what it &apos;s trying to do is turn that pen@@ gu@@ in in@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ out , so it can eat the me@@ at off the b@@ ones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
And so this le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ al gra@@ b@@ bed another pen@@ gu@@ in , came under the bo@@ at , the Z@@ o@@ dia@@ c , star@@ ting h@@ it@@ ting the h@@ ul@@ l of the bo@@ at .
And we &apos;re trying to not f@@ all in the water .
And we si@@ t down , and that &apos;s when G@@ or@@ an said to me , &quot; &quot; This is a good se@@ al , y@@ a .
It &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I looked at G@@ or@@ an , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get that . &quot; &quot; But I think I probably used a different word star@@ ting with the le@@ tter &quot; &quot; F@@ . &quot; &quot; But he was right .
He s@@ col@@ ded me out , and said , &quot; &quot; This is why we &apos;re here .
And you pur@@ pos@@ ed this stu@@ pi@@ d story to Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c .
And now you &apos;ve got to de@@ li@@ ver .
And you can &apos;t publi@@ sh ex@@ c@@ us@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I had such dr@@ y m@@ outh — probably not as bad as now — but I had such , such dr@@ y m@@ outh .
And my le@@ gs were just tre@@ mb@@ ling . I coul@@ dn &apos;t feel my le@@ gs .
I put my fli@@ p@@ per@@ s on . I could bar@@ e@@ ly part my li@@ ps .
I put my s@@ nor@@ k@@ el in my m@@ outh , and I ro@@ l@@ led over the side of the Z@@ o@@ dia@@ c into the water .
And this was the first thing she did .
She came rac@@ ing up to me , eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed my whole cam@@ era — and her te@@ e@@ th are up here and down here — but G@@ or@@ an , before I had g@@ ot@@ ten in the water , had given me amazing ad@@ vi@@ ce .
He said , &quot; &quot; If you get s@@ car@@ ed , you clo@@ se your eyes , y@@ a , and she &apos;ll go away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s all I had to work with at that point .
But I just started to sho@@ o@@ t these pic@@ tures .
So she did this th@@ re@@ at dis@@ play for a few minu@@ tes , and then the most amazing thing happened — she tot@@ ally rela@@ x@@ ed .
She went off , she got a pen@@ gu@@ in .
She st@@ op@@ ped about 10 fe@@ et away from me , and she s@@ at there with this pen@@ gu@@ in , the pen@@ gu@@ in &apos;s f@@ la@@ p@@ ping , and she let &apos;s it go .
The pen@@ gu@@ in s@@ w@@ im@@ s to@@ ward me , takes off .
She gra@@ b@@ s another one . She does this over and over .
And it da@@ w@@ ned on me that she &apos;s trying to fe@@ ed me a pen@@ gu@@ in .
Why else would she re@@ le@@ ase these pen@@ gu@@ ins at me ?
And after she did this four or five times , she s@@ wa@@ m by me with this de@@ jec@@ ted look on her face .
You don &apos;t want to be too an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ mor@@ phi@@ c , but I s@@ we@@ ar that she looked at me like , &quot; &quot; This u@@ sel@@ ess pre@@ da@@ tor &apos;s going to star@@ ve in my ocean . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So realiz@@ ing I coul@@ dn &apos;t ca@@ t@@ ch s@@ w@@ im@@ ming pen@@ gu@@ ins , she &apos;d get these other pen@@ gu@@ ins and br@@ ing them s@@ low@@ ly to@@ war@@ ds me , bo@@ b@@ b@@ ing like this , and she &apos;d let them go .
This didn &apos;t work .
I was la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing so hard and so emo@@ tional that my mas@@ k was f@@ loo@@ ding , because I was cr@@ ying under@@ water , just because it was so amazing .
And so that didn &apos;t work .
So then she &apos;d get another pen@@ gu@@ in and try this bal@@ le@@ t@@ -@@ like sex@@ y dis@@ play sli@@ ding down this ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g like this . ( Laughter ) And she would sort of br@@ ing them over to me and of@@ fer it to me .
This went on for four days .
This just didn &apos;t happen a cou@@ ple of times .
And then so she realiz@@ ed I coul@@ dn &apos;t ca@@ t@@ ch live ones , so she b@@ rou@@ ght me de@@ ad pen@@ gu@@ ins .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;ve got four or five pen@@ gu@@ ins flo@@ ating around my head , and I &apos;m just si@@ tting there sho@@ ot@@ ing away .
And she would of@@ ten stop and have this de@@ jec@@ ted look on her face like , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you for real ? &quot; &quot; Because she can &apos;t believe I can &apos;t eat this pen@@ gu@@ in .
Because in her world , you &apos;re ei@@ ther bre@@ e@@ ding or you &apos;re e@@ ating — and I &apos;m not bre@@ e@@ ding , so ...
( Laughter ) And then that was@@ n &apos;t enough ; she started to fli@@ p pen@@ gu@@ ins on@@ to my head .
She was trying to for@@ ce@@ -@@ fe@@ ed me . She &apos;s p@@ us@@ hing me around .
She &apos;s trying to for@@ ce@@ -@@ fe@@ ed my cam@@ era , which is every phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ er &apos;s dre@@ am .
And she would get f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted ; she &apos;d b@@ low bu@@ b@@ bles in my face .
She would , I think , let me know that I was going to star@@ ve .
But yet she didn &apos;t stop .
She would not stop trying to fe@@ ed me pen@@ gu@@ ins .
And on the last day with this fe@@ mal@@ e where I thought I had p@@ us@@ h@@ ed her too far , I got ner@@ v@@ ous because she came up to me , she ro@@ l@@ led over on her back , and she did this de@@ ep , gu@@ t@@ tural j@@ ac@@ k@@ ha@@ mm@@ er sound , this go@@ k@@ -@@ go@@ k@@ -@@ go@@ k@@ -@@ go@@ k .
And I thought , she &apos;s about to bi@@ te .
She &apos;s about to let me know she &apos;s too f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted with me .
What had happened was another se@@ al had s@@ nuc@@ k in be@@ hind me , and she did that to th@@ re@@ at dis@@ play .
She cha@@ sed that big se@@ al away , went and got its pen@@ gu@@ in and b@@ rou@@ ght it to me .
( Laughter ) That was@@ n &apos;t the only se@@ al I got in the water with .
I got in the water with 30 other le@@ o@@ par@@ d se@@ als , and I never on@@ ce had a s@@ car@@ y en@@ coun@@ ter .
They are the most re@@ mar@@ k@@ able animals I &apos;ve ever worked with , and the same with po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s .
And just like the po@@ lar be@@ ar@@ s , these animals depen@@ d on an ic@@ y environment .
I get emo@@ tional . S@@ or@@ ry .
It &apos;s a story that lives de@@ ep in my heart , and I &apos;m pro@@ u@@ d to share this with you .
And I &apos;m so pas@@ sion@@ ate about it .
An@@ y@@ body want to come with me to An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica or the Ar@@ c@@ tic , I &apos;ll take you ; let &apos;s go .
We &apos;ve got to get the story out now . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
So@@ me@@ thing called the D@@ an@@ is@@ h T@@ w@@ in S@@ tu@@ dy esta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ed that only about 10 percent of how long the a@@ ver@@ age person lives , within cer@@ tain bio@@ logical limi@@ ts , is dic@@ ta@@ ted by our genes .
The other 90 percent is dic@@ ta@@ ted by our li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
So the pre@@ mi@@ se of B@@ lue Z@@ ones : if we can find the op@@ ti@@ mal li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le of lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty we can come up with a de fac@@ to for@@ mul@@ a for lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
But if you ask the a@@ ver@@ age Ameri@@ can what the op@@ ti@@ mal for@@ mul@@ a of lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty is , they probably coul@@ dn &apos;t tell you .
They &apos;ve probably heard of the S@@ outh Be@@ ach D@@ i@@ et , or the A@@ t@@ kin@@ s D@@ i@@ et .
You have the U@@ S@@ D@@ A food p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
There is what O@@ pra@@ h te@@ lls us .
There is what D@@ oc@@ tor O@@ z te@@ lls us .
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of con@@ fu@@ sion around what really hel@@ ps us live lon@@ ger better .
S@@ h@@ ould you be run@@ ning mar@@ a@@ th@@ ons or doing y@@ o@@ ga ?
S@@ h@@ ould you eat organi@@ c me@@ at@@ s or should you be e@@ ating to@@ f@@ u ?
When it comes to sup@@ ple@@ ments , should you be taking them ?
How about these hormon@@ es or res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l ?
And does pur@@ pos@@ e play into it ?
S@@ pi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality ? And how about how we soci@@ aliz@@ e ?
Well , our appro@@ ach to fin@@ ding lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty was to te@@ am up with Na@@ tional Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c , and the Na@@ tional In@@ stitu@@ te on Ag@@ ing , to find the four demo@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ ally con@@ fir@@ med are@@ as that are ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic@@ ally defin@@ ed .
And then br@@ ing a te@@ am of ex@@ per@@ ts in there to me@@ th@@ o@@ dic@@ ally go through exactly what these people do , to di@@ still down the cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ cul@@ tural di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation .
And at the end of this I &apos;m going to tell you what that di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation is .
But first I &apos;d like to de@@ bun@@ k some common my@@ ths when it comes to lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
And the first my@@ th is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
F@@ al@@ se .
The problem is , only about one out of 5@@ ,000 people in America live to be 100 .
Y@@ our chan@@ ces are very low .
E@@ ven though it &apos;s the fa@@ st@@ est gro@@ wing demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c in America , it &apos;s hard to re@@ ach 100 .
The problem is that we &apos;re not progra@@ m@@ med for lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
We are progra@@ m@@ med for something called pro@@ crea@@ tive suc@@ cess .
I love that word .
It re@@ min@@ ds me of my colle@@ ge days .
B@@ i@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ter@@ m pro@@ crea@@ tive suc@@ cess to mean the age where you have children and then another gener@@ ation , the age when your children have children .
Af@@ ter that the effec@@ t of evolu@@ tion comple@@ tely dis@@ si@@ pa@@ tes .
If you &apos;re a ma@@ m@@ mal , if you &apos;re a r@@ at or an ele@@ ph@@ ant , or a human , in between , it &apos;s the same story .
So to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le , you also have to have w@@ on the genetic l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
The second my@@ th is , there are tre@@ at@@ ments that can help s@@ low , re@@ ver@@ se , or even stop aging .
F@@ al@@ se .
When you think of it , there is 9@@ 9 things that can age us .
De@@ pri@@ ve your brain of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen for just a few minu@@ tes , those brain cells di@@ e , they never come back .
P@@ la@@ y ten@@ n@@ is too hard , on your k@@ ne@@ es , ru@@ in your car@@ ti@@ la@@ ge , the car@@ ti@@ la@@ ge never comes back .
Ou@@ r ar@@ teri@@ es can clo@@ g . Ou@@ r bra@@ ins can gun@@ k up with pla@@ que , and we can get Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s .
There is just too many things to go wrong .
Ou@@ r bo@@ dies have 3@@ 5 tri@@ llion cells , tri@@ llion with a &quot; &quot; T@@ . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re talking national de@@ b@@ t nu@@ mb@@ ers here .
( Laughter ) Th@@ ose cells turn themselves over on@@ ce every ei@@ ght years .
And every time they turn themselves over there is some da@@ ma@@ ge . And that da@@ ma@@ ge buil@@ ds up .
And it buil@@ ds up ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
It &apos;s a little bit like the days when we all had Be@@ at@@ les al@@ bu@@ ms or E@@ ag@@ les al@@ bu@@ ms and we &apos;d make a co@@ p@@ y of that on a ca@@ s@@ se@@ t@@ te ta@@ pe , and let our fri@@ ends co@@ p@@ y that ca@@ s@@ se@@ t@@ te ta@@ pe , and pretty so@@ on , with suc@@ ces@@ sive gener@@ ations that ta@@ pe so@@ unds like gar@@ b@@ age .
Well , the same things happen to our cells .
That &apos;s why a 6@@ 5@@ -@@ year@@ -old person is aging at a rate of about 1@@ 25 times fas@@ ter than a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old person .
So , if there is nothing you can do to s@@ low your aging or stop your aging , what am I doing here ?
Well , the fact of the matter is the best science te@@ lls us that the capaci@@ ty of the human body , my body , your body , is about 90 years , a little bit more for wo@@ men .
But life expec@@ tan@@ cy in this country is only 7@@ 8 .
So some@@ where al@@ ong the line , we &apos;re lea@@ ving about 12 good years on the table .
These are years that we could get .
And research sho@@ ws that they would be years lar@@ ge@@ ly f@@ ree of ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ c disease , heart disease , cancer and diabe@@ tes .
We think the best way to get these mis@@ sing years is to look at the cul@@ tures around the world that are actually experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing them , are@@ as where people are living to age 100 at ra@@ tes up to 10 times gre@@ ater than we are , are@@ as where the life expec@@ tan@@ cy is an ex@@ tra do@@ z@@ en years , the rate of mi@@ d@@ dle age mor@@ tal@@ ity is a f@@ rac@@ tion of what it is in this country .
We found our first B@@ lue Z@@ one about 1@@ 25 miles off the co@@ ast of I@@ tal@@ y , on the is@@ land of S@@ ar@@ din@@ ia .
And not the entire is@@ land , the is@@ land is about 1@@ .@@ 4 million people , but only up in the high@@ lan@@ ds , an are@@ a called the N@@ u@@ or@@ o pro@@ vin@@ ce .
And here we have this are@@ a where men live the lon@@ g@@ est , about 10 times more cent@@ en@@ ari@@ ans than we have here in America .
And this is a place where people not only re@@ ach age 100 , they do so with extraordin@@ ary vi@@ g@@ or .
P@@ l@@ aces where 10@@ 2 year ol@@ ds still ri@@ de their bi@@ ke to work , cho@@ p wo@@ od , and can be@@ at a guy 60 years youn@@ ger than them .
( Laughter ) Th@@ e@@ ir hist@@ ory actually goes back to about the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st .
It &apos;s actually a B@@ ron@@ ze A@@ ge culture that &apos;s been i@@ so@@ la@@ ted .
Because the land is so in@@ fer@@ ti@@ le , they lar@@ ge@@ ly are s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , which oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ons regu@@ lar , low@@ -@@ inten@@ si@@ ty physical activi@@ ty .
Th@@ e@@ ir di@@ et is most@@ ly plan@@ t@@ -@@ based , ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated with fo@@ o@@ ds that they can car@@ ry into the fiel@@ ds .
They came up with an un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed whole whe@@ at bre@@ ad called car@@ ta mu@@ sica made out of dur@@ um whe@@ at , a ty@@ pe of che@@ ese made from gra@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ f@@ ed animals so the che@@ ese is high in O@@ me@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty a@@ ci@@ ds instead of O@@ me@@ ga@@ -@@ 6 f@@ at@@ ty a@@ ci@@ ds from cor@@ n@@ -@@ f@@ ed animals , and a ty@@ pe of w@@ ine that has three times the level of po@@ l@@ y@@ ph@@ en@@ ols than any kno@@ wn w@@ ine in the world .
It &apos;s called Can@@ n@@ on@@ a@@ u .
But the real se@@ cre@@ t I think li@@ es more in the way that they organi@@ ze their socie@@ ty .
And one of the most s@@ ali@@ ent ele@@ ments of the S@@ ar@@ din@@ i@@ an socie@@ ty is how they tre@@ at ol@@ der people .
You ever no@@ tice here in America , social equ@@ ity see@@ ms to pe@@ ak at about age 2@@ 4 ?
J@@ ust look at the ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments .
Here in S@@ ar@@ din@@ ia , the ol@@ der you get the more equ@@ ity you have , the more wis@@ dom you &apos;re ce@@ le@@ bra@@ ted for .
You go into the bar@@ s in S@@ ar@@ din@@ ia , instead of see@@ ing the S@@ por@@ ts I@@ ll@@ u@@ stra@@ ted s@@ w@@ im@@ su@@ it cal@@ en@@ dar , you see the cent@@ en@@ ari@@ an of the mon@@ th cal@@ en@@ dar .
This , as it tur@@ ns out , is not only good for your aging parents to keep them clo@@ se to the family — it im@@ par@@ ts about four to six years of ex@@ tra life expec@@ tan@@ cy — research sho@@ ws it &apos;s also good for the children of those famili@@ es , who have lo@@ wer ra@@ tes of mor@@ tal@@ ity and lo@@ wer ra@@ tes of disease .
That &apos;s called the gran@@ d@@ mother effec@@ t .
We found our second B@@ lue Z@@ one on the other side of the plan@@ et , about 8@@ 00 miles s@@ outh of To@@ k@@ y@@ o , on the ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go of O@@ kin@@ aw@@ a .
O@@ kin@@ aw@@ a is actually 1@@ 6@@ 1 small is@@ lan@@ ds .
And in the nor@@ ther@@ n part of the ma@@ in is@@ land , this is ground z@@ ero for world lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
This is a place where the ol@@ des@@ t living fe@@ mal@@ e population is found .
It &apos;s a place where people have the lon@@ g@@ est disa@@ bili@@ ty@@ -@@ f@@ ree life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the world .
They have what we want .
They live a long time , and ten@@ d to di@@ e in their s@@ le@@ ep , very qu@@ ick@@ ly , and of@@ ten , I can tell you , after se@@ x .
They live about se@@ ven good years lon@@ ger than the a@@ ver@@ age Ameri@@ can .
F@@ i@@ ve times as many cent@@ en@@ ari@@ ans as we have in America .
One fi@@ f@@ th the rate of col@@ on and bre@@ ast cancer , big ki@@ ll@@ ers here in America .
And one si@@ x@@ th the rate of car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cular disease .
And the fact that this culture has y@@ i@@ el@@ ded these nu@@ mb@@ ers su@@ gg@@ est@@ s st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly they have something to te@@ ach us .
What do they do ?
O@@ n@@ ce again , a plan@@ t@@ -@@ based di@@ et , full of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bles with l@@ ots of col@@ or in them .
And they eat about ei@@ ght times as much to@@ f@@ u as Amer@@ ic@@ ans do .
M@@ ore signifi@@ can@@ t than what they eat is how they eat it .
They have all kinds of little stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es to keep from over@@ e@@ ating , which , as you know , is a big problem here in America .
A few of the stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es we obser@@ ved : they eat off of s@@ mal@@ ler pla@@ tes , so they ten@@ d to eat fe@@ wer cal@@ ories at every si@@ tting .
In@@ stead of ser@@ ving family st@@ y@@ le , where you can sort of min@@ d@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly eat as you &apos;re talking , they ser@@ ve at the coun@@ ter , put the food away , and then br@@ ing it to the table .
They also have a 3@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -old ada@@ ge , which I think is the gre@@ at@@ est sort of di@@ et su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion ever in@@ ven@@ ted .
It was in@@ ven@@ ted by Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
And that di@@ et is kno@@ wn as the H@@ ara , H@@ at@@ ch@@ i , B@@ u di@@ et .
It &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their me@@ al to re@@ mind them to stop e@@ ating when their sto@@ m@@ ach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .
It takes about a half h@@ our for that full fe@@ el@@ ing to tra@@ vel from your be@@ l@@ ly to your brain .
And by re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing to stop at 80 percent it hel@@ ps keep you from doing that very thing .
But , like S@@ ar@@ din@@ ia , O@@ kin@@ aw@@ a has a few social con@@ struc@@ ts that we can as@@ soci@@ ate with lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
We know that i@@ so@@ lation ki@@ lls .
F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en years ago , the a@@ ver@@ age Ameri@@ can had three good fri@@ ends .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
If you were l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough to be bor@@ n in O@@ kin@@ aw@@ a , you were bor@@ n into a system where you auto@@ ma@@ tically have a half a do@@ z@@ en fri@@ ends with who@@ m you tra@@ vel through life .
They call it a Mo@@ a@@ i . And if you &apos;re in a Mo@@ a@@ i you &apos;re expec@@ ted to share the bo@@ un@@ ty if you en@@ coun@@ ter l@@ uc@@ k , and if things go bad , child gets si@@ ck , par@@ ent dies , you always have somebody who has your back .
This particular Mo@@ a@@ i , these five la@@ dies have been together for 9@@ 7 years .
Th@@ e@@ ir a@@ ver@@ age age is 10@@ 2 .
T@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in America we &apos;ve divi@@ ded our adul@@ t life up into two sec@@ tions .
There is our work life , where we &apos;re produc@@ tive .
And then one day , bo@@ o@@ m , we re@@ ti@@ re .
And ty@@ pic@@ ally that has me@@ ant re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing to the e@@ as@@ y cha@@ ir , or going down to A@@ ri@@ zona to play g@@ ol@@ f .
In the O@@ kin@@ aw@@ an language there is not even a word for re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
In@@ stead there is one word that im@@ bu@@ es your entire life , and that word is &quot; &quot; i@@ ki@@ ga@@ i . &quot; &quot; And , rou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ la@@ ted , it means &quot; the reason for which you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning . &quot;
For this 10@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old k@@ ar@@ ate mas@@ ter , his i@@ ki@@ ga@@ i was car@@ r@@ ying for@@ th this mar@@ ti@@ al art .
For this hundre@@ d-@@ year@@ -old fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man it was continu@@ ing to ca@@ t@@ ch fish for his family three times a wee@@ k .
And this is a question . The Na@@ tional In@@ stitu@@ te on Ag@@ ing actually ga@@ ve us a ques@@ tion@@ na@@ i@@ re to give these cent@@ en@@ ari@@ ans .
And one of the ques@@ tions , they were very cul@@ tur@@ ally a@@ stu@@ te , the people who put the ques@@ tion@@ na@@ i@@ re .
One of the ques@@ tions was , &quot; &quot; What is your i@@ ki@@ ga@@ i ? &quot; &quot; They in@@ stan@@ tly knew why they wo@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning .
For this 10@@ 2 year old woman , her i@@ ki@@ ga@@ i was simply her gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ ghter .
T@@ w@@ o gir@@ ls separ@@ ated in age by 10@@ 1 and a half years .
And I asked her what it fel@@ t like to h@@ old a gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ ghter .
And she put her head back and she said , &quot; It fe@@ els like le@@ ap@@ ing into he@@ a@@ ven . &quot;
I thought that was a wonderful thought .
My edi@@ tor at Ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c wanted me to find America &apos;s B@@ lue Z@@ one .
And for a while we looked on the pra@@ i@@ ri@@ es of M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a , where actually there is a very high pro@@ por@@ tion of cent@@ en@@ ari@@ ans .
But that &apos;s because all the young people left .
( Laughter ) So , we tur@@ ned to the data again .
And we found America &apos;s lon@@ g@@ est@@ -@@ li@@ ved population a@@ mon@@ g the Se@@ ven@@ th@@ -@@ D@@ ay A@@ d@@ venti@@ sts con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted in and around Lo@@ ma L@@ in@@ da , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
A@@ d@@ venti@@ sts are con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ dist@@ s .
They ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te their S@@ ab@@ b@@ ath from s@@ un@@ set on F@@ ri@@ day ti@@ ll s@@ un@@ set on S@@ atur@@ day .
A &quot; &quot; 2@@ 4@@ -@@ h@@ our san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in time , &quot; &quot; they call it .
And they fol@@ low five little hab@@ its that con@@ ve@@ ys to them extraordin@@ ary lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , compar@@ a@@ tively spe@@ a@@ king .
In America here , life expec@@ tan@@ cy for the a@@ ver@@ age woman is 80 .
But for an A@@ d@@ venti@@ st woman , their life expec@@ tan@@ cy is 8@@ 9 .
And the differ@@ ence is even more pro@@ no@@ un@@ ced a@@ mon@@ g men , who are expec@@ ted to live about 1@@ 1 years lon@@ ger than their Ameri@@ can coun@@ ter@@ par@@ ts .
Now , this is a study that fol@@ low@@ ed about 7@@ 0@@ ,000 people for 30 years .
S@@ ter@@ ling study . And I think it su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tes the pre@@ mi@@ se of this B@@ lue Z@@ one project .
This is a he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous commun@@ ity .
It &apos;s whi@@ te , black , H@@ is@@ p@@ ani@@ c , A@@ si@@ an .
The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le hab@@ its that they fol@@ low ri@@ tu@@ al@@ is@@ tically for most of their lives .
They take their di@@ et direc@@ tly from the B@@ i@@ ble .
G@@ en@@ esis : C@@ hap@@ ter one , V@@ er@@ se &#91; 2@@ 9 &#93; , where God tal@@ ks about le@@ gu@@ mes and see@@ ds , and on one more st@@ anza about green plan@@ ts , o@@ st@@ en@@ si@@ bly mis@@ sing is me@@ at .
They take this san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in time very seri@@ ous .
For 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s every wee@@ k , no matter how bus@@ y they are , how st@@ res@@ sed out they are at work , where the kids need to be dri@@ ven , they stop everything and they fo@@ c@@ us on their God , their social ne@@ t@@ work , and then , har@@ d@@ wi@@ red right in the reli@@ gi@@ on , are n@@ ature wal@@ ks .
And the power of this is not that it &apos;s done oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , the power is it &apos;s done every wee@@ k for a li@@ fe@@ time .
N@@ one of it &apos;s hard . N@@ one of it co@@ sts money .
A@@ d@@ venti@@ sts also ten@@ d to han@@ g out with other A@@ d@@ venti@@ sts .
So , if you go to an A@@ d@@ venti@@ st &apos;s par@@ ty you don &apos;t see people s@@ wi@@ lling J@@ i@@ m Be@@ am or ro@@ lling a jo@@ int .
In@@ stead they &apos;re talking about their next n@@ ature wal@@ k , ex@@ chan@@ ging reci@@ pes , and y@@ es , they pra@@ y .
But they inf@@ lu@@ ence each other in pro@@ found and meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble ways .
This is a culture that has y@@ i@@ el@@ ded E@@ ll@@ s@@ wor@@ th Wh@@ are@@ ha@@ m .
E@@ ll@@ s@@ wor@@ th Wh@@ are@@ ha@@ m is 9@@ 7 years old .
He &apos;s a multi@@ mi@@ lli@@ on@@ ai@@ re , yet when a contra@@ c@@ tor wanted 6@@ ,000 dollars to build a pri@@ vac@@ y f@@ ence , he said , &quot; &quot; For that kind of money I &apos;ll do it myself . &quot; &quot; So for the next three days he was out sho@@ vel@@ ing ce@@ ment , and ha@@ ul@@ ing po@@ les around .
And pre@@ dic@@ ta@@ bly , per@@ haps , on the f@@ our@@ th day he en@@ ded up in the oper@@ ating room .
But not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing op@@ en@@ -@@ heart sur@@ ger@@ y .
A@@ t 9@@ 7 he still does 20 op@@ en@@ -@@ heart sur@@ ger@@ ies every mon@@ th .
E@@ d R@@ aw@@ l@@ ings , 10@@ 3 years old now , an ac@@ tive co@@ w@@ bo@@ y , star@@ ts his mor@@ ning with a s@@ wi@@ m .
And on wee@@ k@@ ends he li@@ kes to put on the bo@@ ar@@ ds , th@@ row up roo@@ s@@ ter ta@@ il@@ s .
And then Mar@@ ge De@@ ton .
Mar@@ ge is 10@@ 4 .
H@@ er gran@@ d@@ son actually lives in the T@@ w@@ in C@@ i@@ ties here .
She star@@ ts her day with li@@ f@@ ting we@@ i@@ ghts .
She ri@@ des her b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
And then she gets in her ro@@ ot@@ -@@ be@@ er co@@ lo@@ red 19@@ 9@@ 4 C@@ adi@@ l@@ la@@ c Se@@ vi@@ lle , and te@@ ar@@ s down the S@@ an B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ din@@ o f@@ ree@@ way , where she still vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers for se@@ ven different organi@@ z@@ ations .
I &apos;ve been on 1@@ 9 har@@ d@@ co@@ re ex@@ pedi@@ tions .
I &apos;m probably the only person you &apos;ll ever me@@ et who ro@@ de his b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle across the Sa@@ h@@ ara des@@ er@@ t without s@@ un@@ s@@ cre@@ en .
But I &apos;ll tell you , there is no ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure more har@@ ro@@ wing than ri@@ ding sh@@ ot@@ g@@ un with Mar@@ ge De@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; A st@@ ran@@ ger is a fri@@ end I ha@@ ven &apos;t me@@ t yet ! &quot; &quot; she &apos;d say to me .
So , what are the common den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ ors in these three cul@@ tures ?
What are the things that they all do ?
And we man@@ ag@@ ed to bo@@ il it down to n@@ ine .
In fact we &apos;ve done two more B@@ lue Z@@ one ex@@ pedi@@ tions sin@@ ce this and these common den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ ors h@@ old true .
And the first one , and I &apos;m about to u@@ tter a her@@ es@@ y here , n@@ one of them exer@@ ci@@ se , at le@@ ast the way we think of exer@@ ci@@ se .
In@@ stead , they set up their lives so that they are con@@ stan@@ tly n@@ ud@@ ged into physical activi@@ ty .
These 10@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -old O@@ kin@@ aw@@ an wo@@ men are getting up and down off the ground , they si@@ t on the flo@@ or , 30 or 40 times a day .
S@@ ar@@ din@@ i@@ ans live in ver@@ tical h@@ ou@@ ses , up and down the sta@@ ir@@ s .
E@@ very tri@@ p to the st@@ ore , or to ch@@ ur@@ ch or to a fri@@ end &apos;s house oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ons a wal@@ k .
They don &apos;t have any conven@@ i@@ ences .
There is not a bu@@ tt@@ on to p@@ us@@ h to do y@@ ard work or house work .
If they want to mi@@ x up a ca@@ ke , they &apos;re doing it by hand .
That &apos;s physical activi@@ ty .
That bur@@ ns cal@@ ories just as much as going on the tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ ll does .
When they do do inten@@ tional physical activi@@ ty , it &apos;s the things they en@@ jo@@ y . They ten@@ d to wal@@ k , the only pro@@ ven way to sta@@ ve off co@@ gni@@ tive de@@ c@@ line , and they all ten@@ d to have a gar@@ den .
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right out@@ look .
E@@ ach of these cul@@ tures take time to do@@ w@@ n@@ shi@@ ft .
The S@@ ar@@ din@@ i@@ ans pra@@ y . The Se@@ ven@@ th@@ -@@ D@@ ay A@@ d@@ venti@@ sts pra@@ y .
The O@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans have this an@@ c@@ est@@ or ven@@ er@@ ation .
But when you &apos;re in a h@@ ur@@ ry or st@@ res@@ sed out , that tri@@ gg@@ ers something called the inf@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ t@@ ory respon@@ se , which is as@@ soci@@ ated with everything from Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s disease to car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cular disease .
When you s@@ low down for 15 minu@@ tes a day you turn that inf@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ t@@ ory sta@@ te into a more anti@@ -@@ inf@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ t@@ ory sta@@ te .
They have vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ary for sense of pur@@ pos@@ e , i@@ ki@@ ga@@ i , like the O@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans .
You know the two most dan@@ ger@@ ous years in your life are the year you &apos;re bor@@ n , because of inf@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity , and the year you re@@ ti@@ re .
These people know their sense of pur@@ pos@@ e , and they activ@@ ate in their life , that &apos;s wor@@ th about se@@ ven years of ex@@ tra life expec@@ tan@@ cy .
There &apos;s no lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty di@@ et .
In@@ stead , these people dr@@ in@@ k a little bit every day , not a hard se@@ ll to the Ameri@@ can population .
( Laughter ) They ten@@ d to eat a plan@@ t@@ -@@ based di@@ et .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t eat me@@ at , but l@@ ots of be@@ ans and nu@@ ts .
And they have stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es to keep from over@@ e@@ ating , little things that n@@ ud@@ ge them away from the table at the right time .
And then the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of all this is how they connec@@ t .
They put their famili@@ es first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
They all ten@@ d to be@@ long to a fa@@ i@@ th@@ -@@ based commun@@ ity , which is wor@@ th between four and 1@@ 4 ex@@ tra years of life expec@@ tan@@ cy if you do it four times a mon@@ th .
And the bi@@ gg@@ est thing here is they also be@@ long to the right tri@@ be .
They were ei@@ ther bor@@ n into or they pro@@ ac@@ tively sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded themselves with the right people .
We know from the F@@ ra@@ m@@ ing@@ ha@@ m stu@@ dies , that if your three best fri@@ ends are ob@@ ese there is a 50 percent better chan@@ ce that you &apos;ll be over@@ we@@ ight .
So , if you han@@ g out with un@@ health@@ y people , that &apos;s going to have a meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble impac@@ t over time .
In@@ stead , if your fri@@ end &apos;s idea of re@@ cre@@ ation is physical activi@@ ty , bo@@ w@@ ling , or pla@@ ying ho@@ c@@ k@@ ey , bi@@ king or gar@@ den@@ ing , if your fri@@ ends dr@@ in@@ k a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they &apos;re eng@@ ag@@ ed , and they &apos;re tru@@ st@@ ing and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , that is going to have the bi@@ gg@@ est impac@@ t over time .
D@@ i@@ e@@ ts don &apos;t work . No di@@ et in the hist@@ ory of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .
E@@ xer@@ ci@@ se progra@@ ms us@@ u@@ ally start in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary ; they &apos;re us@@ u@@ ally done by O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er .
When it comes to lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty there is no sh@@ or@@ t ter@@ m fi@@ x in a p@@ ill or anything else .
But when you think about it , your fri@@ ends are lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es , and ther@@ e@@ fore , per@@ haps the most signifi@@ can@@ t thing you can do to ad@@ d more years to your life , and life to your years . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a man who &apos;s trying to live from his heart , and so just before I get going , I wanted to tell you as a S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ can that one of the men who has in@@ spi@@ red me most pas@@ sed away a few h@@ our@@ s ago .
N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela has come to the end of his long wal@@ k to f@@ ree@@ dom .
And so this talk is going to be for him .
I gre@@ w up in won@@ der .
I gre@@ w up a@@ mon@@ g@@ st those animals .
I gre@@ w up in the w@@ il@@ d e@@ a@@ ster@@ n part of S@@ outh Africa at a place called L@@ on@@ do@@ lo@@ z@@ i G@@ ame R@@ es@@ er@@ ve .
It &apos;s a place where my family has been in the sa@@ far@@ i bus@@ in@@ ess for four gener@@ ations .
Now for as long as I can remember , my job has been to take people out into n@@ ature , and so I think it &apos;s a lo@@ vely tw@@ ist of fa@@ te today to have the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to br@@ ing some of my experi@@ ences out in n@@ ature in to this ga@@ ther@@ ing .
Africa is a place where people still si@@ t under star@@ li@@ t s@@ ki@@ es and around camp@@ fir@@ es and tell stories , and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medic@@ ine of a few camp@@ fire stories , stories about her@@ o@@ es of heart .
Now my stories are not the stories that you &apos;ll he@@ ar on the news , and while it &apos;s true that Africa is a har@@ sh place , I also know it to be a place where people , animals and eco@@ syste@@ ms te@@ ach us about a more inter@@ connec@@ ted world .
When I was n@@ ine years old , P@@ res@@ id@@ ent Man@@ dela came to sta@@ y with my family .
He had just been re@@ lea@@ sed from his 2@@ 7 years of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , and was in a peri@@ od of read@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment to his su@@ d@@ den global i@@ con sta@@ tu@@ s .
M@@ e@@ mb@@ ers of the A@@ fri@@ can Na@@ tional Con@@ g@@ ress thought that in the bus@@ h he would have time to res@@ t and recu@@ per@@ ate away from the publi@@ c ey@@ e , and it &apos;s true that li@@ ons ten@@ d to be a very good de@@ ter@@ r@@ ent to pres@@ s and pa@@ par@@ az@@ z@@ i .
( Laughter ) But it was a defin@@ ing time for me as a young bo@@ y .
I would take him bre@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ ast in bed , and then , in an old tra@@ ck su@@ it and sli@@ p@@ per@@ s , he would go for a wal@@ k around the gar@@ den .
A@@ t ni@@ ght , I would si@@ t with my family around the s@@ no@@ w@@ y , bun@@ n@@ y@@ -@@ ear@@ ed T@@ V , and wat@@ ch imag@@ es of that same qui@@ et man from the gar@@ den sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by hundre@@ ds and thousands of people as s@@ cen@@ es from his re@@ le@@ ase were bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st ni@@ gh@@ tly .
He was br@@ ing@@ ing pe@@ ace to a divi@@ ded and viol@@ ent S@@ outh Africa , one man with an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able sense of his human@@ ity .
Man@@ dela said of@@ ten that the gi@@ ft of pri@@ son was the ability to go within and to think , to create in hi@@ m@@ self the things he most wanted for S@@ outh Africa : pe@@ ace , re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , har@@ mon@@ y .
Th@@ rou@@ gh this ac@@ t of im@@ men@@ se op@@ en@@ -@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ness , he was to become the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of what in S@@ outh Africa we call &quot; &quot; u@@ bun@@ t@@ u . &quot; &quot; U@@ bun@@ t@@ u : I am because of you .
O@@ r , people are not people without other people .
It &apos;s not a new idea or valu@@ e but it &apos;s one that I cer@@ tain@@ ly think at these times is wor@@ th buil@@ ding on .
In fact , it is said that in the col@@ lec@@ tive consci@@ ousness of Africa , we get to experience the de@@ e@@ p@@ est par@@ ts of our own human@@ ity through our interac@@ tions with others .
U@@ bun@@ t@@ u is at play right now .
You are h@@ ol@@ ding a space for me to expres@@ s the de@@ e@@ p@@ est tru@@ th of who I am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ out you , I &apos;m just a guy talking to an emp@@ ty room , and I sp@@ ent a lot of time last wee@@ k doing that , and it &apos;s not the same as this .
( Laughter ) If Man@@ dela was the national and inter@@ national em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment , then the man who ta@@ u@@ ght me the most about this valu@@ e person@@ ally was this man , S@@ ol@@ ly M@@ h@@ longo .
S@@ ol@@ ly was bor@@ n under a t@@ ree 60 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters from where I gre@@ w up in Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que .
He would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the ri@@ ch@@ est men I would ever me@@ et .
S@@ ol@@ ly gre@@ w up ten@@ ding to his fa@@ ther &apos;s ca@@ ttle .
Now , I can tell you , I don &apos;t know what it is about people who grow up looking after ca@@ ttle , but it makes for ü@@ ber@@ -@@ res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
The first job that he ever got in the sa@@ far@@ i bus@@ in@@ ess was fix@@ ing the sa@@ far@@ i tr@@ uc@@ ks .
Wh@@ ere he had learned to do that out in the bus@@ h I have no idea , but he could do it .
He then mo@@ ved across into what we called the hab@@ it@@ at te@@ am .
These were the people on the res@@ er@@ ve who were respon@@ sible for its w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being .
He fix@@ ed ro@@ ads , he men@@ ded we@@ t@@ lan@@ ds , he did some anti@@ -@@ po@@ ach@@ ing .
And then one day we were out together , and he came across the tra@@ c@@ ks of where a fe@@ mal@@ e le@@ o@@ par@@ d had wal@@ ked .
And it was an old tra@@ ck , but for f@@ un he tur@@ ned and he beg@@ an to fol@@ low it , and I tell you , I could tell by the spe@@ ed at which he mo@@ ved on those pa@@ d mar@@ ks that this man was a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .@@ -@@ level tra@@ c@@ ker .
If you dro@@ ve pa@@ st S@@ ol@@ ly some@@ where out on the res@@ er@@ ve , you look up in your re@@ ar@@ vie@@ w mir@@ ro@@ r , you &apos;d see he &apos;d st@@ op@@ ped the car 20 , 50 me@@ ters down the ro@@ ad just in case you need help with something .
The only ac@@ cu@@ sa@@ tion I ever heard le@@ ve@@ led at him was when one of our cli@@ ents said , &quot; S@@ ol@@ ly , you are path@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally hel@@ p@@ ful . &quot;
( Laughter ) When I started profes@@ sion@@ ally gu@@ i@@ ding people out into this environment , S@@ ol@@ ly was my tra@@ c@@ ker .
We worked together as a te@@ am .
And the first gu@@ est@@ s we ever got were a ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y gro@@ up from your E@@ ast Co@@ ast , and they said to S@@ ol@@ ly , on the side , they said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ fore we even go out to see li@@ ons and le@@ o@@ par@@ ds , we want to see where you live . &quot; &quot; So we took them up to his house , and this visi@@ t of the ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ist to his house co@@ inci@@ ded with a time when S@@ ol@@ ly &apos;s wi@@ fe , who was learning English , was going through a p@@ ha@@ se where she would open the do@@ or by saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ lo , I love you .
W@@ el@@ come , I love you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And there was something so beauti@@ ful@@ ly A@@ fri@@ can about it to me , this small house with a hu@@ ge heart in it .
Now on the day that S@@ ol@@ ly sa@@ ved my life , he was already my h@@ ero .
It was a ho@@ t day , and we found ourselves down by the ri@@ ver .
Because of the he@@ at , I took my sho@@ es off , and I ro@@ l@@ led up my pan@@ ts , and I wal@@ ked into the water .
S@@ ol@@ ly rema@@ in@@ ed on the b@@ ank .
The water was c@@ lear run@@ ning over s@@ and , and we tur@@ ned and we beg@@ an to make our way u@@ p@@ stre@@ am .
And a few me@@ ters a@@ head of us , there was a place where a t@@ ree had fal@@ l@@ en out of the b@@ ank , and its br@@ an@@ ches were tou@@ ching the water , and it was s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y .
And if had been a hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ e , people in the audi@@ ence would have started saying , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t go in there . D@@ on &apos;t go in there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And of course , the cro@@ co@@ di@@ le was in the s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws .
Now the first thing that you no@@ tice when a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le h@@ its you is the fer@@ o@@ city of the bi@@ te .
W@@ ha@@ m ! It h@@ its me by my right le@@ g .
It pul@@ ls me . It tur@@ ns . I th@@ row my hand up . I &apos;m able to gra@@ b a br@@ an@@ ch .
It &apos;s s@@ ha@@ king me viol@@ ently .
It &apos;s a very st@@ ran@@ ge sen@@ sa@@ tion having another cre@@ ature try and eat you , and there are few things that pro@@ m@@ ote ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an@@ ism like that .
( Laughter ) S@@ ol@@ ly on the b@@ ank se@@ es that I &apos;m in t@@ rou@@ ble .
He tur@@ ns . He beg@@ ins to make his way to me .
The cro@@ c again continu@@ es to s@@ ha@@ ke me .
It goes to bi@@ te me a second time .
I no@@ tice a sli@@ ck of blood in the water around me that gets was@@ h@@ ed do@@ w@@ n@@ stre@@ am .
As it b@@ it@@ es the second time , I k@@ ick .
My fo@@ o@@ t goes down its th@@ ro@@ at . It sp@@ its me out .
I pul@@ l myself up into the br@@ an@@ ches , and as I come out of the water , I look over my sh@@ oul@@ der .
My le@@ g from the k@@ ne@@ e down is man@@ g@@ led be@@ y@@ on@@ d descri@@ p@@ tion .
The b@@ one is cra@@ c@@ ked .
The me@@ at is tor@@ n up .
I make an inst@@ ant deci@@ sion that I &apos;ll never look at that again .
As I come out of the water , S@@ ol@@ ly ar@@ ri@@ ves at a de@@ ep sec@@ tion , a chan@@ ne@@ l between us .
He kno@@ ws , he se@@ es the sta@@ te of my le@@ g , he kno@@ ws that between him and I there is a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le , and I can tell you this man doesn &apos;t s@@ low down for one second .
He comes stra@@ ight into the chan@@ ne@@ l .
He wa@@ des in to ab@@ o@@ ve his wa@@ ist .
He gets to me . He gra@@ b@@ s me .
I &apos;m still in a vulner@@ able posi@@ tion .
He pic@@ ks me and pu@@ ts me on his sh@@ oul@@ der .
This is the other thing about S@@ ol@@ ly , he &apos;s f@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ is@@ h@@ ly st@@ rong .
He tur@@ ns . He wal@@ ks me up the b@@ ank .
He la@@ ys me down . He pul@@ ls his sh@@ ir@@ t off .
He w@@ ra@@ ps it around my le@@ g , pic@@ ks me up a second time , wal@@ ks me to a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
And I sur@@ vi@@ ve .
Now — ( Applause ) Now I don &apos;t know how many people you know that go into a de@@ ep chan@@ ne@@ l of water that they know has a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le in it to come and help you , but for S@@ ol@@ ly , it was as natural as bre@@ a@@ thing .
And he is one amazing example of what I have experi@@ en@@ ced all over Africa .
In a more col@@ lec@@ tive socie@@ ty , we realiz@@ e from the inside that our own w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly ti@@ ed to the w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being of others .
D@@ an@@ ger is shar@@ ed . P@@ a@@ in is shar@@ ed .
Jo@@ y is shar@@ ed . A@@ chi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment is shar@@ ed .
H@@ ou@@ ses are shar@@ ed . Fo@@ od is shar@@ ed .
U@@ bun@@ t@@ u as@@ ks us to open our hear@@ ts and to share , and what S@@ ol@@ ly ta@@ u@@ ght me that day is the es@@ sen@@ ce of this valu@@ e , his anima@@ ted , em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic ac@@ tion in every moment .
Now al@@ though the roo@@ t word is about people , I thought that maybe u@@ bun@@ t@@ u was only about people .
And then I me@@ t this young la@@ dy .
H@@ er name was E@@ l@@ v@@ is .
In fact , S@@ ol@@ ly ga@@ ve her the name E@@ l@@ v@@ is because he said she wal@@ ked like she was doing the E@@ l@@ v@@ is the pe@@ l@@ v@@ is d@@ ance .
She was bor@@ n with very b@@ ad@@ ly de@@ for@@ med back le@@ gs and pe@@ l@@ v@@ is .
She ar@@ ri@@ ved at our res@@ er@@ ve from a res@@ er@@ ve e@@ ast of us on her mi@@ gra@@ t@@ ory rou@@ te .
When I first saw her , I thought she would be de@@ ad in a matter of days .
And yet , for the next five years she re@@ tur@@ ned in the win@@ ter months .
And we would be so exci@@ ted to be out in the bus@@ h and to come across this un@@ us@@ u@@ al tra@@ ck .
It looked like an in@@ ver@@ ted bra@@ c@@ ket , and we would dro@@ p w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver we were doing and we would fol@@ low , and then we would come around the cor@@ ner , and there she would be with her her@@ d .
And that out@@ po@@ ur@@ ing of emo@@ tion from people on our sa@@ far@@ i tr@@ uc@@ ks as they saw her , it was this sense of kin@@ ship .
And it re@@ min@@ ded me that even people who grow up in ci@@ ties feel a natural connec@@ tion with the natural world and with animals .
And yet still I rema@@ in@@ ed ama@@ zed that she was sur@@ vi@@ ving .
And then one day we came across them at this small water ho@@ le .
It was sort of a h@@ ol@@ low in the ground .
And I wat@@ ched as the ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch d@@ ran@@ k , and then she tur@@ ned in that beautiful s@@ low mo@@ tion of ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts , loo@@ ks like the ar@@ m in mo@@ tion , and she beg@@ an to make her way up the ste@@ ep b@@ ank .
The res@@ t of the her@@ d tur@@ ned and beg@@ an to fol@@ low .
And I wat@@ ched young E@@ l@@ v@@ is beg@@ in to p@@ sy@@ ch her@@ self up for the h@@ ill .
She got visi@@ bly — ear@@ s came for@@ ward , she had a full go of it and hal@@ f@@ way up , her le@@ gs ga@@ ve way , and she f@@ ell bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
She at@@ temp@@ ted it a second time , and again , hal@@ f@@ way up , she f@@ ell bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
And on the th@@ ird at@@ temp@@ t , an amazing thing happened .
H@@ al@@ f@@ way up the b@@ ank , a young te@@ en@@ age ele@@ ph@@ ant came in be@@ hind her , and he pro@@ p@@ ped his tr@@ un@@ k under@@ ne@@ ath her , and he beg@@ an to sho@@ vel her up the b@@ ank .
And it oc@@ cur@@ red to me that the res@@ t of the her@@ d was in fact looking after this young ele@@ ph@@ ant .
The next day I wat@@ ched again as the ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch bro@@ ke a br@@ an@@ ch and she would put it in her m@@ outh , and then she would bre@@ ak a second one and dro@@ p it on the ground .
And a con@@ sen@@ su@@ s developed between all of us who were gu@@ i@@ ding people in that are@@ a that that her@@ d was in fact mo@@ ving s@@ lo@@ wer to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te that ele@@ ph@@ ant .
What E@@ l@@ v@@ is and the her@@ d ta@@ u@@ ght me ca@@ used me to ex@@ p@@ and my defini@@ tion of u@@ bun@@ t@@ u , and I believe that in the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the w@@ il@@ d , we get to see the most beautiful par@@ ts of ourselves ref@@ lec@@ ted back at us .
And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our human@@ ity but through all the cre@@ atur@@ es that live on this plan@@ et .
If Africa has a gi@@ ft to share , it &apos;s a gi@@ ft of a more col@@ lec@@ tive socie@@ ty .
And while it &apos;s true that u@@ bun@@ t@@ u is an A@@ fri@@ can idea , what I see is the es@@ sen@@ ce of that valu@@ e being in@@ ven@@ ted here .
Thank you .
( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So Bo@@ y@@ d , we know that you knew P@@ res@@ id@@ ent Man@@ dela from early chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and that you heard the news as we all did today , and de@@ e@@ p@@ ly dist@@ ra@@ u@@ ght and know the tra@@ gi@@ c lo@@ ss that it is to the world .
But I just wonder@@ ed if you wanted to share any ad@@ di@@ tional thou@@ ghts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this s@@ es@@ sion .
Bo@@ y@@ d V@@ ar@@ ty : Well th@@ an@@ ks , P@@ at .
I &apos;m so happ@@ y because it was time for him to pas@@ s on .
He was suf@@ fer@@ ing .
And so of course there &apos;s the mi@@ x@@ ed emo@@ tions .
But I just think of so many oc@@ cur@@ ren@@ ces like the time he went on the O@@ pra@@ h show and asked her what the show would be about .
( Laughter ) And she was like , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot; &quot; I mean , that &apos;s just incre@@ di@@ ble hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty . ( Laughter )
He was the fa@@ ther of our na@@ tion and we &apos;ve got a ro@@ ad to wal@@ k in S@@ outh Africa .
And everything , they used to call it M@@ adi@@ ba ma@@ gi@@ c .
You know , he used to go to a ru@@ g@@ by ma@@ t@@ ch and we would w@@ in .
An@@ y@@ where he went , things went well .
But I think that ma@@ gi@@ c will be with us , and the important thing is that we car@@ ry what he sto@@ od for .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to try and do , and that &apos;s what people all over S@@ outh Africa are trying to do .
P@@ M : And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . B@@ V : Oh , th@@ ank you .
P@@ M : Thank you . B@@ V : Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
( Music ) For any of you who have visi@@ ted or li@@ ved in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity , these sh@@ ots might start to look famili@@ ar .
This is C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ k , one of the most beauti@@ ful@@ ly desig@@ ned publi@@ c sp@@ aces in America .
But to any@@ one who ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t visi@@ ted , these imag@@ es can &apos;t really ful@@ ly con@@ ve@@ y .
To really understand C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ k , you have to physi@@ cally be there .
Well , the same is true of the music , which my bro@@ ther and I com@@ pos@@ ed and ma@@ p@@ ped speci@@ fi@@ cally for C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ k .
( Music ) I &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my bro@@ ther Ha@@ ys and I are doing — That &apos;s us there . That &apos;s both of us actually — speci@@ fi@@ cally about a concep@@ t that we &apos;ve been develo@@ ping over the last few years , this idea of lo@@ ca@@ tion@@ -@@ aw@@ are music .
Now , my bro@@ ther and I , we &apos;re mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and music produc@@ ers .
We &apos;ve been working together sin@@ ce , well , sin@@ ce we were kids , really .
But rec@@ ently , we &apos;ve become more and more interes@@ ted in pro@@ jects where art and technology inter@@ sec@@ t , from cre@@ ating si@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ speci@@ fic audi@@ o and video inst@@ al@@ lation to eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing interac@@ tive con@@ cer@@ ts .
But today I want to fo@@ c@@ us on this concep@@ t of com@@ posi@@ tion for physical space .
But before I go too much f@@ ur@@ ther into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
My bro@@ ther and I were living in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity when the arti@@ sts Ch@@ ris@@ to and J@@ e@@ an@@ ne@@ -@@ C@@ la@@ u@@ de did their tem@@ por@@ ary inst@@ al@@ lation , The G@@ ates , in C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ k .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of these bri@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ red s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures de@@ co@@ ra@@ ted the par@@ k for a number of wee@@ ks , and un@@ like work that &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted in a more neu@@ tra@@ l space , like on the wal@@ ls of a gal@@ ler@@ y or a mu@@ se@@ um , this was work that was really in di@@ al@@ o@@ gue with this place , and in a lot of ways , The G@@ ates was really a ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tion of F@@ re@@ der@@ ick O@@ l@@ m@@ s@@ ted &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble desig@@ n .
This was an experience that sta@@ y@@ ed with us for a long time , and years later , my bro@@ ther and I mo@@ ved back to W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , and we started to ask the question , would it be possible , in the same way that The G@@ ates respon@@ ded to the physical la@@ y@@ out of the par@@ k , to com@@ pos@@ e music for a lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe ?
Wh@@ ich b@@ rou@@ ght us to this .
( Music ) O@@ n M@@ e@@ mor@@ ial D@@ ay , we re@@ lea@@ sed &quot; &quot; The Na@@ tional M@@ all , &quot; &quot; a lo@@ ca@@ tion@@ -@@ aw@@ are al@@ bu@@ m re@@ lea@@ sed ex@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ vely as a mo@@ bi@@ le ap@@ p that us@@ es the devi@@ ce &apos;s buil@@ t@@ -@@ in G@@ P@@ S func@@ tion@@ ality to son@@ ic@@ ally ma@@ p the entire par@@ k in our ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mu@@ si@@ cal se@@ g@@ ments are ge@@ o@@ -@@ ta@@ gg@@ ed throu@@ gh@@ out the entire par@@ k so that as a listen@@ er tra@@ ver@@ ses the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe , a mu@@ si@@ cal s@@ co@@ re is actually un@@ fol@@ ding around them .
So this is not a play@@ li@@ st or a li@@ st of son@@ gs inten@@ ded for the par@@ k , but ra@@ ther an arra@@ y of dist@@ inc@@ t me@@ lo@@ dies and r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms that f@@ it together like pi@@ eces of a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le and b@@ l@@ end se@@ am@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly based on a listen@@ er &apos;s cho@@ sen tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory .
So think of this as a ch@@ oo@@ se@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ -@@ ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure of an al@@ bu@@ m .
Let &apos;s take a clo@@ ser look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
So using the ap@@ p , as you make your way to@@ war@@ ds the gro@@ unds sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton M@@ on@@ u@@ ment , you he@@ ar the so@@ unds of instru@@ ments war@@ ming up , which then gi@@ ves way to the sound of a mell@@ ot@@ ron spe@@ lling out a very simple me@@ lo@@ dy .
This is then jo@@ in@@ ed by the sound of s@@ wee@@ ping viol@@ ins .
K@@ e@@ ep wal@@ king , and a full cho@@ ir jo@@ ins in , until you finally re@@ ach the top of the h@@ ill and you &apos;re hear@@ ing the sound of dru@@ ms and fi@@ re@@ works and all sor@@ ts of mu@@ si@@ cal cra@@ z@@ in@@ ess , as if all of these so@@ unds are radi@@ ating out from this gi@@ ant o@@ beli@@ s@@ k that pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ates the cen@@ ter of the par@@ k .
But were you to wal@@ k in the op@@ posi@@ te direc@@ tion , this entire se@@ qu@@ ence happens in re@@ ver@@ se .
And were you to actually ex@@ it the peri@@ me@@ ter of the par@@ k , the music would fa@@ de to si@@ l@@ ence , and the play bu@@ tt@@ on would disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
We &apos;re sometimes con@@ tac@@ ted by people in other par@@ ts of the world who can &apos;t tra@@ vel to the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , but would like to he@@ ar this recor@@ d .
Well , un@@ like a normal al@@ bu@@ m , we ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te this re@@ qu@@ est .
When they ask for a C@@ .@@ D@@ . or an M@@ P@@ 3 ver@@ sion , we just can &apos;t make that happen , and the reason is because this isn &apos;t a pro@@ mo@@ tional ap@@ p or a game to pro@@ m@@ ote or ac@@ comp@@ any the re@@ le@@ ase of a tradi@@ tional recor@@ d .
In this case , the ap@@ p is the work it@@ self , and the ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture of the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe is in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic to the listen@@ ing experience .
S@@ i@@ x months later , we did a lo@@ ca@@ tion@@ -@@ aw@@ are al@@ bu@@ m for C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ k , a par@@ k that is over two times the size of the Na@@ tional M@@ all , with music sp@@ an@@ ning from the S@@ he@@ ep &apos;s M@@ e@@ ado@@ w to the R@@ am@@ ble to the R@@ es@@ er@@ vo@@ ir .
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently , my bro@@ ther and I are working on pro@@ jects all over the country , but last s@@ pr@@ ing we started a project , here actually at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d &apos;s Ex@@ peri@@ mental M@@ edi@@ a Ar@@ t De@@ par@@ t@@ ment , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating our lar@@ g@@ est lo@@ ca@@ tion@@ -@@ aw@@ are al@@ bu@@ m to da@@ te , one that will sp@@ an the enti@@ re@@ ty of H@@ i@@ gh@@ way 1 here on the P@@ a@@ ci@@ fic Co@@ ast .
But what we &apos;re doing , inte@@ gra@@ ting G@@ P@@ S with music , is really just one idea .
But it spe@@ a@@ ks to a lar@@ ger vi@@ sion for a music indu@@ stry that &apos;s sometimes stru@@ gg@@ led to find its fo@@ ot@@ ing in this di@@ gi@@ tal age , that they beg@@ in to see these new technolo@@ gi@@ es not simply as ways of ad@@ ding be@@ lls and wh@@ ist@@ les to an exist@@ ing mode@@ l , but to dre@@ am up enti@@ re@@ ly new ways for people to interac@@ t with and experience music .
Thank you .

I want you to imagine this for a moment .
And an especi@@ ally important ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge that I &apos;ve had to face is the great sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of mental health profes@@ sion@@ als , such as p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in the develo@@ ping world .
E@@ ri@@ c B@@ er@@ low : I &apos;m an eco@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , and Se@@ an &apos;s a physi@@ ci@@ st , and we both study comple@@ x ne@@ t@@ works .
And we me@@ t a cou@@ ple years ago when we disco@@ vered that we had both given a sh@@ or@@ t TED Tal@@ k about the eco@@ logy of w@@ ar , and we realiz@@ ed that we were connec@@ ted by the ideas we shar@@ ed before we ever me@@ t .
And then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other tal@@ ks out there , especi@@ ally TE@@ D@@ x Tal@@ ks , that are po@@ p@@ ping up all over the world .
How are they connec@@ ted , and what does that global conversa@@ tion look like ?
So Se@@ an &apos;s going to tell you a little bit about how we did that .
Se@@ an G@@ our@@ le@@ y : Ex@@ ac@@ tly . So we took 2@@ 4@@ ,000 TE@@ D@@ x Tal@@ ks from around the world , 1@@ 4@@ 7 different countries , and we took these tal@@ ks and we wanted to find the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ tures that under@@ ly the ideas be@@ hind them .
And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connec@@ ted with each other .
And so , of course , if you &apos;re going to do this kind of stuff , you need a lot of data .
So the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be , and we can go down and basi@@ cally pul@@ l all the open information from Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be , all the com@@ ments , all the vie@@ ws , who &apos;s wat@@ ching it , where are they wat@@ ching it , what are they saying in the com@@ ments .
But we can also pul@@ l up , using spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ text trans@@ lation , we can pul@@ l the entire trans@@ cri@@ pt , and that works even for people with kind of fun@@ ny ac@@ c@@ ents like myself .
So we can take their trans@@ cri@@ pt and actually do some pretty co@@ ol things .
We can take natural language pro@@ ces@@ sing alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extra@@ c@@ ting k@@ ey concep@@ ts from this .
And we take those k@@ ey concep@@ ts and they sort of form this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture of an idea .
And we call that the me@@ me@@ -@@ o@@ me .
And the me@@ me@@ -@@ o@@ me , you know , quite simply , is the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics that under@@ li@@ es an idea , and we can do some pretty interesting anal@@ y@@ sis with it , which I want to share with you now .
So each idea has its own me@@ me@@ -@@ o@@ me , and each idea is uni@@ que with that , but of course , ideas , they bor@@ row from each other , they kind of ste@@ al sometimes , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly build on each other , and we can go through ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and take the me@@ me@@ -@@ o@@ me from one talk and compar@@ e it to the me@@ me@@ -@@ o@@ me from every other talk , and if there &apos;s a simi@@ lar@@ ity between the two of them , we can create a lin@@ k and repres@@ ent that as a gra@@ p@@ h , just like E@@ ri@@ c and I are connec@@ ted .
So that &apos;s the@@ ory , that &apos;s great .
Let &apos;s see how it works in actual prac@@ tice .
So what we &apos;ve got here now is the global fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int of all the TE@@ D@@ x Tal@@ ks over the last four years ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ding out around the world from Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k all the way down to little old Ne@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in the cor@@ ner .
And what we did on this is we anal@@ y@@ zed the top 25 percent of these , and we started to see where the connec@@ tions oc@@ cur@@ red , where they connec@@ ted with each other .
C@@ a@@ mer@@ on R@@ us@@ se@@ ll talking about ima@@ ge and be@@ au@@ ty connec@@ ted over into Europe .
We &apos;ve got a bi@@ gg@@ er conversa@@ tion about Isra@@ el and P@@ al@@ est@@ ine radi@@ ating ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ ds from the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast .
And we &apos;ve got something a little bro@@ ad@@ er like big data with a tru@@ ly global fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int re@@ min@@ is@@ cent of a conversa@@ tion that is happen@@ ing every@@ where .
So from this , we kind of r@@ un up aga@@ in@@ st the limi@@ ts of what we can actually do with a ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c pro@@ jec@@ tion , but l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , computer technology al@@ lo@@ ws us to go out into multi@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al space .
So we can take in our ne@@ t@@ work pro@@ jec@@ tion and ap@@ p@@ ly a physi@@ cs eng@@ ine to this , and the similar tal@@ ks kind of s@@ ma@@ sh together , and the different ones f@@ ly a@@ part , and what we &apos;re left with is something quite beautiful .
E@@ B : So I want to just point out here that every no@@ de is a talk , they &apos;re lin@@ ked if they share similar ideas , and that comes from a mach@@ ine read@@ ing of entire talk trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts , and then all these to@@ pic@@ s that po@@ p out , they &apos;re not from ta@@ gs and ke@@ y@@ words .
They come from the ne@@ t@@ work struc@@ ture of inter@@ connec@@ ted ideas . K@@ e@@ ep going .
S@@ G : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . So I got a little qu@@ ick on that , but he &apos;s going to s@@ low me down .
We &apos;ve got education connec@@ ted to stor@@ y@@ telling tri@@ an@@ gu@@ la@@ ted next to social media .
You &apos;ve got , of course , the human brain right next to health@@ care , which you might expec@@ t , but also you &apos;ve got video games , which is sort of ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent , as those two sp@@ aces inter@@ face with each other .
But I want to take you into one cl@@ us@@ ter that &apos;s partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly important to me , and that &apos;s the environment .
And I want to kind of z@@ oo@@ m in on that and see if we can get a little more res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
So as we go in here , what we start to see , ap@@ p@@ ly the physi@@ cs eng@@ ine again , we see what &apos;s one conversa@@ tion is actually com@@ pos@@ ed of many s@@ mal@@ ler ones .
The struc@@ ture star@@ ts to emer@@ ge where we see a kind of f@@ rac@@ tal behavi@@ or of the words and the language that we use to descri@@ be the things that are important to us all around this world .
So you &apos;ve got food econo@@ my and lo@@ cal food at the top , you &apos;ve got gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases , solar and nuc@@ lear was@@ te .
What you &apos;re getting is a ran@@ ge of s@@ mal@@ ler conversa@@ tions , each connec@@ ted to each other through the ideas and the language they share , cre@@ ating a bro@@ ad@@ er concep@@ t of the environment .
And of course , from here , we can go and z@@ oo@@ m in and see , well , what are young people looking at ?
And they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuc@@ lear fu@@ sion .
This is their kind of res@@ on@@ ance for the conversa@@ tion around the environment .
If we sp@@ li@@ t al@@ ong gen@@ der lin@@ es , we can see fe@@ mal@@ es res@@ on@@ ating he@@ avi@@ ly with food econo@@ my , but also out there in hope and op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
And so there &apos;s a lot of exci@@ ting stuff we can do here , and I &apos;ll th@@ row to E@@ ri@@ c for the next part .
E@@ B : Y@@ e@@ ah , I mean , just to point out here , you cannot get this kind of per@@ spec@@ tive from a simple ta@@ g se@@ ar@@ ch on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be .
Let &apos;s now z@@ oo@@ m back out to the entire global conversa@@ tion out of environment , and look at all the tal@@ ks together .
Now of@@ ten , when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with this amount of cont@@ ent , we do a cou@@ ple of things to simp@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
We might just say , well , what are the most popu@@ lar tal@@ ks out there ?
And a few ri@@ se to the sur@@ face .
There &apos;s a talk about gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de .
There &apos;s another one about person@@ al health and nu@@ tri@@ tion .
And of course , there &apos;s got to be one about por@@ n , right ?
And so then we might say , well , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , that was last year .
What &apos;s tr@@ en@@ ding now ? What &apos;s the popu@@ lar talk now ?
And we can see that the new , emer@@ ging , top tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pi@@ c is about di@@ gi@@ tal pri@@ vac@@ y .
So this is great . It simp@@ li@@ fi@@ es things .
But there &apos;s so much crea@@ tive cont@@ ent that &apos;s just bu@@ ri@@ ed at the bot@@ to@@ m .
And I ha@@ te that . How do we bu@@ b@@ ble stuff up to the sur@@ face that &apos;s maybe really crea@@ tive and interesting ?
Well , we can go back to the ne@@ t@@ work struc@@ ture of ideas to do that .
Re@@ member , it &apos;s that ne@@ t@@ work struc@@ ture that is cre@@ ating these emer@@ g@@ ent to@@ pic@@ s , and let &apos;s say we could take two of them , like ci@@ ties and gene@@ tics , and say , well , are there any tal@@ ks that crea@@ tively bri@@ dge these two really different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ es .
And that &apos;s — Es@@ senti@@ ally , this kind of crea@@ tive re@@ mi@@ x is one of the hall@@ mar@@ ks of in@@ no@@ va@@ tion .
Well here &apos;s one by J@@ es@@ sica Gre@@ en about the micro@@ bi@@ al eco@@ logy of buil@@ d@@ ings .
It &apos;s liter@@ ally defin@@ ing a new fiel@@ d .
And we could go back to those to@@ pic@@ s and say , well , what tal@@ ks are cent@@ ral to those conversa@@ tions ?
In the ci@@ ties cl@@ us@@ ter , one of the most cent@@ ral was one by M@@ it@@ ch Jo@@ ac@@ him about eco@@ logical ci@@ ties , and in the gene@@ tics cl@@ us@@ ter , we have a talk about sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic bio@@ logy by C@@ rai@@ g V@@ en@@ ter .
These are tal@@ ks that are lin@@ king many tal@@ ks within their dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine .
We could go the other direc@@ tion and say , well , what are tal@@ ks that are bro@@ ad@@ ly sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ zing a lot of different kinds of fiel@@ ds .
We used a meas@@ ure of eco@@ logical diversi@@ ty to get this .
Li@@ ke , a talk by Ste@@ ven P@@ in@@ ker on the hist@@ ory of viol@@ ence , very sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic .
And then , of course , there are tal@@ ks that are so uni@@ que they &apos;re kind of out in the stra@@ to@@ s@@ ph@@ ere , in their own spe@@ cial place , and we call that the C@@ ol@@ le@@ en F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an in@@ de@@ x .
And if you don &apos;t know C@@ ol@@ le@@ en , she &apos;s an arti@@ st , and I asked her , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s it like out there in the stra@@ to@@ s@@ ph@@ ere of our idea space ? &quot; &quot; And ap@@ par@@ ently it s@@ mell@@ s like ba@@ con .
I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t know .
So we &apos;re using these ne@@ t@@ work mo@@ ti@@ f@@ s to find tal@@ ks that are uni@@ que , ones that are crea@@ tively sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ zing a lot of different fiel@@ ds , ones that are cent@@ ral to their to@@ pi@@ c , and ones that are really crea@@ tively bri@@ d@@ ging dis@@ par@@ ate fiel@@ ds .
Okay ? We never would have found those with our ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with what &apos;s tr@@ en@@ ding now .
And all of this comes from the ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture of comple@@ x@@ ity , or the pa@@ tter@@ ns of how things are connec@@ ted .
S@@ G : So that &apos;s exactly right .
We &apos;ve got ourselves in a world that &apos;s mas@@ si@@ vely comple@@ x , and we &apos;ve been using alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms to kind of fil@@ ter it down so we can na@@ vi@@ ga@@ te through it .
And those alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , wh@@ il@@ st being kind of u@@ se@@ ful , are also very , very n@@ ar@@ row , and we can do better than that , because we can realiz@@ e that their comple@@ x@@ ity is not ran@@ dom .
It has ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture , and we can use that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture to go and ex@@ pl@@ ore things like the world of ideas to see what &apos;s being said , to see what &apos;s not being said , and to be a little bit more human and , ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly , a little s@@ mar@@ ter .
Thank you .

I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
The question is , Why is it that the le@@ tter X repres@@ ents the un@@ kno@@ wn ?
Now I know we learned that in ma@@ th cla@@ ss , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , Pro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x .
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , which tur@@ ns out to be a su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly logical language .
To wri@@ te a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a s@@ ent@@ ence in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c is like cra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ me@@ ly preci@@ se and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information .
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ est@@ er@@ n science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing was really worked out in the first few cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es of the Co@@ m@@ mon Era by the Per@@ si@@ ans and the A@@ ra@@ b@@ s and the Tur@@ ks .
This inclu@@ des the little system in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c called al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ br@@ a .
And al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r rou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ la@@ tes to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ ci@@ ling dis@@ par@@ ate par@@ ts . &quot;
Al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r finally came into English as al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
One example a@@ mon@@ g many .
The A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c tex@@ ts con@@ tain@@ ing this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical wis@@ dom finally made their way to Europe — which is to say S@@ pa@@ in — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es .
And when they ar@@ ri@@ ved there was tre@@ men@@ dous inter@@ est in trans@@ la@@ ting this wis@@ dom into a Euro@@ pe@@ an language .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some so@@ unds in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c that just don &apos;t make it through a Euro@@ pe@@ an vo@@ ice bo@@ x without l@@ ots of prac@@ tice .
T@@ r@@ ust me on that one .
Al@@ so , those very so@@ unds ten@@ d not to be repres@@ en@@ ted by the char@@ ac@@ ters that are a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble in Euro@@ pe@@ an langu@@ ages .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pri@@ ts .
This is the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first le@@ tter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ kno@@ wn thing .
Now in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , we can make this defini@@ te by ad@@ ding the defini@@ te ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ kno@@ wn thing .
And this is a word that ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 10@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y der@@ i@@ va@@ tion of pro@@ of@@ s .
The problem for the M@@ edi@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ is@@ h sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s who were tas@@ ked with trans@@ la@@ ting this material is that the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ is@@ h because S@@ pan@@ is@@ h doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound .
So by conven@@ tion , they cre@@ ated a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ w@@ ed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the cla@@ s@@ si@@ cal G@@ ree@@ k in the form of the le@@ tter K@@ a@@ i .
L@@ ater when this material was trans@@ la@@ ted into a common Euro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say L@@ a@@ ti@@ n , they simply re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed the G@@ ree@@ k K@@ a@@ i with the L@@ a@@ ti@@ n X@@ .
And on@@ ce that happened , on@@ ce this material was in L@@ a@@ ti@@ n , it for@@ med the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics tex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ kno@@ wn ? X is the un@@ kno@@ wn
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ is@@ h .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th shar@@ ing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter w@@ ha@@ t@@ so@@ ever .
Then she se@@ es the other one getting gra@@ pe , and you will see what happens .
S@@ even years ago , a stud@@ ent came to me and asked me to inv@@ est in his comp@@ any .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working with three fri@@ ends , and we &apos;re going to try to dis@@ ru@@ pt an indu@@ stry by se@@ lling stuff on@@ line . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you gu@@ ys sp@@ ent the whole su@@ mm@@ er on this , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No , we all took inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps just in case it doesn &apos;t work out . &quot;
&quot; All right , but you &apos;re going to go in full time on@@ ce you gra@@ du@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; No@@ t exactly . We &apos;ve all lin@@ ed up bac@@ k@@ up j@@ ob@@ s . &quot;
S@@ i@@ x months go by , it &apos;s the day before the comp@@ any la@@ un@@ ches , and there is still not a func@@ tion@@ ing we@@ b@@ si@@ te .
And they en@@ ded up na@@ ming the comp@@ any W@@ ar@@ by Par@@ ker .
( Laughter ) They se@@ ll g@@ la@@ s@@ ses on@@ line .
They were rec@@ ently recogni@@ zed as the world &apos;s most in@@ no@@ va@@ tive comp@@ any and valu@@ ed at over a billion dollars .
Why was I so wrong ?
To find out , I &apos;ve been stud@@ ying people that I come to call &quot; &quot; ori@@ g@@ in@@ als . &quot; &quot; O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ als are n@@ on@@ con@@ for@@ mi@@ sts , people who not only have new ideas but take ac@@ tion to cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on them .
They are people who st@@ and out and spe@@ ak up .
O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ als dri@@ ve crea@@ tivi@@ ty and change in the world .
They &apos;re the people you want to be@@ t on .
And they look nothing like I expec@@ ted .
I want to show you today three things I &apos;ve learned about recogni@@ zing ori@@ g@@ in@@ als and be@@ coming a little bit more like them .
So the first reason that I pas@@ sed on W@@ ar@@ by Par@@ ker was they were really s@@ low getting off the ground .
Now , you are all in@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely famili@@ ar with the mind of a pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ or .
Well , I have a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion for you . I &apos;m the op@@ posi@@ te . I &apos;m a pre@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ or .
Y@@ es , that &apos;s an actual ter@@ m .
I just feel that a few months a@@ head of time .
( Laughter ) So this started early : when I was a kid , I took N@@ inten@@ do games very seri@@ ously .
I would wa@@ ke up at 5@@ am , start pla@@ ying and not stop until I had ma@@ ster@@ ed them .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ ally it got so out of hand that a lo@@ cal ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per came and did a story on the dar@@ k side of N@@ inten@@ do , star@@ r@@ ing me .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) S@@ in@@ ce then , I have tra@@ ded ha@@ ir for te@@ e@@ th . ( Laughter )
But this ser@@ ved me well in colle@@ ge , because I fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed my sen@@ i@@ or th@@ esis four months before the de@@ ad@@ line .
And I was pro@@ u@@ d of that , until a few years ago .
I had a stud@@ ent na@@ med J@@ i@@ ha@@ e , who came to me and said , &quot; I have my most crea@@ tive ideas when I &apos;m pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating . &quot;
So I ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ed her to get some data .
She goes into a bun@@ ch of comp@@ ani@@ es .
Then she gets their bo@@ s@@ ses to rate how crea@@ tive and in@@ no@@ va@@ tive they are .
And sure enough , the pre@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors like me , who r@@ us@@ h in and do everything early are ra@@ ted as less crea@@ tive than people who pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ate moder@@ ately .
So I want to know what happens to the ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ c pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
She was like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . They didn &apos;t fi@@ ll out my sur@@ ve@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No , here are our resul@@ ts .
You actually do see that the people who wa@@ it until the last minu@@ te are so bus@@ y go@@ of@@ ing off that they don &apos;t have any new ideas .
And on the fli@@ p side , the people who race in are in such a f@@ ren@@ z@@ y of an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty that they don &apos;t have ori@@ g@@ in@@ al thou@@ ghts ei@@ ther .
There &apos;s a s@@ we@@ et s@@ po@@ t where ori@@ g@@ in@@ als see@@ m to live .
Why is this ?
To find out , we desig@@ ned some experi@@ ments .
And some of them are asked to do the tas@@ k right away .
And sure enough , the moder@@ ate pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors are 1@@ 6 percent more crea@@ tive than the other two g@@ rou@@ ps .
( Laughter ) And then I worked di@@ li@@ g@@ ently to@@ ward my go@@ al of not making pro@@ g@@ ress to@@ ward my go@@ al .
It was ag@@ ony .
But when I came back to it , I had all sor@@ ts of new ideas .
As A@@ aron S@@ or@@ k@@ in put it , &quot; You call it pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating . I call it thinking . &quot;
And al@@ ong the way I disco@@ vered that a lot of great ori@@ g@@ in@@ als in hist@@ ory were pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
Ta@@ ke Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da V@@ inc@@ i .
He to@@ i@@ led on and off for 1@@ 6 years on the M@@ on@@ a L@@ is@@ a .
He fel@@ t like a fa@@ il@@ ure .
He w@@ r@@ ote as much in his j@@ our@@ n@@ al .
But some of the diversi@@ ons he took in op@@ tics trans@@ for@@ med the way that he mode@@ led light and made him into a much better pa@@ in@@ ter .
He &apos;s si@@ tting in the audi@@ ence wa@@ it@@ ing for his turn to go on@@ sta@@ ge , and he is still s@@ cri@@ b@@ b@@ ling n@@ ot@@ es and cro@@ s@@ sing out lin@@ es .
That was not in the s@@ cri@@ pt .
B@@ y de@@ la@@ ying the tas@@ k of fin@@ aliz@@ ing the spe@@ ec@@ h until the very last minu@@ te , he left hi@@ m@@ self open to the wi@@ des@@ t ran@@ ge of possible ideas .
And because the text was@@ n &apos;t set in st@@ one , he had f@@ ree@@ dom to impro@@ vi@@ se .
Pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating is a vi@@ ce when it comes to produc@@ tivi@@ ty , but it can be a vir@@ tu@@ e for crea@@ tivi@@ ty .
What you see with a lot of great ori@@ g@@ in@@ als is that they are qu@@ ick to start but they &apos;re s@@ low to fin@@ is@@ h .
And this is what I mis@@ sed with W@@ ar@@ by Par@@ ker .
What you see is that the first mo@@ ver@@ s had a fa@@ il@@ ure rate of 4@@ 7 percent , compar@@ ed with only 8 percent for the impro@@ ver@@ s .
L@@ oo@@ k at F@@ ace@@ book , wa@@ it@@ ing to build a social ne@@ t@@ work until after M@@ y@@ space and F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s@@ ter .
L@@ oo@@ k at Goog@@ le , wa@@ it@@ ing for years after Al@@ ta@@ vista and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
It &apos;s much e@@ asi@@ er to impro@@ ve on somebody else &apos;s idea than it is to create something new from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch .
So the l@@ es@@ son I learned is that to be ori@@ g@@ in@@ al you don &apos;t have to be first .
You just have to be different and better .
They had bac@@ k@@ up pl@@ ans lin@@ ed up , and that made me dou@@ b@@ t that they had the cou@@ ra@@ ge to be ori@@ g@@ in@@ al , because I expec@@ ted that ori@@ g@@ in@@ als would look something like this .
And so the k@@ ey to being ori@@ g@@ in@@ al is just a simple thing of a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding the lea@@ p from ste@@ p three to ste@@ p four .
Well , there &apos;s a c@@ lue , it tur@@ ns out , in the Internet bro@@ w@@ ser that you use .
Y@@ es .
Why ? It &apos;s not a tech@@ ni@@ cal ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge .
The four bro@@ w@@ ser g@@ rou@@ ps on a@@ ver@@ age have similar ty@@ ping spe@@ ed and they also have similar lev@@ els of computer kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge .
It &apos;s about how you got the bro@@ w@@ ser .
Because if you use Internet Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ rer or S@@ af@@ ar@@ i , those came pre@@ inst@@ al@@ led on your computer , and you ac@@ cep@@ ted the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t op@@ tion that was han@@ ded to you .
So people he@@ ar about this study and they &apos;re like , &quot; Gre@@ at , if I want to get better at my job , I just need to u@@ p@@ gra@@ de my bro@@ w@@ ser ? &quot;
And if you do that well , you will open yourself up to the op@@ posi@@ te of dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u .
There &apos;s a name for it . It &apos;s called v@@ u@@ j@@ a de .
( Laughter ) V@@ u@@ j@@ a de is when you look at something you &apos;ve seen many times before and all of a su@@ d@@ den see it with f@@ res@@ h eyes .
It &apos;s a s@@ cre@@ en@@ wri@@ ter who loo@@ ks at a mo@@ vi@@ e s@@ cri@@ pt that can &apos;t get the green light for more than half a cent@@ ur@@ y .
In every pa@@ st ver@@ sion , the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter has been an evi@@ l que@@ en .
But J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Le@@ e star@@ ts to question whether that makes sense .
So there &apos;s a simple mes@@ sa@@ ge from this story .
When you feel dou@@ b@@ t , don &apos;t let it go .
( Laughter ) What about fe@@ ar ?
O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ als feel fe@@ ar , too .
They &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id of fa@@ il@@ ing , but what se@@ ts them a@@ part from the res@@ t of us is that they &apos;re even more af@@ ra@@ id of fa@@ il@@ ing to try .
They know you can fa@@ il by star@@ ting a bus@@ in@@ ess that goes ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt or by fa@@ il@@ ing to start a bus@@ in@@ ess at all .
They know that in the long r@@ un , our bi@@ gg@@ est re@@ gre@@ ts are not our ac@@ tions but our in@@ ac@@ tions .
E@@ l@@ on M@@ us@@ k told me rec@@ ently , he didn &apos;t expec@@ t T@@ es@@ la to suc@@ ce@@ ed .
But I have some good news for you .
You are not going to get j@@ ud@@ ged on your bad ideas .
A lot of people think they will .
They were af@@ ra@@ id of e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ sing themselves , of looking stu@@ pi@@ d .
But gu@@ ess what ? O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ als have l@@ ots and l@@ ots of bad ideas , t@@ ons of them , in fact .
Ta@@ ke the guy who in@@ ven@@ ted this .
No . You ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te Th@@ o@@ mas E@@ di@@ son for pi@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ing the light bul@@ b .
( Laughter ) If you look across fiel@@ ds , the gre@@ at@@ est ori@@ g@@ in@@ als are the ones who fa@@ il the most , because they &apos;re the ones who try the most .
Ta@@ ke cla@@ s@@ si@@ cal com@@ pos@@ ers , the best of the best .
Why do some of them get more pa@@ ges in en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedi@@ as than others and also have their com@@ posi@@ tions r@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded more times ?
The more out@@ put you ch@@ ur@@ n out , the more vari@@ e@@ ty you get and the better your chan@@ ces of stu@@ mb@@ ling on something tru@@ ly ori@@ g@@ in@@ al .
E@@ ven the three i@@ con@@ s of cla@@ s@@ si@@ cal music — B@@ ach , Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven , Mo@@ z@@ art — had to gener@@ ate hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of com@@ posi@@ tions to come up with a much s@@ mal@@ ler number of ma@@ ster@@ pi@@ eces .
Now , you may be wonder@@ ing , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
I don &apos;t know how W@@ ag@@ ner pul@@ led that off .
So if you put all this together , what you see is that ori@@ g@@ in@@ als are not that different from the res@@ t of us .
They feel fe@@ ar and dou@@ b@@ t . They pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
They have bad ideas .
And sometimes , it &apos;s not in spi@@ te of those qu@@ ali@@ ties but because of them that they suc@@ ce@@ ed .
D@@ on &apos;t wri@@ te them off .
And when that &apos;s you , don &apos;t coun@@ t yourself out ei@@ ther .
L@@ oo@@ k , being ori@@ g@@ in@@ al is not e@@ as@@ y , but I have no dou@@ b@@ t about this : it &apos;s the best way to impro@@ ve the world around us .
Thank you .

In the year 19@@ 0@@ 1 , a woman called Au@@ g@@ us@@ te was ta@@ ken to a medical as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in Fran@@ k@@ f@@ ur@@ t .
Au@@ g@@ us@@ te was de@@ lu@@ sion@@ al and coul@@ dn &apos;t remember even the most ba@@ sic de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of her life .
H@@ er doc@@ tor was called A@@ lo@@ is .
A@@ lo@@ is didn &apos;t know how to help Au@@ g@@ us@@ te , but he wat@@ ched over her until , sa@@ d@@ ly , she pas@@ sed away in 19@@ 0@@ 6 .
Af@@ ter she died , A@@ lo@@ is per@@ for@@ med an auto@@ p@@ s@@ y and found st@@ ran@@ ge pla@@ qu@@ es and tan@@ g@@ les in Au@@ g@@ us@@ te &apos;s brain — the li@@ kes of which he &apos;d never seen before .
Now here &apos;s the even more stri@@ king thing .
If Au@@ g@@ us@@ te had instead been ali@@ ve today , we could of@@ fer her no more help than A@@ lo@@ is was able to 1@@ 1@@ 4 years ago .
A@@ lo@@ is was D@@ r. A@@ lo@@ is Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer .
S@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 0@@ 1 , medic@@ ine has ad@@ van@@ ced gre@@ at@@ ly .
We &apos;ve disco@@ vered antibio@@ tics and vac@@ cin@@ es to protec@@ t us from infec@@ tions , many tre@@ at@@ ments for cancer , anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ als for H@@ I@@ V , sta@@ t@@ ins for heart disease and much more .
But we &apos;ve made es@@ senti@@ ally no pro@@ g@@ ress at all in tre@@ ating Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s disease .
I &apos;m part of a te@@ am of scienti@@ sts who has been working to find a cur@@ e for Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s for over a deca@@ de .
Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s now af@@ fec@@ ts 40 million people wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
But by 20@@ 50 , it will af@@ fec@@ t 1@@ 50 million people — which , by the way , will inclu@@ de many of you .
If you &apos;re ho@@ ping to live to be 8@@ 5 or ol@@ der , your chan@@ ce of getting Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s will be almost one in two .
In other words , o@@ d@@ ds are you &apos;ll s@@ pen@@ d your g@@ ol@@ den years ei@@ ther suf@@ fer@@ ing from Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s or hel@@ ping to look after a fri@@ end or lo@@ ved one with Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s .
One out of every five M@@ edi@@ care dollars get sp@@ ent on Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s .
It may sur@@ pri@@ se you that , put simply , Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s is one of the bi@@ gg@@ est medical and social ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es of our gener@@ ation .
But we &apos;ve done rela@@ tively little to ad@@ d@@ ress it .
To@@ day , of the top 10 caus@@ es of death wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s is the only one we cannot pre@@ v@@ ent , cur@@ e or even s@@ low down .
We understand less about the science of Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s than other dise@@ ases because we &apos;ve inv@@ es@@ ted less time and money into resear@@ ching it .
The U@@ S government s@@ pen@@ ds 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s des@@ pi@@ te the fact that Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s co@@ sts us more and caus@@ es a similar number of de@@ a@@ ths each year as cancer .
The lack of res@@ our@@ ces ste@@ ms from a more funda@@ mental cause : a lack of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
But we only have to look at a picture of a health@@ y ag@@ ed brain compar@@ ed to the brain of an Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s pati@@ ent to see the real physical da@@ ma@@ ge ca@@ used by this disease .
As well as tri@@ gg@@ er@@ ing se@@ ver@@ e lo@@ ss of memor@@ y and mental abili@@ ties , the da@@ ma@@ ge to the brain ca@@ used by Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s signifi@@ can@@ tly re@@ duc@@ es life expec@@ tan@@ cy and is always fa@@ tal .
Re@@ member D@@ r. Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer found st@@ ran@@ ge pla@@ qu@@ es and tan@@ g@@ les in Au@@ g@@ us@@ te &apos;s brain a cent@@ ur@@ y ago .
For almost a cent@@ ur@@ y , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
To@@ day we know they &apos;re made from prote@@ in mole@@ cul@@ es .
You can imagine a prote@@ in mole@@ cu@@ le as a piece of pa@@ per that nor@@ m@@ ally fol@@ ds into an e@@ labor@@ ate piece of ori@@ ga@@ m@@ i .
There are s@@ po@@ ts on the pa@@ per that are stic@@ k@@ y .
And when it fol@@ ds correc@@ tly , these stic@@ k@@ y b@@ its end up on the inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some stic@@ k@@ y b@@ its are on the out@@ side .
This caus@@ es the prote@@ in mole@@ cul@@ es to stic@@ k to each other , for@@ ming c@@ lu@@ mp@@ s that ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally become lar@@ ge pla@@ qu@@ es and tan@@ g@@ les .
That &apos;s what we see in the bra@@ ins of Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s patients .
We &apos;ve sp@@ ent the pa@@ st 10 years at the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of C@@ a@@ mb@@ ri@@ dge trying to understand how this mal@@ func@@ tion works .
There are many ste@@ ps , and identi@@ f@@ ying which ste@@ p to try to blo@@ ck is comple@@ x — like de@@ f@@ using a bo@@ m@@ b .
C@@ u@@ tting one wi@@ re might do nothing .
C@@ u@@ tting others might make the bo@@ m@@ b ex@@ pl@@ ore .
We have to find the right ste@@ p to blo@@ ck , and then create a drug that does it .
Un@@ til rec@@ ently , we for the most part have been cu@@ tting w@@ ir@@ es and ho@@ ping for the best .
But now we &apos;ve got together a diver@@ se gro@@ up of people — medic@@ s , bio@@ logi@@ sts , gene@@ tici@@ sts , che@@ mi@@ sts , physi@@ ci@@ sts , eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ ans .
And together , we &apos;ve man@@ ag@@ ed to identi@@ f@@ y a cri@@ tical ste@@ p in the process and are now t@@ esting a new cla@@ ss of drugs which would speci@@ fi@@ cally blo@@ ck this ste@@ p and stop the disease .
Now let me show you some of our la@@ test resul@@ ts .
No one out@@ side of our lab has seen these yet .
Let &apos;s look at some vide@@ os of what happened when we t@@ es@@ ted these new drugs in wor@@ ms .
So these are health@@ y wor@@ ms , and you can see they &apos;re mo@@ ving around nor@@ m@@ ally .
These wor@@ ms , on the other hand , have prote@@ in mole@@ cul@@ es stic@@ king together inside them — like human@@ s with Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s .
And you can see they &apos;re c@@ lear@@ ly si@@ ck .
But if we give our new drugs to these wor@@ ms at an early sta@@ ge , then we see that they &apos;re health@@ y , and they live a normal li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
This isn &apos;t about scienti@@ sts like me — it &apos;s about you .
That was es@@ senti@@ al for ad@@ van@@ c@@ ing tre@@ at@@ ment for H@@ I@@ V in the late 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
To@@ day , we see that same dri@@ ve to be@@ at cancer .
But Al@@ z@@ he@@ imer &apos;s patients are of@@ ten un@@ able to spe@@ ak up for themselves .
And their famili@@ es , the hi@@ d@@ den vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms , car@@ ing for their lo@@ ved ones ni@@ ght and day , are of@@ ten too wor@@ n out to go out and ad@@ vo@@ cate for change .
So , it really is down to you .
E@@ very@@ one with a brain is at ris@@ k .
To@@ day , there are 40 million patients like Au@@ g@@ us@@ te , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves .
H@@ el@@ p spe@@ ak up for them , and help de@@ m@@ and a cur@@ e .
Thank you .

My tra@@ vel@@ s to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan beg@@ an many , many years ago on the e@@ a@@ ster@@ n bor@@ der of my country , my ho@@ me@@ land , Pol@@ and .
I was wal@@ king through the for@@ est@@ s of my gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s tal@@ es .
A land where every fiel@@ d hi@@ des a gra@@ ve , where mi@@ llions of people have been de@@ por@@ ted or k@@ il@@ led in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y .
Be@@ hind the dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion , I found a s@@ ou@@ l of places .
I me@@ t hu@@ m@@ ble people .
I heard their pra@@ y@@ er and ate their bre@@ ad .
Then I have been wal@@ king E@@ ast for 20 years — from E@@ a@@ ster@@ n Europe to C@@ ent@@ ral A@@ si@@ a — through the C@@ au@@ ca@@ su@@ s Mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins , M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
And I ever me@@ t more hu@@ m@@ ble people .
And I shar@@ ed their bre@@ ad and their pra@@ y@@ er .
This is why I went to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
One day , I cro@@ s@@ sed the bri@@ dge over the O@@ x@@ us R@@ i@@ ver .
I was al@@ one on fo@@ o@@ t .
And the Af@@ g@@ ha@@ n sol@@ di@@ er was so sur@@ pri@@ sed to see me that he for@@ got to sta@@ m@@ p my pas@@ s@@ port .
But he ga@@ ve me a cu@@ p of te@@ a .
And I underst@@ o@@ od that his sur@@ pri@@ se was my protec@@ tion .
So I have been wal@@ king and tra@@ vel@@ ing , by hor@@ ses , by y@@ ak , by tr@@ uc@@ k , by h@@ it@@ ch@@ hi@@ king , from I@@ ran &apos;s bor@@ der to the bot@@ to@@ m , to the e@@ dge of the W@@ a@@ k@@ ha@@ n C@@ or@@ ri@@ dor .
And in this way I could find no@@ or , the hi@@ d@@ den light of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
My only we@@ a@@ po@@ n was my no@@ te@@ book and my Le@@ ica .
I heard pra@@ y@@ ers of the Su@@ f@@ i — hu@@ m@@ ble M@@ us@@ li@@ ms , ha@@ ted by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
H@@ id@@ den ri@@ ver , inter@@ connec@@ ted with the my@@ sti@@ ci@@ s@@ m from Gi@@ br@@ al@@ tar to In@@ dia .
The mos@@ que where the res@@ pec@@ t@@ ful fo@@ re@@ ig@@ ner is sho@@ wer@@ ed with b@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ings and with te@@ ar@@ s , and w@@ el@@ come@@ d as a gi@@ ft .
What do we know about the country and the people that we pre@@ ten@@ d to protec@@ t , about the vi@@ l@@ la@@ ges where the only one medic@@ ine to k@@ ill the pa@@ in and to stop the hun@@ ger is op@@ i@@ um ?
These are op@@ i@@ u@@ m@@ -@@ ad@@ dic@@ ted people on the ro@@ of@@ s of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l 10 years after the beg@@ in@@ ning of our w@@ ar .
These are the no@@ ma@@ d gir@@ ls who became pro@@ stitu@@ tes for Af@@ g@@ ha@@ n bus@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ men .
What do we know about the wo@@ men 10 years after the w@@ ar ?
C@@ lo@@ the@@ d in this n@@ y@@ l@@ on ba@@ g , made in Ch@@ ina , with the name of bur@@ q@@ a .
I saw one day , the lar@@ g@@ est school in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , a gir@@ ls &apos; school .
1@@ 3@@ ,000 gir@@ ls stud@@ ying here in the roo@@ ms under@@ ground , full of s@@ cor@@ pi@@ ons .
And their love &#91; for stud@@ ying &#93; was so big that I cri@@ ed .
What do we know about the death th@@ re@@ at@@ s by the T@@ ali@@ ban na@@ i@@ led on the do@@ ors of the people who d@@ are to sen@@ d their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters to school as in B@@ al@@ k@@ h ?
The re@@ gi@@ on is not se@@ cur@@ e , but full of the T@@ ali@@ ban , and they did it .
My ai@@ m is to give a vo@@ ice to the si@@ l@@ ent people , to show the hi@@ d@@ den li@@ ghts be@@ hind the cur@@ tain of the great game , the small wor@@ l@@ ds ig@@ no@@ red by the media and the pro@@ p@@ he@@ ts of a global con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
And that happened a lot : &quot; You po@@ m@@ mi@@ es , you can &apos;t play cri@@ c@@ ket , ru@@ g@@ by . &quot;
And of course , they were right .
But it &apos;s not just Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a that has better health than Bri@@ tain .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in Bri@@ tain , there is a gra@@ di@@ ent of health — and this is what &apos;s called stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed mor@@ tal@@ ity , basi@@ cally your chan@@ ces of d@@ ying .
This is looking at data from the pa@@ per about 20 years ago , but it &apos;s true today .
Now , we know about s@@ mo@@ king , de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ fri@@ ed Mar@@ s bar@@ s , chi@@ ps — the G@@ la@@ s@@ go@@ w di@@ et .
But this gra@@ p@@ h is after taking into ac@@ coun@@ t all of these kno@@ wn ris@@ k fac@@ tors .
And we need vi@@ ta@@ min D@@ . It &apos;s now a re@@ qui@@ re@@ ment that children have a cer@@ tain amount .
And I as a child was f@@ ed co@@ d li@@ ver oil by my gran@@ d@@ mother .
I dist@@ inc@@ tly — no@@ body for@@ gets co@@ d li@@ ver oil .
There see@@ ms to be a lot of data su@@ gg@@ esting that vi@@ ta@@ min D is very good for you .
And it is , to pre@@ v@@ ent ri@@ c@@ ke@@ ts and so on .
It &apos;s not the only reason pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing heart disease .
An@@ y@@ way , I came back from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , and des@@ pi@@ te the obvi@@ ous ris@@ ks to my health , I mo@@ ved to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en .
But I also became interes@@ ted in research , and in particular I became interes@@ ted in this sub@@ st@@ ance , n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de .
And they were the first people to descri@@ be this new che@@ mi@@ cal transmi@@ tter , n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de .
What n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de does is it di@@ la@@ tes blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s , so it low@@ ers your blood pres@@ sure .
It also di@@ la@@ tes the co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ teri@@ es , so it st@@ op@@ s an@@ g@@ ina .
And I started doing research , and we found , very exci@@ t@@ ing@@ ly , that the sk@@ in produc@@ es n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de .
It ar@@ is@@ es in the sk@@ in .
How do you have low blood pres@@ sure in your sk@@ in ?
We thought that maybe n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de af@@ fec@@ ted cell death , and how cells sur@@ vi@@ ve , and their resist@@ ance to other things .
So they &apos;re really an ide@@ al mode@@ l .
C@@ ould the s@@ un activ@@ ate those st@@ ores into the cir@@ cu@@ lation , and there in the cir@@ cu@@ lation do its good things for your car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cular system ?
And so what we did was we took a bun@@ ch of vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and we ex@@ pos@@ ed them to ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light .
So these are kind of s@@ un@@ la@@ mp@@ s .
So we used ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let A , which doesn &apos;t make vi@@ ta@@ min D@@ .
But cer@@ tain@@ ly in people ol@@ der than my wi@@ fe , this ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s to be a more mar@@ ked effec@@ t .
There is no change in blood f@@ low , in di@@ la@@ tation of the blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s .
But the ac@@ tive ir@@ radi@@ ation , dur@@ ing the U@@ V and for an h@@ our after it , there is di@@ lation of the blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s .
D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ent wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths of light have different activi@@ ties of doing that .
So you can look at the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths of light that do that .
In win@@ ter or su@@ mm@@ er , it &apos;s the same amount of light .
So what you can do is you can multi@@ p@@ ly those data by the N@@ O that &apos;s re@@ lea@@ sed and you can cal@@ cu@@ late how much n@@ it@@ ri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de would be re@@ lea@@ sed from the sk@@ in into the cir@@ cu@@ lation .
So if you &apos;re on the equ@@ at@@ or , D@@ ec@@ e@@ mber or J@@ un@@ e , you &apos;ve got mas@@ ses of N@@ O being re@@ lea@@ sed from the sk@@ in .
So V@@ ent@@ ur@@ a is in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
We &apos;re still working at this story , we &apos;re still develo@@ ping it , we &apos;re still ex@@ pan@@ ding it .
We think it &apos;s very important .
And this is on@@ going work , but der@@ ma@@ to@@ logi@@ sts — I mean , I &apos;m a der@@ ma@@ to@@ lo@@ g@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is a question that parents ask me all the time .
&quot; Why did my child develo@@ p autism ? &quot;
As a pedi@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ an , as a gene@@ tici@@ st , as a resear@@ ch@@ er , we try and ad@@ d@@ ress that question .
That same diagno@@ sis of autism , though , also ap@@ pli@@ es to G@@ abri@@ el , another 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y who has quite a different set of ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es .
He &apos;s actually quite re@@ mar@@ k@@ ab@@ ly gi@@ f@@ ted in ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics .
He doesn &apos;t make ey@@ e con@@ tac@@ t .
He has dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty star@@ ting a conversa@@ tion , fe@@ els aw@@ k@@ ward , and when he gets ner@@ v@@ ous , he actually s@@ hu@@ ts down .
Y@@ et both of these bo@@ ys have the same diagno@@ sis of autism spec@@ tru@@ m dis@@ order .
One of the things that con@@ cer@@ ns us is whether or not there really is an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic of autism .
These days , one in 8@@ 8 children will be diagno@@ sed with autism , and the question is , why does this gra@@ p@@ h look this way ?
H@@ as that number been incre@@ as@@ ing dra@@ ma@@ tically over time ?
O@@ r is it because we have now started la@@ be@@ ling individu@@ als with autism , simply gi@@ ving them a diagno@@ sis when they were still present there before yet simply didn &apos;t have that la@@ bel ?
And in fact , in the late 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the early 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s , le@@ g@@ is@@ lation was pas@@ sed that actually pro@@ vi@@ ded individu@@ als with autism with res@@ our@@ ces , with ac@@ cess to edu@@ ca@@ tional materi@@ als that would help them .
As a resul@@ t of that , more individu@@ als were diagno@@ sed and got ac@@ cess to the res@@ our@@ ces they nee@@ ded .
In ad@@ di@@ tion , we &apos;ve chan@@ ged our defini@@ tion over time , so in fact we &apos;ve wi@@ den@@ ed the defini@@ tion of autism , and that ac@@ coun@@ ts for some of the incre@@ a@@ sed pre@@ val@@ ence that we see .
The next question everyone wonder@@ s is , what ca@@ used autism ?
And a common mis@@ concep@@ tion is that vac@@ cin@@ es cause autism .
But let me be very c@@ lear : V@@ ac@@ cin@@ es do not cause autism .
( Applause ) In fact , the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al research study that su@@ gg@@ es@@ ted that was the case was comple@@ tely fra@@ ud@@ ul@@ ent .
It was actually re@@ tra@@ c@@ ted from the j@@ our@@ n@@ al L@@ an@@ ce@@ t , in which it was publi@@ sh@@ ed , and that au@@ th@@ or , a physi@@ ci@@ an , had his medical li@@ cen@@ se ta@@ ken away from him .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , one of the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents in vac@@ cin@@ es , something called th@@ im@@ er@@ osa@@ l , was thought to be what the cause of autism was .
That was actually re@@ mo@@ ved from vac@@ cin@@ es in the year 19@@ 9@@ 2 , and you can see that it really did not have an effec@@ t in what happened with the pre@@ val@@ ence of autism .
So the question rema@@ ins , what does cause autism ?
In fact , there &apos;s probably not one single answer .
B@@ a@@ sed on e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ o@@ logical data , we know that one of the caus@@ es , or one of the as@@ soci@@ ations , I should say , is ad@@ van@@ ced pa@@ ter@@ n@@ al age , that is , incre@@ as@@ ing age of the fa@@ ther at the time of concep@@ tion .
In particular , there &apos;s a medi@@ cation , val@@ pro@@ ic a@@ ci@@ d , which mo@@ thers with e@@ pi@@ le@@ p@@ s@@ y sometimes take , we know can incre@@ ase that ris@@ k of autism .
In ad@@ di@@ tion , there can be some infec@@ ti@@ ous ag@@ ents that can also cause autism .
And one of the things I &apos;m going to s@@ pen@@ d a lot of time fo@@ c@@ using on are the genes that can cause autism .
I &apos;m fo@@ c@@ using on this not because genes are the only cause of autism , but it &apos;s a cause of autism that we can re@@ adi@@ ly defin@@ e and be able to better understand the bio@@ logy and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es to be able to inter@@ ven@@ e .
One of the genetic fac@@ tors that we don &apos;t understand , ho@@ we@@ ver , is the differ@@ ence that we see in ter@@ ms of mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es .
M@@ al@@ es are af@@ fec@@ ted four to one compar@@ ed to fe@@ mal@@ es with autism , and we really don &apos;t understand what that cause is .
One of the ways that we can understand that gene@@ tics is a fac@@ tor is by looking at something called the con@@ cor@@ d@@ ance rate .
And we can look in particular at three ty@@ pes of si@@ b@@ l@@ ings : iden@@ tical tw@@ ins , tw@@ ins that actually share 100 percent of their genetic information and shar@@ ed the same in@@ tra@@ u@@ ter@@ ine environment , ver@@ su@@ s fra@@ ter@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins , tw@@ ins that actually share 50 percent of their genetic information , ver@@ su@@ s regu@@ lar si@@ b@@ l@@ ings , bro@@ ther@@ -@@ si@@ s@@ ter , si@@ ster@@ -@@ si@@ s@@ ter , also shar@@ ing 50 percent of their genetic information , yet not shar@@ ing the same in@@ tra@@ u@@ ter@@ ine environment .
And when you look at those con@@ cor@@ d@@ ance ra@@ ti@@ os , one of the stri@@ king things that you will see is that in iden@@ tical tw@@ ins , that con@@ cor@@ d@@ ance rate is 7@@ 7 percent .
It is not that genes ac@@ coun@@ t for all of the ris@@ k for autism , but yet they ac@@ coun@@ t for a lot of that ris@@ k , because when you look at fra@@ ter@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins , that con@@ cor@@ d@@ ance rate is only 3@@ 1 percent .
O@@ n the other hand , there is a differ@@ ence between those fra@@ ter@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins and the si@@ b@@ l@@ ings , su@@ gg@@ esting that there are common ex@@ pos@@ ur@@ es for those fra@@ ter@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins that may not be shar@@ ed as com@@ mon@@ ly with si@@ b@@ l@@ ings al@@ one .
So this pro@@ vi@@ des some of the data that autism is genetic .
When we compar@@ e it to other condi@@ tions that we &apos;re famili@@ ar with , things like cancer , heart disease , diabe@@ tes , in fact , gene@@ tics pla@@ ys a much lar@@ ger ro@@ le in autism than it does in any of these other condi@@ tions .
But with this , that doesn &apos;t tell us what the genes are .
It doesn &apos;t even tell us in any one child , is it one gene or po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally a com@@ bin@@ ation of genes ?
And so in fact , in some individu@@ als with autism , it is genetic !
That is , that it is one single , power@@ ful , determin@@ is@@ tic gene that caus@@ es the autism .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , in other individu@@ als , it &apos;s genetic , that is , that it &apos;s actually a com@@ bin@@ ation of genes in part with the develo@@ p@@ mental process that ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely determin@@ es that ris@@ k for autism .
We don &apos;t know in any one person , neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly , which of those two ans@@ w@@ ers it is until we start di@@ gg@@ ing de@@ e@@ per .
So the question be@@ comes , how can we start to identi@@ f@@ y what exactly those genes are .
In cer@@ tain individu@@ als , they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism run@@ ning in the family .
And the reason is because in cer@@ tain individu@@ als , they can actually have genetic chan@@ ges or mu@@ ta@@ tions that are not pas@@ sed down from the mother or from the fa@@ ther , but actually start br@@ and new in them , mu@@ ta@@ tions that are present in the e@@ g@@ g or the s@@ per@@ m at the time of concep@@ tion but have not been pas@@ sed down gener@@ ation through gener@@ ation within the family .
And we can actually use that stra@@ te@@ gy to now understand and to identi@@ f@@ y those genes ca@@ using autism in those individu@@ als .
So in fact , at the S@@ im@@ ons Fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion , we took 2@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 individu@@ als that had no family hist@@ ory of autism , and we took that child and their mother and fa@@ ther and used them to try and understand what were those genes ca@@ using autism in those ca@@ ses ?
To do that , we actually had to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ vely be able to look at all that genetic information and determin@@ e what those differ@@ ences were between the mother , the fa@@ ther and the child .
In doing so , I a@@ po@@ logi@@ ze , I &apos;m going to use an out@@ da@@ ted anal@@ o@@ gy of en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedi@@ as ra@@ ther than W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , but I &apos;m going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inv@@ ent@@ ory , we nee@@ ded to be able to look at mas@@ sive amo@@ un@@ ts of information .
Ou@@ r genetic information is organi@@ zed into a set of 4@@ 6 volu@@ mes , and when we did that , we had to be able to ac@@ coun@@ t for each of those 4@@ 6 volu@@ mes , because in some ca@@ ses with autism , there &apos;s actually a single volu@@ me that &apos;s mis@@ sing .
We had to get more gran@@ ular than that , though , and so we had to start op@@ en@@ ing those bo@@ o@@ ks , and in some ca@@ ses , the genetic change was more sub@@ t@@ le .
It might have been a single par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h that was mis@@ sing , or yet , even more sub@@ t@@ le than that , a single le@@ tter , one out of three billion le@@ t@@ ters that was chan@@ ged , that was alter@@ ed , yet had pro@@ found effec@@ ts in ter@@ ms of how the brain func@@ tions and af@@ fec@@ ts behavi@@ or .
In doing this within these famili@@ es , we were able to ac@@ coun@@ t for appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 25 percent of the individu@@ als and determin@@ e that there was a single power@@ ful genetic fac@@ tor that ca@@ used autism within those famili@@ es .
O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s 7@@ 5 percent that we still ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red out .
As we did this , though , it was really quite hu@@ mb@@ ling , because we realiz@@ ed that there was not simply one gene for autism .
In fact , the cur@@ r@@ ent esti@@ ma@@ tes are that there are 200 to 4@@ 00 different genes that can cause autism .
And that ex@@ pla@@ ins , in part , why we see such a bro@@ ad spec@@ tru@@ m in ter@@ ms of its effec@@ ts .
Al@@ though there are that many genes , there is some me@@ th@@ od to the ma@@ d@@ ness .
It &apos;s not simply ran@@ dom 200 , 4@@ 00 different genes , but in fact they f@@ it together .
They f@@ it together in a path@@ way .
They f@@ it together in a ne@@ t@@ work that &apos;s star@@ ting to make sense now in ter@@ ms of how the brain func@@ tions .
But early diagno@@ sis is a k@@ ey for us .
Be@@ ing able to make that diagno@@ sis of someone who &apos;s s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble at a time in a win@@ do@@ w where we have the ability to trans@@ form , to be able to impac@@ t that gro@@ wing , develo@@ ping brain is cri@@ tical .
And so fol@@ ks like A@@ m@@ i K@@ li@@ n have developed me@@ th@@ o@@ ds to be able to take inf@@ an@@ ts , small bab@@ ies , and be able to use bio@@ mar@@ kers , in this case ey@@ e con@@ tac@@ t and ey@@ e tra@@ c@@ king , to identi@@ f@@ y an inf@@ ant at ris@@ k .
This particular inf@@ ant , you can see , making very good ey@@ e con@@ tac@@ t with this woman as she &apos;s sing@@ ing &quot; &quot; I@@ t@@ s@@ y , B@@ it@@ s@@ y S@@ pi@@ der , &quot; &quot; in fact is not going to develo@@ p autism .
This bab@@ y we know is going to be in the c@@ lear .
O@@ n the other hand , this other bab@@ y is going to go on to develo@@ p autism .
In this particular child , you can see , it &apos;s not making good ey@@ e con@@ tac@@ t .
In@@ stead of the eyes fo@@ c@@ using in and having that social connec@@ tion , looking at the m@@ outh , looking at the no@@ se , looking off in another direc@@ tion , but not again soci@@ ally connec@@ ting , and being able to do this on a very lar@@ ge s@@ cal@@ e , s@@ cre@@ en inf@@ an@@ ts , s@@ cre@@ en children for autism , through something very ro@@ b@@ ust , very reli@@ able , is going to be very hel@@ p@@ ful to us in ter@@ ms of being able to inter@@ ven@@ e at an early sta@@ ge when we can have the gre@@ at@@ est impac@@ t .
How are we going to inter@@ ven@@ e ?
It &apos;s probably going to be a com@@ bin@@ ation of fac@@ tors .
In part , in some individu@@ als , we &apos;re going to try and use medica@@ tions .
Be@@ y@@ on@@ d just drugs , we &apos;re going to use edu@@ ca@@ tional stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es .
In@@ di@@ vidu@@ als with autism , some of them are wi@@ red a little bit differ@@ ently .
They learn in a different way .
They ab@@ sor@@ b their sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings in a different way , and we need to be able to edu@@ cate them in a way that ser@@ ves them best .
All of these new technolo@@ gi@@ es just of@@ fer tre@@ men@@ dous op@@ portuni@@ ties for us to be able to impac@@ t the individu@@ als with autism , but yet we have a long way to go .
As much as we know , there is so much more that we don &apos;t know , and so I invi@@ te all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a commun@@ ity our col@@ lec@@ tive wis@@ dom to be able to make a differ@@ ence , and in particular , for the individu@@ als in famili@@ es with autism , I invi@@ te you to jo@@ in the interac@@ tive autism ne@@ t@@ work , to be part of the solu@@ tion to this , because it &apos;s going to take really a lot of us to think about what &apos;s important , what &apos;s going to be a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful differ@@ ence .
Thank you .
What &apos;s in the bo@@ x ?
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it is must be pretty important , because I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led with it , mo@@ ved it , from apar@@ t@@ ment to apar@@ t@@ ment to apar@@ t@@ ment .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) S@@ ound famili@@ ar ?
D@@ id you know that we Amer@@ ic@@ ans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
Th@@ ree times .
So you &apos;d think , with all this ex@@ tra space , we &apos;d have pl@@ ent@@ y of room for all our stuff .
N@@ op@@ e .
There &apos;s a new indu@@ stry in to@@ wn , a 2@@ 2 bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar , 2@@ .@@ 2 billion s@@ q@@ . f@@ t@@ . indu@@ stry : that of person@@ al stor@@ age .
So we &apos;ve got tri@@ ple the space , but we &apos;ve become such good sho@@ p@@ per@@ s that we need even more space .
So where does this le@@ ad ?
L@@ ots of cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d de@@ b@@ t , hu@@ ge environ@@ mental fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ ts , and per@@ haps not co@@ inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , our happ@@ in@@ ess lev@@ els f@@ la@@ t@@ -@@ lin@@ ed over the same 50 years .
Well I &apos;m here to su@@ gg@@ est there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equ@@ al more .
I be@@ t most of us have experi@@ en@@ ced at some point the jo@@ ys of less : colle@@ ge — in your d@@ or@@ m , tra@@ vel@@ ing — in a ho@@ te@@ l room , camp@@ ing — ri@@ g up basi@@ cally nothing , maybe a bo@@ at .
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it was for you , I be@@ t that , a@@ mon@@ g other things , this ga@@ ve you a little more f@@ ree@@ dom , a little more time .
So I &apos;m going to su@@ gg@@ est that less stuff and less space are going to equ@@ al a s@@ mal@@ ler fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int .
It &apos;s actually a great way to sa@@ ve you some money .
And it &apos;s going to give you a little more e@@ ase in your life .
So I started a project called Li@@ fe E@@ di@@ ted at li@@ fe@@ edi@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ or@@ g to f@@ ur@@ ther this conversa@@ tion and to find some great solu@@ tions in this are@@ a .
F@@ ir@@ st up : cro@@ w@@ d-@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing my 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . f@@ t@@ . apar@@ t@@ ment in Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan with par@@ t@@ n@@ ers Mu@@ to@@ po and Jo@@ v@@ ot@@ o@@ .@@ com@@ .
I wanted it all — home of@@ fi@@ ce , si@@ t down din@@ ner for 10 , room for gu@@ est@@ s , and all my ki@@ te sur@@ f@@ ing ge@@ ar .
W@@ ith over 3@@ 00 ent@@ ri@@ es from around the world , I got it , my own little j@@ e@@ w@@ el bo@@ x .
B@@ y bu@@ ying a space that was 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . ft .
instead of 6@@ 00 , im@@ medi@@ ately I &apos;m sa@@ ving 200 gr@@ and .
S@@ mal@@ ler space is going to make for s@@ mal@@ ler utili@@ ties — sa@@ ve some more money there , but also a s@@ mal@@ ler fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int .
And because it &apos;s really desig@@ ned around an edi@@ ted set of pos@@ s@@ es@@ si@@ ons — my fav@@ ori@@ te stuff — and really desig@@ ned for me , I &apos;m really exci@@ ted to be there .
So how can you live little ?
Th@@ ree ma@@ in appro@@ ach@@ es .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to edi@@ t ru@@ th@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly .
We &apos;ve got to c@@ lear the ar@@ teri@@ es of our lives .
And that sh@@ ir@@ t that I ha@@ dn &apos;t wor@@ n in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We &apos;ve got to c@@ ut the ex@@ tr@@ an@@ e@@ ous out of our lives , and we &apos;ve got to learn to ste@@ m the inf@@ low .
We need to think before we bu@@ y .
As@@ k ourselves , &quot; I@@ s that really going to make me hap@@ pi@@ er ? T@@ ru@@ ly ? &quot;
B@@ y all means , we should bu@@ y and own some great stuff .
But we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
Se@@ con@@ d@@ ly , our new man@@ tra : small is sex@@ y .
We want space ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy .
We want things that are desig@@ ned for how they &apos;re used the v@@ ast ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the time , not that r@@ are ev@@ ent .
Why have a six bur@@ ner sto@@ ve when you r@@ are@@ ly use three ?
So we want things that n@@ est , we want things that sta@@ ck , and we want it di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed .
You can take pa@@ per@@ work , bo@@ o@@ ks , mo@@ vi@@ es , and you can make it disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar — it &apos;s ma@@ gi@@ c .
Fin@@ ally , we want multi@@ func@@ tional sp@@ aces and h@@ ou@@ se@@ war@@ es — a sin@@ k com@@ bin@@ ed with a to@@ i@@ let , a din@@ ing table be@@ comes a bed — same space , a little side table stre@@ t@@ ches out to se@@ at 10 .
In the win@@ ning Li@@ fe E@@ di@@ ted s@@ che@@ me in a ren@@ der here , we com@@ b@@ ine a mo@@ ving w@@ all with trans@@ for@@ m@@ er f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to get a lot out of the space .
L@@ oo@@ k at the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e table — it gro@@ ws in he@@ ight and wi@@ d@@ th to se@@ at 10 .
My of@@ fi@@ ce fol@@ ds away , e@@ asi@@ ly hi@@ d@@ den .
My bed just po@@ ps out of the w@@ all with two f@@ ing@@ ers .
Gu@@ est@@ s ? Mo@@ ve the mo@@ ving w@@ all , have some fol@@ d-@@ down gu@@ est be@@ ds .
And of course , my own mo@@ vi@@ e the@@ ater .
So I &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . ft .
But consi@@ der the ben@@ ef@@ its of an edi@@ ted life .
G@@ o from 3@@ ,000 to 2@@ ,000 , from 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 to 1@@ ,000 .
Mo@@ st of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty hap@@ pi@@ ly for a bun@@ ch of days with a cou@@ ple of b@@ ag@@ s , maybe a small space , a ho@@ te@@ l room .
So when you go home and you wal@@ k through your front do@@ or , take a second and ask your@@ selves , &quot; &quot; C@@ ould I do with a little life edi@@ ting ?
W@@ ould that give me a little more f@@ ree@@ dom ?
Ma@@ ybe a little more time ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s in the bo@@ x ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in your@@ s ?
Ma@@ ybe , just maybe , less might equ@@ al more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .

When I was 10 years old , a cous@@ in of min@@ e took me on a t@@ our of his medical school .
And as a spe@@ cial tre@@ at , he took me to the path@@ o@@ logy lab and took a real human brain out of the j@@ ar and pl@@ ac@@ ed it in my han@@ ds .
And there it was , the se@@ at of human consci@@ ousness , the power@@ house of the human body , si@@ tting in my han@@ ds .
And that day I knew that when I gre@@ w up , I was going to become a brain doc@@ tor , scienti@@ st , something or the other .
Y@@ ear@@ s later , when I finally gre@@ w up , my dre@@ am came true .
And it was while I was doing my P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
on the neuro@@ logical caus@@ es of dy@@ s@@ le@@ xi@@ a in children that I en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed a star@@ t@@ ling fact that I &apos;d like to share with you all today .
It is esti@@ ma@@ ted that one in six children , that &apos;s one in six children , suf@@ fer from some develo@@ p@@ mental dis@@ order .
This is a dis@@ order that re@@ tar@@ ds mental develo@@ p@@ ment in the child and caus@@ es per@@ man@@ ent mental im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments .
Wh@@ ich means that each and every one of you here today kno@@ ws at le@@ ast one child that is suf@@ fer@@ ing from a develo@@ p@@ mental dis@@ order .
But here &apos;s what really per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed me .
Des@@ pi@@ te the fact that each and every one of these dis@@ or@@ ders ori@@ g@@ in@@ ates in the brain , most of these dis@@ or@@ ders are diagno@@ sed so@@ le@@ ly on the bas@@ is of observ@@ able behavi@@ or .
But diagno@@ sing a brain dis@@ order without actually looking at the brain is anal@@ o@@ g@@ ous to tre@@ ating a pati@@ ent with a heart problem based on their physical sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms , without even doing an E@@ C@@ G or a ch@@ est X@@ -@@ ra@@ y to look at the heart .
It see@@ med so in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive to me .
To diagno@@ se and tre@@ at a brain dis@@ order ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely , it would be neces@@ s@@ ary to look at the brain direc@@ tly .
L@@ oo@@ king at behavi@@ or al@@ one can mi@@ ss a vi@@ tal piece of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le and pro@@ vi@@ de an in@@ comple@@ te , or even a mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ing , picture of the child &apos;s problems .
Y@@ et , des@@ pi@@ te all the ad@@ van@@ ces in medical technology , the diagno@@ sis of brain dis@@ or@@ ders in one in six children still rema@@ in@@ ed so limi@@ ted .
And then I came across a te@@ am at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Uni@@ versi@@ ty that had ta@@ ken one such ad@@ van@@ ced medical technology and finally ap@@ pli@@ ed it , instead of in brain research , to@@ war@@ ds diagno@@ sing brain dis@@ or@@ ders in children .
Th@@ e@@ ir gro@@ und@@ bre@@ a@@ king technology recor@@ ds the E@@ E@@ G , or the elec@@ tri@@ cal activi@@ ty of the brain , in real time , al@@ lo@@ wing us to wat@@ ch the brain as it per@@ for@@ ms vari@@ ous func@@ tions and then detec@@ t even the sli@@ gh@@ test ab@@ nor@@ mal@@ ity in any of these func@@ tions : vi@@ sion , attention , language , audi@@ tion .
A progra@@ m called B@@ ra@@ in E@@ lec@@ tri@@ cal A@@ c@@ tivi@@ ty M@@ ap@@ ping then tri@@ an@@ gu@@ la@@ tes the s@@ our@@ ce of that ab@@ nor@@ mal@@ ity in the brain .
And another progra@@ m called Sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal Pro@@ b@@ ability M@@ ap@@ ping then per@@ for@@ ms ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions to determin@@ e whether any of these ab@@ nor@@ m@@ ali@@ ties are c@@ lin@@ ic@@ ally signifi@@ can@@ t , al@@ lo@@ wing us to pro@@ vi@@ de a much more ac@@ cu@@ rate neuro@@ logical diagno@@ sis of the child &apos;s sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms .
And so I became the head of neuro@@ physi@@ o@@ logy for the c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal ar@@ m of this te@@ am , and we &apos;re finally able to use this technology to@@ war@@ ds actually hel@@ ping children with brain dis@@ or@@ ders .
And I &apos;m happ@@ y to say that I &apos;m now in the process of se@@ tting up this technology here in In@@ dia .
I &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , wh@@ ose story was also co@@ vered by A@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws .
Se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -old J@@ us@@ ti@@ n S@@ en@@ i@@ gar came to our c@@ lin@@ ic with this diagno@@ sis of very se@@ ver@@ e autism .
Li@@ ke many auti@@ stic children , his mind was lo@@ c@@ ked inside his body .
There were mo@@ ments when he would actually space out for secon@@ ds at a time .
And the doc@@ tors told his parents he was never going to be able to communi@@ cate or interac@@ t soci@@ ally , and he would probably never have too much language .
When we used this gro@@ und@@ bre@@ a@@ king E@@ E@@ G technology to actually look at J@@ us@@ ti@@ n &apos;s brain , the resul@@ ts were star@@ t@@ ling .
It tur@@ ned out that J@@ us@@ ti@@ n was almost cer@@ tain@@ ly not auti@@ stic .
He was suf@@ fer@@ ing from brain se@@ i@@ z@@ ur@@ es that were im@@ possible to see with the na@@ ked ey@@ e , but that were actually ca@@ using sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms that mi@@ mi@@ c@@ ked those of autism .
Af@@ ter J@@ us@@ ti@@ n was given anti@@ -@@ se@@ i@@ z@@ ure medi@@ cation , the change in him was amazing .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in a peri@@ od of 60 days , his vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ary went from two to three words to 3@@ 00 words .
And his communi@@ cation and social interac@@ tion were impro@@ ved so dra@@ ma@@ tically that he was en@@ ro@@ l@@ led into a regu@@ lar school and even became a k@@ ar@@ ate su@@ per cha@@ m@@ p .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch sho@@ ws that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagno@@ sed with autism are actually suf@@ fer@@ ing from hi@@ d@@ den brain se@@ i@@ z@@ ur@@ es .
These are the fac@@ es of the children that I have t@@ es@@ ted with stories just like J@@ us@@ ti@@ n .
All these children came to our c@@ lin@@ ic with a diagno@@ sis of autism , attention de@@ fici@@ t dis@@ order , mental re@@ tar@@ da@@ tion , language problems .
In@@ stead , our E@@ E@@ G s@@ can@@ s re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed very speci@@ fic problems hi@@ d@@ den within their bra@@ ins that coul@@ dn &apos;t pos@@ si@@ bly have been detec@@ ted by their behavi@@ or@@ al as@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ ments .
So these E@@ E@@ G s@@ can@@ s en@@ ab@@ led us to pro@@ vi@@ de these children with a much more ac@@ cu@@ rate neuro@@ logical diagno@@ sis and much more tar@@ ge@@ ted tre@@ at@@ ment .
For too long now , children with develo@@ p@@ mental dis@@ or@@ ders have suf@@ fer@@ ed from mis@@ diagno@@ sis while their real problems have g@@ one un@@ detec@@ ted and left to wor@@ sen .
And for too long , these children and their parents have suf@@ fer@@ ed un@@ du@@ e f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion and des@@ per@@ ation .
But we are now in a new era of neuro@@ science , one in which we can finally look direc@@ tly at brain func@@ tion in real time with no ris@@ ks and no side effec@@ ts , n@@ on-@@ in@@ va@@ si@@ vely , and find the true s@@ our@@ ce of so many disa@@ bili@@ ties in children .
So if I could in@@ spi@@ re even a f@@ rac@@ tion of you in the audi@@ ence today to share this pi@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ing diagno@@ stic appro@@ ach with even one par@@ ent wh@@ ose child is suf@@ fer@@ ing from a develo@@ p@@ mental dis@@ order , then per@@ haps one more pu@@ z@@ z@@ le in one more brain will be sol@@ ved .
One more mind will be un@@ lo@@ c@@ ked .
And one more child who has been mis@@ diagno@@ sed or even un@@ diagno@@ sed by the system will finally realiz@@ e his or her true po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al while there &apos;s still time for his or her brain to reco@@ ver .
And all this by simply wat@@ ching the child &apos;s bra@@ in@@ wa@@ ves .
Thank you .

Ima@@ g@@ ine if you could recor@@ d your life — everything you said , everything you did , a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble in a perfec@@ t memor@@ y st@@ ore at your f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps , so you could go back and find memor@@ able mo@@ ments and re@@ live them , or si@@ ft through tra@@ ces of time and disco@@ ver pa@@ tter@@ ns in your own life that pre@@ vi@@ ously had g@@ one un@@ disco@@ vered .
Well that &apos;s exactly the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y that my family beg@@ an five and a half years ago .
This is my wi@@ fe and col@@ labor@@ at@@ or , R@@ u@@ p@@ al .
And on this day , at this moment , we wal@@ ked into the house with our first child , our beautiful bab@@ y bo@@ y .
And we wal@@ ked into a house with a very spe@@ cial home video recor@@ ding system .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : Okay .
De@@ b R@@ o@@ y : This moment and thousands of other mo@@ ments spe@@ cial for us were cap@@ tu@@ red in our home because in every room in the house , if you looked up , you &apos;d see a cam@@ era and a micro@@ ph@@ one , and if you looked down , you &apos;d get this bir@@ d &apos;@@ s@@ -@@ ey@@ e vie@@ w of the room .
Here &apos;s our living room , the bab@@ y be@@ dro@@ o@@ m , k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , din@@ ing room and the res@@ t of the house .
And all of these f@@ ed into a dis@@ c arra@@ y that was desig@@ ned for a continu@@ ous cap@@ ture .
So here we are fl@@ ying through a day in our home as we move from s@@ un@@ li@@ t mor@@ ning through in@@ can@@ des@@ cent e@@ ven@@ ing and , finally , li@@ ghts out for the day .
O@@ ver the course of three years , we recor@@ ded ei@@ ght to 10 h@@ our@@ s a day , ama@@ s@@ sing rou@@ gh@@ ly a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ million h@@ our@@ s of multi@@ -@@ tra@@ ck audi@@ o and video .
So you &apos;re looking at a piece of what is by far the lar@@ g@@ est home video col@@ lec@@ tion ever made .
( Laughter ) And what this data repres@@ ents for our family at a person@@ al level , the impac@@ t has already been im@@ men@@ se , and we &apos;re still learning its valu@@ e .
Co@@ un@@ t@@ less mo@@ ments of un@@ so@@ li@@ ci@@ ted natural mo@@ ments , not pos@@ ed mo@@ ments , are cap@@ tu@@ red there , and we &apos;re star@@ ting to learn how to disco@@ ver them and find them .
But there &apos;s also a scienti@@ fic reason that dro@@ ve this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ g@@ it@@ ud@@ in@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns language — that child being my son .
And so with many pri@@ vac@@ y pro@@ visi@@ ons put in place to protec@@ t everyone who was recor@@ ded in the data , we made ele@@ ments of the data a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to my tr@@ us@@ ted research te@@ am at M@@ I@@ T so we could start te@@ as@@ ing a@@ part pa@@ tter@@ ns in this mas@@ sive data set , trying to understand the inf@@ lu@@ ence of social environ@@ ments on language ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion .
So we &apos;re looking here at one of the first things we started to do .
This is my wi@@ fe and I co@@ o@@ king bre@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ ast in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , and as we move through space and through time , a very every@@ day pa@@ tter@@ n of life in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
In order to conver@@ t this o@@ pa@@ que , 9@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of video into something that we could start to see , we use mo@@ tion anal@@ y@@ sis to pul@@ l out , as we move through space and through time , what we call sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time wor@@ ms .
And this has become part of our to@@ ol@@ k@@ it for being able to look and see where the activi@@ ties are in the data , and with it , tra@@ ce the pa@@ tter@@ n of , in particular , where my son mo@@ ved throu@@ gh@@ out the home , so that we could fo@@ c@@ us our trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tion ef@@ for@@ ts , all of the spe@@ ec@@ h environment around my son — all of the words that he heard from myself , my wi@@ fe , our n@@ an@@ ny , and over time , the words he beg@@ an to produ@@ ce .
So with that technology and that data and the ability to , with mach@@ ine as@@ si@@ st@@ ance , trans@@ cri@@ be spe@@ ec@@ h , we &apos;ve now trans@@ cri@@ bed well over se@@ ven million words of our home trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts .
And with that , let me take you now for a first t@@ our into the data .
So you &apos;ve all , I &apos;m sure , seen ti@@ me@@ -@@ la@@ p@@ se vide@@ os where a flo@@ wer will blo@@ s@@ so@@ m as you ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate time .
I &apos;d like you to now experience the blo@@ s@@ so@@ ming of a spe@@ ec@@ h form .
My son , so@@ on after his first bir@@ th@@ day , would say &quot; &quot; g@@ ag@@ a &quot; &quot; to mean water .
And over the course of the next hal@@ f-@@ year , he s@@ low@@ ly learned to appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te the pro@@ per adul@@ t form , &quot; &quot; water . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re going to cru@@ i@@ se through half a year in about 40 secon@@ ds .
No video here , so you can fo@@ c@@ us on the sound , the a@@ cous@@ tics , of a new kind of tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory : g@@ ag@@ a to water .
( Au@@ dio ) B@@ ab@@ y : G@@ ag@@ ag@@ ag@@ ag@@ ag@@ a G@@ ag@@ a g@@ ag@@ a g@@ ag@@ a gu@@ ga gu@@ ga gu@@ ga wa@@ da g@@ ag@@ a g@@ ag@@ a gu@@ ga g@@ ag@@ a wa@@ der gu@@ ga gu@@ ga water water water water water water water water water .
D@@ R : He sure na@@ i@@ led it , didn &apos;t he .
( Applause ) So he didn &apos;t just learn water .
O@@ ver the course of the 2@@ 4 months , the first two years that we really fo@@ cu@@ sed on , this is a ma@@ p of every word he learned in ch@@ ro@@ nolo@@ gi@@ cal order .
And because we have full trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts , we &apos;ve identi@@ fi@@ ed each of the 5@@ 0@@ 3 words that he learned to produ@@ ce by his second bir@@ th@@ day .
He was an early tal@@ ker .
And so we started to anal@@ y@@ ze why .
Why were cer@@ tain words bor@@ n before others ?
This is one of the first resul@@ ts that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really sur@@ pri@@ sed us .
The way to inter@@ pre@@ t this ap@@ par@@ ently simple gra@@ p@@ h is , on the ver@@ tical is an indi@@ cation of how comple@@ x car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces are based on the l@@ eng@@ th of u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces .
And the &#91; h@@ ori@@ zon@@ tal &#93; ax@@ is is time .
And all of the data , we ali@@ g@@ ned based on the fol@@ lo@@ wing idea : E@@ very time my son would learn a word , we would tra@@ ce back and look at all of the language he heard that con@@ tain@@ ed that word .
And we would p@@ lot the rela@@ tive l@@ eng@@ th of the u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces .
And what we found was this curi@@ ous ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ a , that car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver spe@@ ec@@ h would syste@@ ma@@ tically di@@ p to a min@@ im@@ um , making language as simple as possible , and then s@@ low@@ ly as@@ cen@@ d back up in comple@@ x@@ ity .
And the amazing thing was that bo@@ un@@ ce , that di@@ p , lin@@ ed up almost preci@@ se@@ ly with when each word was bor@@ n — word after word , syste@@ ma@@ tically .
So it ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s that all three pri@@ mar@@ y car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver@@ s — myself , my wi@@ fe and our n@@ an@@ ny — were syste@@ ma@@ tically and , I would think , sub@@ consci@@ ously r@@ estr@@ uc@@ tur@@ ing our language to me@@ et him at the bir@@ th of a word and br@@ ing him g@@ ently into more comple@@ x language .
And the imp@@ lica@@ tions of this — there are many , but one I just want to point out , is that there must be amazing fe@@ e@@ d@@ back lo@@ op@@ s .
O@@ f course , my son is learning from his lingu@@ is@@ tic environment , but the environment is learning from him .
That environment , people , are in these ti@@ ght fe@@ e@@ d@@ back lo@@ op@@ s and cre@@ ating a kind of s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding that has not been no@@ tic@@ ed until now .
But that &apos;s looking at the spe@@ ec@@ h con@@ text .
What about the visual con@@ text ?
We &apos;re not looking at — think of this as a dol@@ l@@ house cu@@ ta@@ way of our house .
We &apos;ve ta@@ ken those cir@@ cular fi@@ sh@@ -@@ ey@@ e len@@ s ca@@ mer@@ as , and we &apos;ve done some op@@ tical correc@@ tion , and then we can br@@ ing it into th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al life .
So w@@ el@@ come to my home .
This is a moment , one moment cap@@ tu@@ red across multi@@ ple ca@@ mer@@ as .
The reason we did this is to create the ul@@ ti@@ mate memor@@ y mach@@ ine , where you can go back and interac@@ tively f@@ ly around and then bre@@ a@@ the video@@ -@@ life into this system .
What I &apos;m going to do is give you an ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated vie@@ w of 30 minu@@ tes , again , of just life in the living room .
That &apos;s me and my son on the flo@@ or .
And there &apos;s video anal@@ y@@ tics that are tra@@ c@@ king our mo@@ ve@@ ments .
My son is lea@@ ving red in@@ k . I am lea@@ ving green in@@ k .
We &apos;re now on the co@@ uch , looking out through the win@@ do@@ w at car@@ s pas@@ sing by .
And finally , my son pla@@ ying in a wal@@ king to@@ y by hi@@ m@@ self .
Now we f@@ ree@@ ze the ac@@ tion , 30 minu@@ tes , we turn time into the ver@@ tical ax@@ is , and we open up for a vie@@ w of these interac@@ tion tra@@ ces we &apos;ve just left be@@ hind .
And we see these amazing struc@@ tures — these little k@@ n@@ ots of two col@@ ors of th@@ read we call &quot; &quot; social ho@@ t s@@ po@@ ts . &quot; &quot; The spi@@ ral th@@ read we call a &quot; &quot; so@@ lo ho@@ t s@@ po@@ t . &quot; &quot; And we think that these af@@ fec@@ t the way language is learned .
What we &apos;d like to do is start underst@@ an@@ ding the interac@@ tion between these pa@@ tter@@ ns and the language that my son is ex@@ pos@@ ed to to see if we can pre@@ dic@@ t how the struc@@ ture of when words are heard af@@ fec@@ ts when they &apos;re learned — so in other words , the rela@@ tion@@ ship between words and what they &apos;re about in the world .
So here &apos;s how we &apos;re appro@@ ach@@ ing this .
In this video , again , my son is being tra@@ ced out .
He &apos;s lea@@ ving red in@@ k be@@ hind .
And there &apos;s our n@@ an@@ ny by the do@@ or .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ an@@ ny : You want water ? ( B@@ ab@@ y : A@@ aa@@ a . ) N@@ an@@ ny : All right . ( B@@ ab@@ y : A@@ aa@@ a . ) D@@ R : She of@@ fer@@ s water , and off go the two wor@@ ms over to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en to get water .
And what we &apos;ve done is use the word &quot; &quot; water &quot; &quot; to ta@@ g that moment , that bit of activi@@ ty .
And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the con@@ text he saw it in , and we use it to pen@@ e@@ tra@@ te through the video and find every activi@@ ty tra@@ ce that co@@ -@@ oc@@ cur@@ red with an inst@@ ance of water .
And what this data lea@@ ves in its wa@@ ke is a lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe .
We call these wor@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es .
This is the wor@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe for the word water , and you can see most of the ac@@ tion is in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
That &apos;s where those big pe@@ a@@ ks are over to the left .
And just for contra@@ st , we can do this with any word .
We can take the word &quot; &quot; b@@ y@@ e &quot; &quot; as in &quot; &quot; good b@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;re now z@@ oo@@ med in over the entr@@ ance to the house .
And we look , and we find , as you would expec@@ t , a contra@@ st in the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe where the word &quot; &quot; b@@ y@@ e &quot; &quot; oc@@ cur@@ s much more in a struc@@ tu@@ red way .
So we &apos;re using these struc@@ tures to start pre@@ dic@@ ting the order of language ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , and that &apos;s on@@ going work now .
In my lab , which we &apos;re pe@@ er@@ ing into now , at M@@ I@@ T — this is at the media lab .
This has become my fav@@ ori@@ te way of vide@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ing just about any space .
Th@@ ree of the k@@ ey people in this project , P@@ hi@@ li@@ p De@@ C@@ am@@ p , R@@ ony K@@ u@@ b@@ at and B@@ ran@@ don R@@ o@@ y are pic@@ tu@@ red here .
P@@ hi@@ li@@ p has been a clo@@ se col@@ labor@@ at@@ or on all the visu@@ aliz@@ ations you &apos;re see@@ ing .
And M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el F@@ le@@ is@@ ch@@ man was another P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stud@@ ent in my lab who worked with me on this home video anal@@ y@@ sis , and he made the fol@@ lo@@ wing obser@@ va@@ tion : that &quot; &quot; just the way that we &apos;re anal@@ y@@ zing how language connec@@ ts to ev@@ ents which pro@@ vi@@ de common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , De@@ b , and we can ap@@ p@@ ly it to the world of publi@@ c media . &quot; &quot; And so our ef@@ for@@ t took an un@@ expec@@ ted turn .
Th@@ in@@ k of ma@@ ss media as pro@@ vi@@ ding common ground and you have the reci@@ pe for taking this idea to a whole new place .
We &apos;ve started anal@@ y@@ zing tele@@ vi@@ sion cont@@ ent using the same princi@@ pl@@ es — anal@@ y@@ zing ev@@ ent struc@@ ture of a T@@ V si@@ gn@@ al — e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of sho@@ ws , com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als , all of the com@@ pon@@ ents that make up the ev@@ ent struc@@ ture .
And we &apos;re now , with sa@@ te@@ lli@@ te di@@ sh@@ es , pul@@ ling and anal@@ y@@ zing a good part of all the T@@ V being wat@@ ched in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
And you don &apos;t have to now go and instru@@ ment living roo@@ ms with micro@@ ph@@ ones to get people &apos;s conversa@@ tions , you just tun@@ e into publi@@ c@@ ly a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble social media fe@@ e@@ ds .
So we &apos;re pul@@ ling in about three billion com@@ ments a mon@@ th , and then the ma@@ gi@@ c happens .
You have the ev@@ ent struc@@ ture , the common ground that the words are about , coming out of the tele@@ vi@@ sion fe@@ e@@ ds ; you &apos;ve got the conversa@@ tions that are about those to@@ pic@@ s ; and through seman@@ tic anal@@ y@@ sis — and this is actually real data you &apos;re looking at from our data pro@@ ces@@ sing — each y@@ el@@ low line is sho@@ wing a lin@@ k being made between a com@@ ment in the w@@ il@@ d and a piece of ev@@ ent struc@@ ture coming out of the tele@@ vi@@ sion si@@ gn@@ al .
And the same idea now can be buil@@ t up .
And we get this wor@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe , ex@@ cep@@ t now words are not as@@ se@@ mb@@ led in my living room .
In@@ stead , the con@@ text , the common ground activi@@ ties , are the cont@@ ent on tele@@ vi@@ sion that &apos;s dri@@ ving the conversa@@ tions .
And what we &apos;re see@@ ing here , these sk@@ y@@ s@@ cra@@ per@@ s now , are com@@ men@@ tar@@ y that are lin@@ ked to cont@@ ent on tele@@ vi@@ sion .
Sa@@ me concep@@ t , but looking at communi@@ cation dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs in a very different s@@ ph@@ ere .
And so funda@@ ment@@ ally , ra@@ ther than , for example , meas@@ ur@@ ing cont@@ ent based on how many people are wat@@ ching , this gi@@ ves us the ba@@ sic data for looking at eng@@ ag@@ e@@ ment pro@@ per@@ ties of cont@@ ent .
And just like we can look at fe@@ e@@ d@@ back cy@@ c@@ les and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs in a family , we can now open up the same concep@@ ts and look at much lar@@ ger g@@ rou@@ ps of people .
This is a sub@@ set of data from our da@@ ta@@ base — just 5@@ 0@@ ,000 out of se@@ ver@@ al million — and the social gra@@ p@@ h that connec@@ ts them through publi@@ c@@ ly a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble s@@ our@@ ces .
And if you put them on one pla@@ in , a second pla@@ in is where the cont@@ ent lives .
So we have the progra@@ ms and the s@@ por@@ ting ev@@ ents and the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als , and all of the lin@@ k struc@@ tures that ti@@ e them together make a cont@@ ent gra@@ p@@ h .
And then the important th@@ ird di@@ men@@ sion .
E@@ ach of the lin@@ ks that you &apos;re see@@ ing ren@@ der@@ ed here is an actual connec@@ tion made between something someone said and a piece of cont@@ ent .
And there are , again , now ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of these lin@@ ks that give us the connec@@ tive tis@@ su@@ e of social gra@@ ph@@ s and how they rela@@ te to cont@@ ent .
And we can now start to pro@@ be the struc@@ ture in interesting ways .
So if we , for example , tra@@ ce the pa@@ th of one piece of cont@@ ent that dri@@ ves someone to com@@ ment on it , and then we fol@@ low where that com@@ ment goes , and then look at the entire social gra@@ p@@ h that be@@ comes activ@@ ated and then tra@@ ce back to see the rela@@ tion@@ ship between that social gra@@ p@@ h and cont@@ ent , a very interesting struc@@ ture be@@ comes vi@@ sible .
We call this a co@@ -@@ vie@@ wing cli@@ que , a virtual living room if you will .
And there are fas@@ cin@@ ating dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs at play .
It &apos;s not one way .
A piece of cont@@ ent , an ev@@ ent , caus@@ es someone to talk .
They talk to other people .
That dri@@ ves tun@@ e@@ -@@ in behavi@@ or back into ma@@ ss media , and you have these cy@@ c@@ les that dri@@ ve the over@@ all behavi@@ or .
A@@ no@@ ther example — very different — another actual person in our da@@ ta@@ base — and we &apos;re fin@@ ding at le@@ ast hundre@@ ds , if not thousands , of these .
We &apos;ve given this person a name .
This is a pro@@ -@@ ama@@ te@@ u@@ r , or pro@@ -@@ am media cri@@ tic who has this high fan@@ -@@ out rate .
So a lot of people are fol@@ lo@@ wing this person — very inf@@ lu@@ enti@@ al — and they have a pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to talk about what &apos;s on T@@ V .
So this person is a k@@ ey lin@@ k in connec@@ ting ma@@ ss media and social media together .
One last example from this data : So@@ me@@ times it &apos;s actually a piece of cont@@ ent that is spe@@ cial .
So if we go and look at this piece of cont@@ ent , P@@ res@@ id@@ ent O@@ ba@@ ma &apos;s Sta@@ te of the Uni@@ on ad@@ d@@ ress from just a few wee@@ ks ago , and look at what we find in this same data set , at the same s@@ cal@@ e , the eng@@ ag@@ e@@ ment pro@@ per@@ ties of this piece of cont@@ ent are tru@@ ly re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
A na@@ tion ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ding in conversa@@ tion in real time in respon@@ se to what &apos;s on the bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st .
And of course , through all of these lin@@ es are flo@@ wing un@@ struc@@ tu@@ red language .
We can X@@ -@@ ra@@ y and get a re@@ al@@ -@@ time pul@@ se of a na@@ tion , re@@ al@@ -@@ time sense of the social reac@@ tions in the different cir@@ cu@@ its in the social gra@@ p@@ h being activ@@ ated by cont@@ ent .
So , to su@@ mm@@ ari@@ ze , the idea is this : As our world be@@ comes incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly instru@@ men@@ ted and we have the cap@@ abili@@ ties to col@@ lec@@ t and connec@@ t the d@@ ots between what people are saying and the con@@ text they &apos;re saying it in , what &apos;s emer@@ ging is an ability to see new social struc@@ tures and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs that have pre@@ vi@@ ously not been seen .
It &apos;s like buil@@ ding a micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe or telesco@@ pe and re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing new struc@@ tures about our own behavi@@ or around communi@@ cation .
And I think the imp@@ lica@@ tions here are pro@@ found , whether it &apos;s for science , for com@@ mer@@ ce , for government , or per@@ haps most of all , for us as individu@@ als .
And so just to re@@ turn to my son , when I was pre@@ par@@ ing this talk , he was looking over my sh@@ oul@@ der , and I sho@@ w@@ ed him the cli@@ ps I was going to show to you today , and I asked him for permi@@ s@@ sion — gran@@ ted .
And then I went on to ref@@ lec@@ t , &quot; &quot; Is@@ n &apos;t it amazing , this entire da@@ ta@@ base , all these recor@@ d@@ ings , I &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your si@@ s@@ ter &quot; &quot; — who ar@@ ri@@ ved two years later — &quot; &quot; and you gu@@ ys are going to be able to go back and re@@ -@@ experience mo@@ ments that you could never , with your bio@@ logical memor@@ y , pos@@ si@@ bly remember the way you can now ? &quot; &quot; And he was qui@@ et for a moment .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What am I thinking ?
He &apos;s five years old . He &apos;s not going to understand this . &quot; &quot; And just as I was having that thought , he looked up at me and said , &quot; &quot; So that when I grow up , I can show this to my kids ? &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , this is power@@ ful stuff . &quot; &quot; So I want to lea@@ ve you with one last memor@@ able moment from our family .
This is the first time our son took more than two ste@@ ps at on@@ ce — cap@@ tu@@ red on fil@@ m .
And I really want you to fo@@ c@@ us on something as I take you through .
It &apos;s a c@@ lu@@ tter@@ ed environment ; it &apos;s natural life .
My mother &apos;s in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , co@@ o@@ king , and , of all places , in the hall@@ way , I realiz@@ e he &apos;s about to do it , about to take more than two ste@@ ps .
And so you he@@ ar me en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging him , realiz@@ ing what &apos;s happen@@ ing , and then the ma@@ gi@@ c happens .
L@@ is@@ ten very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly .
A@@ b@@ out three ste@@ ps in , he realiz@@ es something ma@@ gi@@ c is happen@@ ing , and the most amazing fe@@ e@@ d@@ back loo@@ p of all k@@ ic@@ ks in , and he takes a bre@@ ath in , and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ s &quot; &quot; w@@ ow &quot; &quot; and inst@@ inc@@ tively I e@@ ch@@ o back the same .
And so let &apos;s f@@ ly back in time to that memor@@ able moment .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ R : H@@ ey .
Co@@ me here .
C@@ an you do it ?
Oh , bo@@ y .
C@@ an you do it ?
B@@ ab@@ y : Y@@ e@@ ah .
D@@ R : M@@ a , he &apos;s wal@@ king .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) D@@ R : Thank you . ( Applause )
The ma@@ gi@@ cal moment , the ma@@ gi@@ cal moment of con@@ duc@@ ting .
Wh@@ ich is , you go on@@ to a sta@@ ge . There is an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra si@@ tting .
They are all , you know , war@@ ming up and doing stuff .
And I go on the po@@ di@@ um .
You know , this little of@@ fi@@ ce of the con@@ duc@@ tor .
O@@ r ra@@ ther a cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le , an op@@ en@@ -@@ space cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le , with a lot of space .
And in front of all that noi@@ se , you do a very small g@@ est@@ ure .
So@@ me@@ thing like this , not very po@@ m@@ p , not very so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted , this .
And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , out of the cha@@ os , order .
No@@ i@@ se be@@ comes music .
And this is fan@@ ta@@ stic . And it &apos;s so temp@@ ting to think that it &apos;s all about me .
( Laughter ) All those great people here , vir@@ tu@@ osos , they make noi@@ se , they need me to do that .
No@@ t really . If it were that , I would just sa@@ ve you the talk , and te@@ ach you the g@@ est@@ ure .
So you could go out to the world and do this thing in w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver comp@@ any or w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you want , and you have perfec@@ t har@@ mon@@ y . It doesn &apos;t work .
Let &apos;s look at the first video .
I hope you &apos;ll think it &apos;s a good example of har@@ mon@@ y .
And then spe@@ ak a little bit about how it comes about .
( Music ) W@@ as that n@@ ice ?
So that was a sort of a suc@@ cess .
Now , who should we th@@ ank for the suc@@ cess ?
I mean , obvi@@ ously the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans pla@@ ying beauti@@ ful@@ ly , the Vi@@ en@@ na P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic O@@ r@@ ch@@ est@@ ra .
They don &apos;t of@@ ten even look at the con@@ duc@@ tor .
Then you have the cla@@ p@@ ping audi@@ ence , ye@@ ah , actually taking part in doing the music .
You know Vi@@ en@@ n@@ ese audi@@ ences us@@ u@@ ally don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere with the music .
This is the clo@@ s@@ est to an O@@ ri@@ en@@ tal be@@ ll@@ y@@ dan@@ c@@ ing fe@@ ast that you will ever get in Vi@@ en@@ na .
( Laughter ) Un@@ like , for example Isra@@ el , where audi@@ ences cou@@ gh all the time .
You know , Ar@@ th@@ u@@ r R@@ u@@ bin@@ ste@@ in , the pi@@ an@@ ist , used to say that , &quot; &quot; An@@ y@@ where in the world , people that have the fl@@ u , they go to the doc@@ tor .
In T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v they come to my con@@ cer@@ ts . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s a sort of a tradi@@ tion .
But Vi@@ en@@ n@@ ese audi@@ ences do not do that .
Here they go out of their regu@@ lar , just to be part of that , to become part of the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra , and that &apos;s great .
You know , audi@@ ences like you , ye@@ ah , make the ev@@ ent .
But what about the con@@ duc@@ tor ? What can you say the con@@ duc@@ tor was doing , actually ?
U@@ m , he was happ@@ y .
And I of@@ ten show this to sen@@ i@@ or man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment .
People get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed .
&quot; You come to work . How come you &apos;re so happ@@ y ? &quot;
So@@ me@@ thing must be wrong there , ye@@ ah ? But he &apos;s s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing happ@@ in@@ ess .
And I think the happ@@ in@@ ess , the important thing is this happ@@ in@@ ess does not come from only his own story and his jo@@ y of the music .
The jo@@ y is about en@@ ab@@ ling other people &apos;s stories to be heard at the same time .
You have the story of the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra as a profes@@ sion@@ al body .
You have the story of the audi@@ ence as a commun@@ ity . Y@@ e@@ ah .
You have the stories of the individu@@ als in the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra and in the audi@@ ence .
And then you have other stories , un@@ seen .
People who build this wonderful con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all .
People who made those S@@ tradi@@ vari@@ us , A@@ ma@@ ti , all those beautiful instru@@ ments .
And all those stories are being heard at the same time .
This is the true experience of a live con@@ cer@@ t .
That &apos;s a reason to go out of home . Y@@ e@@ ah ?
And not all con@@ duc@@ tors do just that .
Let &apos;s see somebody else , a great con@@ duc@@ tor .
R@@ ic@@ car@@ do Mu@@ ti , ple@@ ase .
( Music ) Y@@ e@@ ah , that was very sh@@ or@@ t , but you could see it &apos;s a comple@@ tely different figur@@ e . R@@ ight ?
He &apos;s aw@@ es@@ o@@ me . He &apos;s so com@@ man@@ ding . Y@@ e@@ ah ?
So c@@ lear . Ma@@ ybe a little bit over@@ -@@ c@@ lear .
C@@ an we have a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion ? W@@ ould you be my or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra for a second ?
C@@ an you sing , ple@@ ase , the first n@@ ote of D@@ on Gi@@ o@@ van@@ n@@ i ?
You have to sing &quot; &quot; A@@ aa@@ aa@@ ah , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ll stop you .
Okay ? Re@@ ad@@ y ?
Au@@ di@@ ence : ♫ A@@ aa@@ aa@@ a@@ ah ... ♫ I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ ga@@ m : Co@@ me on , with me . If you do it without me I feel even more re@@ d@@ und@@ ant than I already feel .
So ple@@ ase , wa@@ it for the con@@ duc@@ tor .
Now look at me . &quot; &quot; A@@ aa@@ aa@@ ah , &quot; &quot; and I stop you . Let &apos;s go .
Au@@ di@@ ence : ♫ ... A@@ aa@@ aa@@ aa@@ ah ... ♫ ( Laughter ) I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ ga@@ m : So we &apos;ll have a little ch@@ at later . ( Laughter )
But ... There is a vac@@ an@@ cy for a ...
But — ( Laughter ) — you could see that you could stop an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra with a f@@ ing@@ er .
Now what does R@@ ic@@ car@@ do Mu@@ ti do ? He does something like this ...
( Laughter ) And then — sort of — ( Laughter ) So not only the in@@ struc@@ tion is c@@ lear , but also the san@@ c@@ tion , what will happen if you don &apos;t do what I tell you . ( Laughter )
So , does it work ? Y@@ es , it works — to a cer@@ tain point .
When Mu@@ ti is asked , &quot; &quot; Why do you con@@ duc@@ t like this ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m respon@@ sible . &quot; &quot; R@@ es@@ pon@@ sible in front of him .
No he doesn &apos;t really mean H@@ i@@ m . He means Mo@@ z@@ art , which is — ( Laughter ) — like a th@@ ird se@@ at from the cen@@ ter . ( Laughter )
So he says , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m — ( Applause ) if I &apos;m respon@@ sible for Mo@@ z@@ art , this is going to be the only story to be told .
It &apos;s Mo@@ z@@ art as I , R@@ ic@@ car@@ do Mu@@ ti , understand it . &quot; &quot; And you know what happened to Mu@@ ti ?
Th@@ ree years ago he got a le@@ tter si@@ g@@ ned by all 7@@ 00 emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es of L@@ a S@@ cal@@ a , mu@@ si@@ cal emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , I mean the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a great con@@ duc@@ tor . We don &apos;t want to work with you . P@@ le@@ ase res@@ ig@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Why ? Because you don &apos;t let us develo@@ p .
You &apos;re using us as instru@@ ments , not as par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
And our jo@@ y of music , et@@ c . , et@@ c . ... &quot; &quot; So he had to res@@ ig@@ n . Is@@ n &apos;t that n@@ ice ?
( Laughter ) He &apos;s a n@@ ice guy . He &apos;s a really n@@ ice guy .
Well , can you do it with less control , or with a different kind of control ?
Let &apos;s look at the next con@@ duc@@ tor , R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard S@@ tra@@ us@@ s .
( Music ) I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;ll get the fe@@ el@@ ing that I really pic@@ ked on him because he &apos;s old .
It &apos;s not true . When he was a young man of about 30 , he w@@ r@@ ote what he called &quot; The Ten Co@@ m@@ man@@ d@@ ments for Con@@ duc@@ tors . &quot;
The first one was : If you s@@ we@@ at by the end of the con@@ cer@@ t it means that you must have done something wrong .
That &apos;s the first one . The f@@ our@@ th one you &apos;ll like better .
It says : N@@ ever look at the tro@@ mb@@ ones — it only en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges them .
( Laughter ) So , the whole idea is really to let it happen by it@@ self .
D@@ o not inter@@ f@@ ere .
But how does it happen ? D@@ id you see him tur@@ ning pa@@ ges in the s@@ co@@ re ?
Now , ei@@ ther he is sen@@ i@@ le , and doesn &apos;t remember his own music , because he w@@ r@@ ote the music .
O@@ r he is actually trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing a very st@@ rong mes@@ sa@@ ge to them , saying , &quot; &quot; Co@@ me on gu@@ ys . You have to play by the book .
So it &apos;s not about my story . It &apos;s not about your story .
It &apos;s only the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion of the wri@@ t@@ ten music , no inter@@ pre@@ tation . &quot; &quot; Inter@@ pre@@ tation is the real story of the per@@ for@@ m@@ er .
So , no , he doesn &apos;t want that . That &apos;s a different kind of control .
Let &apos;s see another super@@ -@@ con@@ duc@@ tor , a G@@ er@@ man super@@ -@@ con@@ duc@@ tor . H@@ er@@ ber@@ t v@@ on K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an , ple@@ ase .
( Music ) What &apos;s different ? D@@ id you see the eyes ? C@@ lo@@ sed .
D@@ id you see the han@@ ds ?
D@@ id you see this kind of mo@@ ve@@ ment ? Let me con@@ duc@@ t you . T@@ w@@ ice .
O@@ n@@ ce like a Mu@@ ti , and you &apos;ll — ( C@@ la@@ ps ) — cla@@ p , just on@@ ce .
And then like K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an . Let &apos;s see what happens . Okay ?
Li@@ ke Mu@@ ti . You ready ? Because Mu@@ ti ...
( Laughter ) Okay ? Re@@ ad@@ y ? Let &apos;s do it .
Au@@ di@@ ence : ( C@@ la@@ ps ) I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ ga@@ m : H@@ m@@ m ... again . Au@@ di@@ ence : ( C@@ la@@ ps )
I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ ga@@ m : G@@ o@@ od . Now like a K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an . S@@ in@@ ce you &apos;re already tra@@ in@@ ed , let me con@@ cent@@ rate , clo@@ se my eyes . Co@@ me , come .
Au@@ di@@ ence : ( C@@ la@@ ps ) ( Laughter ) I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ ga@@ m : Why not together ? ( Laughter ) Because you didn &apos;t know when to play .
Now I can tell you , even the B@@ er@@ li@@ n P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic doesn &apos;t know when to play .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;ll tell you how they do it . No cy@@ ni@@ ci@@ s@@ m .
This is a G@@ er@@ man or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra , y@@ es ?
They look at K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an . And then they look at each other .
( Laughter ) &quot; D@@ o you understand what this guy wan@@ ts ? &quot;
And after doing that , they really look at each other , and the first play@@ ers of the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra le@@ ad the whole en@@ se@@ m@@ ble in pla@@ ying together .
And when K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an is asked about it he actually says , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , the wor@@ st da@@ ma@@ ge I can do to my or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra is to give them a c@@ lear in@@ struc@@ tion .
Because that would pre@@ v@@ ent the en@@ se@@ m@@ ble , the listen@@ ing to each other that is nee@@ ded for an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra . &quot; &quot; Now that &apos;s great . What about the eyes ?
Why are the eyes clo@@ sed ?
There is a wonderful story about K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an con@@ duc@@ ting in L@@ on@@ don .
And he cu@@ es in a f@@ lu@@ te play@@ er like this .
The guy has no idea what to do . ( Laughter ) &quot; Ma@@ estr@@ o , with all du@@ e res@@ pec@@ t , when should I start ? &quot;
What do you think K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an &apos;s re@@ p@@ ly was ? When should I start ?
Oh ye@@ ah . He says , &quot; &quot; You start when you can &apos;t st@@ and it any@@ more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) M@@ e@@ an@@ ing that you know you have no au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to change anything .
It &apos;s my music . The real music is only in K@@ ar@@ aj@@ an &apos;s head .
And you have to gu@@ ess my mind . So you are under tre@@ men@@ dous pres@@ sure because I don &apos;t give you in@@ struc@@ tion , and yet , you have to gu@@ ess my mind .
So it &apos;s a different kind of , a very spi@@ ri@@ tual but yet very fir@@ m control .
C@@ an we do it in another way ? O@@ f course we can . Let &apos;s go back to the first con@@ duc@@ tor we &apos;ve seen : Car@@ los K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er , his name . N@@ ext video , ple@@ ase .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) Y@@ e@@ ah .
Well , it is different . But isn &apos;t that contro@@ lling in the same way ?
No , it &apos;s not , because he is not telling them what to do .
When he does this , it &apos;s not , &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke your S@@ tradi@@ vari@@ us and like J@@ im@@ i H@@ en@@ dri@@ x , s@@ ma@@ sh it on the flo@@ or . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not that .
He says , &quot; &quot; This is the g@@ est@@ ure of the music .
I &apos;m op@@ en@@ ing a space for you to put in another la@@ y@@ er of inter@@ pre@@ tation . &quot; &quot; That is another story .
But how does it really work together if it doesn &apos;t give them in@@ struc@@ tions ?
It &apos;s like being on a ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter . Y@@ e@@ ah ?
You &apos;re not really given any in@@ struc@@ tions , but the for@@ ces of the process it@@ self keep you in place .
That &apos;s what he does .
The interesting thing is of course the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter does not really exis@@ t .
It &apos;s not a physical thing . It &apos;s in the play@@ ers &apos; he@@ ads .
And that &apos;s what makes them into par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
You have the pla@@ n in your head .
You know what to do , even though K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er is not con@@ duc@@ ting you .
But here and there and that . You know what to do .
And you become a par@@ t@@ ner buil@@ ding the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter , ye@@ ah , with sound , as you actually take the ri@@ de .
This is very exci@@ ting for those play@@ ers .
They do need to go to a san@@ atori@@ um for two wee@@ ks , later .
( Laughter ) It is very ti@@ r@@ ing . Y@@ e@@ ah ?
But it &apos;s the best music making , like this .
But of course it &apos;s not only about mo@@ tiv@@ ation and gi@@ ving them a lot of physical energy .
You also have to be very profes@@ sion@@ al .
And look again at this K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er .
C@@ an we have the next video , qu@@ ick@@ ly ?
You &apos;ll see what happens when there is a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
( Music ) A@@ ga@@ in you see the beautiful body language . ( Music )
And now there is a tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t play@@ er who does something not exactly the way it should be done .
G@@ o al@@ ong with the video . L@@ oo@@ k .
Se@@ e , second time for the same play@@ er .
( Laughter ) And now the th@@ ird time for the same play@@ er . ( Laughter )
&quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it for me after the con@@ cer@@ t .
I have a sh@@ or@@ t no@@ tice to give you . &quot; &quot; You know , when it &apos;s nee@@ ded , the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity is there . It &apos;s very important .
But au@@ th@@ or@@ ity is not enough to make people your par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
Let &apos;s see the next video , ple@@ ase . Se@@ e what happens here .
You might be sur@@ pri@@ sed having seen K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er as such a hy@@ per@@ ac@@ tive guy .
He &apos;s con@@ duc@@ ting Mo@@ z@@ art .
( Music ) The whole or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra is pla@@ ying . ( Music )
Now something else . ( Music )
Se@@ e ? He is there 100 percent , but not com@@ man@@ ding , not telling what to do .
R@@ a@@ ther en@@ jo@@ ying what the so@@ lo@@ ist is doing .
( Music ) A@@ no@@ ther so@@ lo now . Se@@ e what you can pic@@ k up from this . ( Music )
L@@ oo@@ k at the eyes .
Okay . You see that ?
F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a kind of a comp@@ li@@ ment we all like to get .
It &apos;s not fe@@ e@@ d@@ back . It &apos;s an &quot; &quot; M@@ mm@@ m ... &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it comes from here .
So that &apos;s a good thing .
And the second thing is it &apos;s about actually being in control , but in a very spe@@ cial way .
When K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er does — did you see the eyes , going from here ? ( S@@ ing@@ ing ) You know what happens ? Gra@@ vi@@ tation is no more .
K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er not only cre@@ ates a process , but also cre@@ ates the condi@@ tions in the world in which this process takes place .
So again , the o@@ bo@@ e play@@ er is comple@@ tely au@@ ton@@ o@@ mous and ther@@ e@@ fore happ@@ y and pro@@ u@@ d of his work , and crea@@ tive and all of that .
And the level in which K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er is in control is in a different level .
So control is no lon@@ ger a z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ su@@ m game .
You have this control . You have this control . And all you put together , in par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship , br@@ ings about the best music .
So K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er is about process .
K@@ le@@ i@@ b@@ er is about condi@@ tions in the world .
But you need to have process and cont@@ ent to create the me@@ an@@ ing .
L@@ en@@ ny B@@ er@@ n@@ ste@@ in , my own person@@ al ma@@ estr@@ o .
S@@ in@@ ce he was a great teach@@ er , L@@ en@@ ny B@@ er@@ n@@ ste@@ in always started from the me@@ an@@ ing . L@@ oo@@ k at this , ple@@ ase .
( Music ) D@@ o you remember the face of Mu@@ ti , at the beg@@ in@@ ning ?
Well he had a wonderful expres@@ sion , but only one .
( Laughter ) D@@ id you see L@@ en@@ ny &apos;s face ?
You know why ? Because the me@@ an@@ ing of the music is pa@@ in .
And you &apos;re pla@@ ying a pa@@ in@@ ful sound .
And you look at L@@ en@@ ny and he &apos;s suf@@ fer@@ ing .
But not in a way that you want to stop .
It &apos;s suf@@ fer@@ ing , like , en@@ jo@@ ying hi@@ m@@ self in a J@@ e@@ wis@@ h way , as they say .
( Laughter ) But you can see the music on his face .
You can see the bat@@ on left his hand . No more bat@@ on .
Now it &apos;s about you , the play@@ er , telling the story .
Now it &apos;s a re@@ ver@@ sed thing . You &apos;re telling the story . And you &apos;re telling the story .
And even bri@@ ef@@ ly , you become the stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ er to which the commun@@ ity , the whole commun@@ ity , list@@ ens to .
And B@@ er@@ n@@ ste@@ in en@@ ab@@ les that . Is@@ n &apos;t that wonderful ?
Now , if you are doing all the things we tal@@ ked about , together , and maybe some others , you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing .
And for the last video , I think this is simply the best ti@@ t@@ le .
My fri@@ end Pe@@ ter says , &quot; &quot; If you love something , give it away . &quot; &quot; So , ple@@ ase .
( Music ) ( Applause )
When I was only three or four , I f@@ ell in love with poe@@ try , with the r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms and the music of language ; with the power of meta@@ ph@@ or and of imag@@ er@@ y , poe@@ try being the es@@ sen@@ ce of communi@@ cation — the dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , the di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation .
And all these years later , the poe@@ ms I &apos;ll read today are from my j@@ u@@ st@@ -@@ fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed se@@ v@@ ent@@ h book of poe@@ try .
Well , five years ago , I was diagno@@ sed with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease .
Th@@ ough there &apos;s no cur@@ e yet , ad@@ van@@ ces in tre@@ at@@ ment are really imp@@ res@@ sive .
But you can imagine that I was ap@@ pal@@ led to learn that wo@@ men are lar@@ ge@@ ly left out of research tri@@ als , des@@ pi@@ te gen@@ der@@ -@@ speci@@ fic medical fin@@ d@@ ings having de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted that we are not actually just small men — ( Laughter ) who happen to have different re@@ produc@@ tive syste@@ ms .
But you br@@ ing to a cri@@ sis the person you already are , inclu@@ ding the , y@@ es , mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m that you &apos;ve learned to in@@ vo@@ ke through pas@@ sion@@ ate car@@ ing and through ac@@ tion , both of which re@@ qui@@ re but also create energy .
So as an activi@@ st , I beg@@ an working with the Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s D@@ i@@ se@@ ase Fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion — that &apos;s p@@ d@@ f@@ .@@ or@@ g — to create a ma@@ j@@ or ini@@ ti@@ a@@ tive to put wo@@ men on the Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease ma@@ p .
And as a po@@ et , I beg@@ an working with this sub@@ ject matter , fin@@ ding it tra@@ gi@@ c , h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous , sometimes even jo@@ y@@ ful .
I do not feel di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ed by Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s ; I feel di@@ sti@@ l@@ led by it , and I actually very much like the woman I &apos;m di@@ sti@@ lling into .
&quot; No S@@ ig@@ ns of S@@ tru@@ gg@@ le &quot; G@@ ro@@ wing small re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es enor@@ mi@@ ty of will : just si@@ tting still in the doc@@ tor &apos;s wa@@ it@@ ing room wat@@ ching the future s@@ hu@@ f@@ f@@ le in and out , wat@@ ching it st@@ oo@@ p ; st@@ are at you while you try not to look .

L@@ ess is not always more .
Y@@ et in this emp@@ t@@ ying space , space gli@@ mm@@ ers , be@@ coming vi@@ sible .
Here is a place be@@ hind the eyes of those ac@@ cu@@ sto@@ med by what some would call di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
It is a place of mer@@ ci@@ less poe@@ try , a gi@@ ft of pres@@ ence pre@@ vi@@ ously ig@@ no@@ red , dro@@ w@@ ned in the da@@ i@@ ly c@@ lu@@ tter .

F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en years ago , it was w@@ ide@@ ly as@@ su@@ med that the v@@ ast ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of brain develo@@ p@@ ment takes place in the first few years of life .
B@@ ack then , 15 years ago , we didn &apos;t have the ability to look inside the living human brain and tra@@ ck develo@@ p@@ ment across the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
And we also use func@@ tional M@@ R@@ I , called f@@ M@@ R@@ I , to take a video , a mo@@ vi@@ e , of brain activi@@ ty when partici@@ pan@@ ts are taking part in some kind of tas@@ k like thinking or fe@@ el@@ ing or per@@ ce@@ i@@ ving something .
So adol@@ escen@@ ce is defin@@ ed as the peri@@ od of life that star@@ ts with the bio@@ logical , hormon@@ al , physical chan@@ ges of pu@@ ber@@ ty and ends at the age at which an individu@@ al at@@ ta@@ ins a sta@@ ble , in@@ depen@@ d@@ ent ro@@ le in socie@@ ty .
( Laughter ) It can go on a long time . ( Laughter ) One of the brain re@@ gi@@ ons that chan@@ ges most dra@@ ma@@ tically dur@@ ing adol@@ escen@@ ce is called pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex .
So this is a mode@@ l of the human brain , and this is pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex , right at the front .
Pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex is an interesting brain are@@ a .
So M@@ R@@ I stu@@ dies looking at the develo@@ p@@ ment of this re@@ gi@@ on have sho@@ wn that it really under@@ goes dra@@ ma@@ tic develo@@ p@@ ment dur@@ ing the peri@@ od of adol@@ escen@@ ce .
So if you look at gra@@ y matter volu@@ me , for example , gra@@ y matter volu@@ me across age from age four to 2@@ 2 years incre@@ ases dur@@ ing chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , which is what you can see on this gra@@ p@@ h . It pe@@ a@@ ks in early adol@@ escen@@ ce .
The ar@@ ro@@ ws indi@@ cate pe@@ ak gra@@ y matter volu@@ me in pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex . You can see that that pe@@ ak happens a cou@@ ple of years later in bo@@ ys rela@@ tive to gir@@ ls , and that &apos;s probably because bo@@ ys go through pu@@ ber@@ ty a cou@@ ple of years later than gir@@ ls on a@@ ver@@ age , and then dur@@ ing adol@@ escen@@ ce , there &apos;s a signifi@@ can@@ t de@@ c@@ line in gra@@ y matter volu@@ me in pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex .
This is a really important process . It &apos;s par@@ tly depen@@ d@@ ent on the environment that the animal or the human is in , and the sy@@ na@@ p@@ ses that are being used are str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ed , and sy@@ na@@ p@@ ses that ar@@ en &apos;t being used in that particular environment are pr@@ un@@ ed away .
You can think of it a bit like pr@@ un@@ ing a ro@@ se@@ bus@@ h .
You pr@@ un@@ e away the we@@ a@@ ker br@@ an@@ ches so that the rema@@ in@@ ing , important br@@ an@@ ches , can grow st@@ ron@@ ger , and this process , which effec@@ tively fin@@ e@@ -@@ tun@@ es brain tis@@ su@@ e ac@@ cor@@ ding to the speci@@ es@@ -@@ speci@@ fic environment , is happen@@ ing in pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex and in other brain re@@ gi@@ ons dur@@ ing the peri@@ od of human adol@@ escen@@ ce .
So a second line of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y that we use to tra@@ ck chan@@ ges in the adol@@ es@@ cent brain is using func@@ tional M@@ R@@ I to look at chan@@ ges in brain activi@@ ty across age .
So in my lab , we &apos;re interes@@ ted in the social brain , that is the ne@@ t@@ work of brain re@@ gi@@ ons that we use to understand other people and to interac@@ t with other people .
So I like to show a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h of a so@@ c@@ cer game to ill@@ u@@ stra@@ te two as@@ pec@@ ts of how your social bra@@ ins work .
and I think they &apos;re on the wrong end of the sta@@ di@@ um , and they &apos;re doing another social emo@@ tional respon@@ se that we all in@@ stan@@ tly recogni@@ ze , and that &apos;s the second as@@ pec@@ t of the social brain that this picture really n@@ ic@@ e@@ ly ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tes , how good we are at read@@ ing other people &apos;s behavi@@ or , their ac@@ tions , their g@@ est@@ ur@@ es , their fa@@ cial expres@@ si@@ ons , in ter@@ ms of their under@@ l@@ ying emo@@ tions and mental sta@@ tes .
So you don &apos;t have to ask any of these gu@@ ys .
You have a pretty good idea of what they &apos;re fe@@ el@@ ing and thinking at this preci@@ se moment in time .
So in my lab , we br@@ ing adol@@ esc@@ ents and adul@@ ts into the lab to have a brain s@@ can , we give them some kind of tas@@ k that invol@@ ves thinking about other people , their min@@ ds , their mental sta@@ tes , their emo@@ tions , and one of the fin@@ d@@ ings that we &apos;ve found se@@ ver@@ al times now , as have other la@@ b@@ s around the world , is part of the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex called medi@@ al pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex , which is sho@@ wn in blue on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s right in the mi@@ d@@ dle of pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex in the mi@@ d@@ line of your head .
And we think that might be because adol@@ esc@@ ents and adul@@ ts use a different mental appro@@ ach , a different co@@ gni@@ tive stra@@ te@@ gy , to make social deci@@ si@@ ons , and one way of looking at that is to do behavi@@ or@@ al stu@@ dies wh@@ er@@ e@@ by we br@@ ing people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavi@@ or@@ al tas@@ k , and I &apos;ll just give you another example of the kind of tas@@ k that we use in my lab .
So imagine that you &apos;re the partici@@ p@@ ant in one of our experi@@ ments . You come into the lab , you see this compu@@ teri@@ zed tas@@ k .
In this tas@@ k , you see a set of sh@@ el@@ ves .
Now , there are ob@@ jects on these sh@@ el@@ ves , on some of them , and you &apos;ll no@@ tice there &apos;s a guy stan@@ ding be@@ hind the set of sh@@ el@@ ves , and there are some ob@@ jects that he can &apos;t see .
They &apos;re oc@@ c@@ lu@@ ded , from his point of vie@@ w , with a kind of gra@@ y piece of wo@@ od .
This is the same set of sh@@ el@@ ves from his point of vie@@ w .
No@@ tice that there are only some ob@@ jects that he can see , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as there are many more ob@@ jects that you can see .
Now your tas@@ k is to move ob@@ jects around .
They move the whi@@ te tr@@ uc@@ k instead of the blue tr@@ uc@@ k .
We tell them , o@@ kay , we &apos;re going to do exactly the same thing but this time there &apos;s no direc@@ tor . In@@ stead you &apos;ve got to ig@@ nor@@ e ob@@ jects with the dar@@ k gra@@ y bac@@ k@@ ground .
But it &apos;s when you compar@@ e the last two g@@ rou@@ ps , the mi@@ d-@@ adol@@ es@@ cent gro@@ up and the adul@@ t gro@@ up where things get really interesting , because there , there is no continu@@ ed impro@@ ve@@ ment in the no@@ -@@ direc@@ tor condi@@ tion .
So we sometimes la@@ u@@ gh about te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers .
They &apos;re par@@ o@@ died , sometimes even de@@ mon@@ i@@ zed in the media for their kind of ty@@ pi@@ cal te@@ en@@ age behavi@@ or . They take ris@@ ks , they &apos;re sometimes mo@@ o@@ dy , they &apos;re very sel@@ f-@@ consci@@ ous .
( Laughter ) The very no@@ tion of their da@@ d sing@@ ing in publi@@ c was enough to make them be@@ have .
So people of@@ ten ask , &quot; &quot; Well , is adol@@ escen@@ ce a kind of rec@@ ent ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on ?
I@@ s it something we &apos;ve in@@ ven@@ ted rec@@ ently in the W@@ est ? &quot; &quot; And actually , the answer is probably not . There are l@@ ots of descri@@ p@@ tions of adol@@ escen@@ ce in hist@@ ory that sound very similar to the descri@@ p@@ tions we use today .
So there &apos;s a fa@@ mous quot@@ e by S@@ ha@@ k@@ espe@@ are from &quot; &quot; The W@@ in@@ ter &apos;s Tal@@ e &quot; &quot; where he descri@@ b@@ es adol@@ escen@@ ce as fol@@ lo@@ ws : &quot; &quot; I would there were no age between ten and th@@ ree@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ tw@@ ent@@ y , or that y@@ outh would s@@ le@@ ep out the res@@ t ; for there is nothing in the between but getting w@@ en@@ ches with child , w@@ ron@@ ging the an@@ ci@@ entr@@ y , ste@@ al@@ ing , fi@@ gh@@ ting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He then goes on to say , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ving said that , would any but these bo@@ i@@ led bra@@ ins of n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en and tw@@ o@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ tw@@ ent@@ y hun@@ t in this we@@ a@@ ther ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So almost 4@@ 00 years ago , S@@ ha@@ k@@ espe@@ are was por@@ tra@@ ying adol@@ esc@@ ents in a very similar light to the light that we por@@ tra@@ y them in today , but today we try to understand
So for example , take ris@@ k@@ -@@ taking . We know that adol@@ esc@@ ents have a ten@@ den@@ cy to take ris@@ ks . They do .
They take more ris@@ ks than children or adul@@ ts , and they are partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly pro@@ ne to taking ris@@ ks when they &apos;re with their fri@@ ends . There &apos;s an important dri@@ ve to become in@@ depen@@ d@@ ent from one &apos;s parents and to imp@@ ress one &apos;s fri@@ ends in adol@@ escen@@ ce .
So the li@@ mbi@@ c system is right de@@ ep inside the brain , and it &apos;s invol@@ ved in things like emo@@ tion pro@@ ces@@ sing and re@@ ward pro@@ ces@@ sing . It gi@@ ves you the re@@ war@@ ding fe@@ el@@ ing out of doing f@@ un things , inclu@@ ding taking ris@@ ks .
It gi@@ ves you the k@@ ick out of taking ris@@ ks .
And this re@@ gi@@ on , the re@@ gi@@ ons within the li@@ mbi@@ c system , have been found to be hy@@ per@@ sen@@ si@@ tive to the re@@ war@@ ding fe@@ el@@ ing of ris@@ k@@ -@@ taking in adol@@ esc@@ ents compar@@ ed with adul@@ ts , and at the very same time , the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex , which you can see in blue in the sli@@ de here , which st@@ op@@ s us taking ex@@ ces@@ sive ris@@ ks , is still very much in develo@@ p@@ ment in adol@@ esc@@ ents .
So brain research has sho@@ wn that the adol@@ es@@ cent brain under@@ goes really quite pro@@ found develo@@ p@@ ment , and this has imp@@ lica@@ tions for education , for re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation , and inter@@ ven@@ tion . The environment , inclu@@ ding teach@@ ing , can and does s@@ hap@@ e the develo@@ ping adol@@ es@@ cent brain , and yet it &apos;s only rela@@ tively rec@@ ently that we have been rou@@ tin@@ e@@ ly edu@@ ca@@ ting te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers in the W@@ est .
All four of my gran@@ d@@ parents , for example , left school in their early adol@@ escen@@ ce . They had no cho@@ ice .
And that &apos;s still the case for many , many te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers around the world today . F@@ or@@ ty percent of te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to secon@@ dar@@ y school education .
And yet , this is a peri@@ od of life where the brain is partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ada@@ p@@ table and mal@@ le@@ able .
It &apos;s a fan@@ ta@@ stic op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for learning and crea@@ tivi@@ ty .
So what &apos;s sometimes seen as the problem with adol@@ esc@@ ents — he@@ i@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed ris@@ k@@ -@@ taking , po@@ or imp@@ ul@@ se control , sel@@ f-@@ consci@@ ousness — sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be sti@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ zed .
It actually ref@@ lec@@ ts chan@@ ges in the brain that pro@@ vi@@ de an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for education and social develo@@ p@@ ment . Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks ago I was in my stu@@ dio in Par@@ is , and the ph@@ one ran@@ g and I heard , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , J@@ R , you w@@ on the TED Pri@@ ze 20@@ 1@@ 1 .
You have to make a wis@@ h to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; I was lost .
I mean , I can &apos;t sa@@ ve the world . No@@ body can .
The world is f@@ uc@@ ked up .
Co@@ me on , you have dic@@ ta@@ tors r@@ ul@@ ing the world , population is gro@@ wing by mi@@ llions , there &apos;s no more fish in the sea , the Nor@@ th Po@@ le is mel@@ ting and as the last TED Pri@@ ze win@@ ner said , we &apos;re all be@@ coming f@@ at .
( Laughter ) Ex@@ cep@@ t maybe F@@ ren@@ ch people .
W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver .
So I called back and I told her , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , A@@ my , tell the TED gu@@ ys I just w@@ on &apos;t show up .
I can &apos;t do anything to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , J@@ R , your wis@@ h is not to sa@@ ve the world , but to change the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; That &apos;s co@@ ol . &quot;
I mean , technology , poli@@ tics , bus@@ in@@ ess do change the world — not always in a good way , but they do .
What about art ?
C@@ ould art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
And at that time , I was not thinking about chan@@ ging the world .
I was doing gra@@ f@@ f@@ it@@ i — wri@@ ting my name every@@ where , using the city as a can@@ v@@ as .
I was going in the tun@@ n@@ els of Par@@ is , on the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps with my fri@@ ends .
E@@ ach tri@@ p was an ex@@ cur@@ sion , was an ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure .
It was like lea@@ ving our mar@@ k on socie@@ ty , to say , &quot; &quot; I was here , &quot; &quot; on the top of a buil@@ ding .
So when I found a che@@ a@@ p cam@@ era on the sub@@ way , I started do@@ cu@@ men@@ ting those ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es with my fri@@ ends and ga@@ ve them back as phot@@ o@@ co@@ pi@@ es — really small phot@@ os just that size .
That &apos;s how , at 1@@ 7 years old , I started pa@@ st@@ ing them .
And I did my first &quot; &quot; ex@@ po de ru@@ e , &quot; &quot; which means si@@ de@@ wal@@ k gal@@ ler@@ y .
And I fra@@ med it with col@@ or so you would not con@@ f@@ use it with ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
I mean , the city &apos;s the best gal@@ ler@@ y I could imagine .
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gal@@ ler@@ y and let them deci@@ de if my work was n@@ ice enough to show it to people .
I would control it direc@@ tly with the publi@@ c in the st@@ ree@@ ts .
So that &apos;s Par@@ is .
I would change — depen@@ ding on the places I would go — the ti@@ t@@ le of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
That &apos;s on the C@@ ha@@ mp@@ s@@ -@@ E@@ l@@ y@@ se@@ es .
I was quite pro@@ u@@ d of that one .
Because I was just 1@@ 8 and I was just up there on the top of the C@@ ha@@ mp@@ s@@ -@@ E@@ l@@ y@@ se@@ es .
Then when the p@@ ho@@ to left , the fra@@ me was still there .
( Laughter ) No@@ ve@@ mber 200@@ 5 : the st@@ ree@@ ts are bur@@ ning .
A lar@@ ge wa@@ ve of ri@@ ots had bro@@ ken into the first pro@@ jects of Par@@ is .
E@@ very@@ one was g@@ lu@@ ed to the T@@ V , wat@@ ching dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing imag@@ es ta@@ ken from the e@@ dge of the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
I mean , these kids , without control , th@@ ro@@ wing M@@ ol@@ ot@@ o@@ v co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il@@ s , at@@ tac@@ king the co@@ ps and the fi@@ re@@ men , lo@@ ot@@ ing everything they could in the sho@@ ps .
These were cri@@ min@@ als , th@@ u@@ gs , dan@@ ger@@ ous , dest@@ ro@@ ying their own environment .
And then I saw it — could it be possible ? — my p@@ ho@@ to on a w@@ all re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by a bur@@ ning car — a pa@@ st@@ ing I &apos;d done a year ear@@ li@@ er — an il@@ le@@ g@@ al one — still there .
I mean , these were the fac@@ es of my fri@@ ends .
I know those gu@@ ys .
All of them are not an@@ g@@ els , but they &apos;re not mon@@ st@@ ers ei@@ ther .
So it was kind of we@@ ird to see those imag@@ es and those eyes st@@ are back at me through a tele@@ vi@@ sion .
So I went back there with a 2@@ 8 m@@ m len@@ s .
It was the only one I had at that time .
But with that len@@ s , you have to be as clo@@ se as 10 in@@ ches from the person .
So you can do it only with their tr@@ ust .
So I took full por@@ tra@@ its of people from L@@ e Bo@@ s@@ qu@@ et .
They were making s@@ car@@ y fac@@ es to play the car@@ i@@ ca@@ ture of themselves .
And then I pas@@ ted hu@@ ge pos@@ ters every@@ where in the b@@ our@@ ge@@ o@@ is are@@ a of Par@@ is with the name , age , even buil@@ ding number of these gu@@ ys .
A year later , the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion was dis@@ play@@ ed in front of the city h@@ all of Par@@ is .
And we go from th@@ u@@ g imag@@ es , who &apos;ve been st@@ ol@@ en and dist@@ or@@ ted by the media , who &apos;s now pro@@ ud@@ ly taking over his own ima@@ ge .
That &apos;s where I realiz@@ ed the power of pa@@ per and g@@ lue .
So could art change the world ?
A year later , I was listen@@ ing to all the noi@@ se about the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
I mean , at that time , tr@@ ust me , they were only re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to the Isra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
So with my fri@@ end Mar@@ co , we decided to go there and see who are the real P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ ans and who are the real Isra@@ el@@ is .
A@@ re they so different ?
When we got there , we just went in the stre@@ et , started talking with people every@@ where , and we realiz@@ ed that things were a bit different from the r@@ he@@ tori@@ c we heard in the media .
So we decided to take por@@ tra@@ its of P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ ans and Isra@@ el@@ is doing the same j@@ ob@@ s — ta@@ xi@@ -@@ dri@@ ver , la@@ w@@ y@@ er , co@@ o@@ ks .
As@@ ked them to make a face as a si@@ g@@ n of com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment .
No@@ t a s@@ mi@@ le — that really doesn &apos;t tell about who you are and what you feel .
They all ac@@ cep@@ ted to be pas@@ ted next to the other .
I decided to pas@@ te in ei@@ ght Isra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an ci@@ ties and on both si@@ des of the w@@ all .
We la@@ un@@ ched the bi@@ gg@@ est il@@ le@@ g@@ al art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ever .
We called the project F@@ ace 2 F@@ ace .
The ex@@ per@@ ts said , &quot; &quot; No way .
The people will not ac@@ cep@@ t .
The ar@@ my will sho@@ o@@ t you , and Ha@@ mas will ki@@ d@@ na@@ p you . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; Okay , let &apos;s try and p@@ us@@ h as far as we can . &quot; &quot; I love the way that people will ask me , &quot; How big will my p@@ ho@@ to be ? &quot;
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
When we did the w@@ all , we did the P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an side .
So we ar@@ ri@@ ved with just our la@@ d@@ ders and we realiz@@ ed that they were not high enough .
And so P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ ans gu@@ ys say , &quot; C@@ al@@ m down . No wa@@ it . I &apos;m going to find you a solu@@ tion . &quot;
So he went to the Ch@@ ur@@ ch of Na@@ tivi@@ ty and b@@ rou@@ ght back an old la@@ d@@ der that was so old that it could have seen J@@ es@@ us being bor@@ n .
( Laughter ) We did F@@ ace 2 F@@ ace with only six fri@@ ends , two la@@ d@@ ders , two br@@ us@@ h@@ es , a ren@@ ted car , a cam@@ era and 20@@ ,000 s@@ qu@@ are fe@@ et of pa@@ per .
We had all sor@@ ts of help from all wal@@ ks of life .
Okay , for example , that &apos;s P@@ al@@ est@@ ine .
We &apos;re in R@@ a@@ mal@@ la@@ h right now .
We &apos;re pa@@ st@@ ing por@@ tra@@ its — so both por@@ tra@@ its in the st@@ ree@@ ts in a cro@@ w@@ ded mar@@ ket .
People come around us and start as@@ king , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re actually doing an art project and we are pa@@ st@@ ing an Isra@@ el@@ i and a P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an doing the same job .
And those ones are actually two ta@@ xi@@ -@@ dri@@ ver@@ s . &quot; &quot; And then there was always a si@@ l@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; You mean you &apos;re pa@@ st@@ ing an Isra@@ el@@ i face — doing a face — right here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , that &apos;s part of the project . &quot;
And I would always lea@@ ve that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; So can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
And most of them coul@@ dn &apos;t say .
( Applause ) We even pas@@ ted on Isra@@ el@@ i mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y to@@ w@@ ers , and nothing happened .
When you pas@@ te an ima@@ ge , it &apos;s just pa@@ per and g@@ lue .
People can te@@ ar it , ta@@ g on it , or even pe@@ e on it — some are a bit high for that , I ag@@ ree — but the people in the stre@@ et , they are the cu@@ ra@@ tor .
The ra@@ in and the w@@ ind will take them off any@@ way .
They are not me@@ ant to sta@@ y .
But exactly four years after , the phot@@ os , most of them are still there .
F@@ ace 2 F@@ ace de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted that what we thought im@@ possible was possible — and , you know what , even e@@ as@@ y .
We didn &apos;t p@@ us@@ h the limi@@ t ; we just sho@@ w@@ ed that they were f@@ ur@@ ther than any@@ one thought .
In the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , I experi@@ en@@ ced my work in places without &#91; many &#93; mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms .
So the reac@@ tions in the stre@@ et were kind of interesting .
So I decided to go f@@ ur@@ ther in this direc@@ tion and go in places where there were z@@ ero mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms .
When you go in these develo@@ ping socie@@ ties , wo@@ men are the pi@@ ll@@ ar@@ s of their commun@@ ity , but the men are still the ones h@@ ol@@ ding the st@@ ree@@ ts .
So we were in@@ spi@@ red to create a project where men will pa@@ y tri@@ bu@@ te to wo@@ men by pos@@ ting their phot@@ os .
I called that project W@@ o@@ men A@@ re H@@ er@@ o@@ es .
When I listen@@ ed to all the stories every@@ where I went on the contin@@ ents , I coul@@ dn &apos;t always understand the comp@@ lica@@ ted cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces of their con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
I just obser@@ ved .
So@@ me@@ times there was no words , no s@@ ent@@ ence , just te@@ ar@@ s .
I just took their pic@@ tures and pas@@ ted them .
W@@ o@@ men A@@ re H@@ er@@ o@@ es took me around the world .
Mo@@ st of the places I went to , I decided to go there because I &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
So for example , in J@@ un@@ e 200@@ 8 , I was wat@@ ching T@@ V in Par@@ is , and then I heard about this terri@@ ble thing that happened in R@@ io de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro — the first fa@@ vel@@ a of B@@ raz@@ il na@@ med Pro@@ vi@@ den@@ cia .
Th@@ ree kids — that was three stud@@ ents — were &#91; de@@ tain@@ ed &#93; by the ar@@ my because they were not car@@ r@@ ying their pa@@ per@@ s .
And the ar@@ my took them , and instead of br@@ ing@@ ing them to the poli@@ ce sta@@ tion , they b@@ rou@@ ght them to an en@@ e@@ my fa@@ vel@@ a where they get ch@@ op@@ ped into pi@@ eces .
I was sho@@ c@@ ked .
All B@@ raz@@ il was sho@@ c@@ ked .
I heard it was one of the most viol@@ ent fa@@ vel@@ as , because the lar@@ g@@ est drug car@@ te@@ l contro@@ ls it .
So I decided to go there .
When I ar@@ ri@@ ved — I mean , I didn &apos;t have any con@@ tac@@ t with any N@@ G@@ O .
There was n@@ one in place — no as@@ soci@@ ation , no N@@ G@@ Os , nothing — no e@@ ye@@ w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ ses .
So we just wal@@ ked around , and we me@@ t a woman , and I sho@@ w@@ ed her my book .
And she said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hun@@ gr@@ y for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I started with the kids .
I just took a few phot@@ os of the kids , and the next day I came with the pos@@ ters and we pas@@ ted them .
The day after , I came back and they were already s@@ cra@@ t@@ ched .
But that &apos;s o@@ kay .
I wanted them to feel that this art be@@ lon@@ gs to them .
Then the next day , I hel@@ d a me@@ e@@ ting on the ma@@ in s@@ qu@@ are and some wo@@ men came .
They were all lin@@ ked to the three kids that got k@@ il@@ led .
There was the mother , the gran@@ d@@ mother , the best fri@@ end — they all wanted to sh@@ out the story .
Af@@ ter that day , everyone in the fa@@ vel@@ a ga@@ ve me the green light .
I took more phot@@ os , and we started the project .
The drug l@@ or@@ ds were kind of wor@@ ri@@ ed about us fil@@ ming in the place , so I told them , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
I &apos;m not interes@@ ted in fil@@ ming the viol@@ ence and the we@@ a@@ po@@ ns .
You see that enough in the media .
What I want to show is the incre@@ di@@ ble life and energy .
I &apos;ve been see@@ ing it around me the last few days . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s a really sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c pa@@ st@@ ing , because that &apos;s the first one we did that you coul@@ dn &apos;t see from the city .
And that &apos;s where the three kids got ar@@ res@@ ted , and that &apos;s the gran@@ d@@ mother of one of them .
And on that sta@@ ir@@ s , that &apos;s where the tra@@ f@@ fi@@ c@@ kers always st@@ and and there &apos;s a lot of ex@@ change of fire .
E@@ very@@ one there underst@@ o@@ od the project .
And then we pas@@ ted every@@ where — the whole h@@ ill .
( Applause ) What was interesting is that the media coul@@ dn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
They would have to fil@@ m us from a really long dist@@ ance by he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter and then have a really long len@@ s , and we would see ourselves , on T@@ V , pa@@ st@@ ing .
And they would put a number : &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase call this number if you know what &apos;s going on in Pro@@ vi@@ den@@ cia . &quot; &quot; We just did a project and then left so the media w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t know .
So how can we know about the project ?
So they had to go and find the wo@@ men and get an ex@@ plan@@ ation from them .
So you create a bri@@ dge between the media and the an@@ on@@ y@@ mous wo@@ men .
We ke@@ pt tra@@ vel@@ ing .
We went to Africa , Su@@ dan , S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one , Li@@ ber@@ ia , K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
In war@@ -@@ tor@@ n places like M@@ on@@ ro@@ vi@@ a , people come stra@@ ight to you .
I mean , they want to know what you &apos;re up to .
They ke@@ pt as@@ king me , &quot; &quot; What is the pur@@ pos@@ e of your project ?
A@@ re you an N@@ G@@ O ? A@@ re you the media ? &quot; &quot; Ar@@ t . J@@ ust doing art .
So@@ me people question , &quot; &quot; Why is it in black and whi@@ te ?
D@@ on &apos;t you have col@@ or in Fran@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) O@@ r they tell you , &quot; &quot; A@@ re these people all de@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; So@@ me who underst@@ o@@ od the project would ex@@ pla@@ in it to others .
And to a man who did not understand , I heard someone say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been here for a few h@@ our@@ s trying to understand , dis@@ c@@ us@@ sing with your fel@@ lo@@ ws .
D@@ ur@@ ing that time , you ha@@ ven &apos;t thought about what you &apos;re going to eat to@@ mor@@ row .
This is art . &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s people &apos;s curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty that mo@@ tiv@@ ates them to come into the pro@@ jects .
And then it be@@ comes more .
It be@@ comes a des@@ i@@ re , a need , an ar@@ mor .
O@@ n this bri@@ dge that &apos;s in M@@ on@@ ro@@ vi@@ a , ex@@ -@@ re@@ bel sol@@ di@@ ers hel@@ ped us pa@@ st@@ ing a por@@ tra@@ it of a woman that might have been ra@@ ped dur@@ ing the w@@ ar .
W@@ o@@ men are always the first ones tar@@ ge@@ ted dur@@ ing con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
This is K@@ i@@ b@@ era , K@@ en@@ y@@ a , one of the lar@@ g@@ est s@@ lu@@ ms of Africa .
You might have seen imag@@ es about the pos@@ t@@ -@@ elec@@ tion viol@@ ence that happened there in 200@@ 8 .
This time we co@@ vered the ro@@ of@@ s of the h@@ ou@@ ses , but we didn &apos;t use pa@@ per , because pa@@ per doesn &apos;t pre@@ v@@ ent the ra@@ in from lea@@ king inside the house — vin@@ y@@ l does .
Then art be@@ comes u@@ se@@ ful .
So the people ke@@ pt it .
You know what I love is , for example , when you see the bi@@ gg@@ est ey@@ e there , there are so &#91; many &#93; h@@ ou@@ ses inside .
And I went there a few months ago — phot@@ os are still there — and it was mis@@ sing a piece of the ey@@ e .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just mo@@ ved . &quot;
( Laughter ) When the ro@@ of@@ s were co@@ vered , a woman said as a jo@@ ke , &quot; Now God can see me . &quot;
When you look at K@@ i@@ b@@ era now , they look back .
Okay , In@@ dia .
Be@@ fore I start that , just so you know , each time we go to a place , we don &apos;t have au@@ th@@ ori@@ z@@ ation , so we set up like com@@ man@@ dos — we &apos;re a gro@@ up of fri@@ ends who ar@@ ri@@ ve there , and we try to pas@@ te on the wal@@ ls .
But there are places where you just can &apos;t pas@@ te on a w@@ all .
In In@@ dia it was just im@@ possible to pas@@ te .
I heard cul@@ tur@@ ally and because of the la@@ w , they would just ar@@ res@@ t us at the first pa@@ st@@ ing .
So we decided to pas@@ te whi@@ te , whi@@ te on the wal@@ ls .
So imagine whi@@ te gu@@ ys pa@@ st@@ ing whi@@ te pa@@ per@@ s .
So people would come to us and ask us , &quot; H@@ ey , what are you up to ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , you know , we &apos;re just doing art . &quot; &quot; Ar@@ t ? &quot;
O@@ f course , they were con@@ fu@@ sed .
But you know how In@@ dia has a lot of d@@ ust in the st@@ ree@@ ts , and the more d@@ ust you would have going up in the air , on the whi@@ te pa@@ per you can almost see , but there is this stic@@ k@@ y part like when you re@@ ver@@ se a stic@@ ker .
So the more d@@ ust you have , the more it will re@@ ve@@ al the p@@ ho@@ to .
So we could just wal@@ k in the stre@@ et dur@@ ing the next days and the phot@@ os would get re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by themselves .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get ca@@ u@@ ght this time .
E@@ ach project — that &apos;s a fil@@ m from W@@ o@@ men A@@ re H@@ er@@ o@@ es .
( Music ) Okay .
For each project we do a fil@@ m .
And most of what you see — that &apos;s a tra@@ il@@ er from &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ men A@@ re H@@ er@@ o@@ es &quot; &quot; — its imag@@ es , phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y , ta@@ ken one after the other .
And the phot@@ os ke@@ pt tra@@ vel@@ ing even without us .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly , you &apos;ll see the fil@@ m , and you &apos;ll understand the s@@ co@@ pe of the project and what the people fel@@ t when they saw those phot@@ os .
Because that &apos;s a big part of it . There &apos;s la@@ y@@ ers be@@ hind each p@@ ho@@ to .
Be@@ hind each ima@@ ge is a story .
W@@ o@@ men A@@ re H@@ er@@ o@@ es cre@@ ated a new dy@@ na@@ mic in each of the communi@@ ties , and the wo@@ men ke@@ pt that dy@@ na@@ mic after we left .
For example , we did bo@@ o@@ ks — not for sal@@ e — that all the commun@@ ity would get .
But to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it si@@ g@@ ned by one of the wo@@ men .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly .
And so in Pro@@ vi@@ den@@ cia , for example , in the fa@@ vel@@ a , we have a cul@@ tural cen@@ ter run@@ ning there .
In K@@ i@@ b@@ era , each year we co@@ ver more ro@@ of@@ s .
Because of course , when we left , the people who were just at the e@@ dge of the project said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , what about my ro@@ of ? &quot; &quot; So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project .
A really important point for me is that I don &apos;t use any br@@ and or cor@@ po@@ rate s@@ pon@@ sor@@ s .
So I have no respon@@ si@@ bility to any@@ one but myself and the sub@@ jects .
( Applause ) And that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
I think , today , as important as the resul@@ t is the way you do things .
And that has always been a cent@@ ral part of the work .
And what &apos;s interesting is that fin@@ e line that I have with imag@@ es and ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
We just did some pa@@ st@@ ing in L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles on another project in the last wee@@ ks .
And I was even invi@@ ted to co@@ ver the M@@ O@@ C@@ A mu@@ se@@ um .
But y@@ est@@ er@@ day the city called them and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , you &apos;re going to have to te@@ ar it down .
Because this can be ta@@ ken for ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , and because of the la@@ w , it has to be ta@@ ken down . &quot; &quot; But tell me , ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing for what ?
The people I phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h were pro@@ u@@ d to partici@@ pa@@ te in the project and to have their p@@ ho@@ to in the commun@@ ity .
But they asked me for a pro@@ mi@@ se basi@@ cally .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , make our story tra@@ vel with you . &quot; &quot; So I did . That &apos;s Par@@ is .
That &apos;s R@@ io .
In each place , we buil@@ t ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions with a story , and the story tra@@ ve@@ led .
You understand the full s@@ co@@ pe of the project .
That &apos;s L@@ on@@ don .
Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
And today , they are with you in L@@ ong Be@@ ach .
All right , rec@@ ently I started a publi@@ c art project where I don &apos;t use my ar@@ t@@ work any@@ more .
I use M@@ an R@@ ay , H@@ el@@ en Le@@ vi@@ t@@ t , Gi@@ aco@@ mell@@ i , other people &apos;s ar@@ t@@ work .
It doesn &apos;t matter today if it &apos;s your p@@ ho@@ to or not .
The import@@ ance is what you do with the imag@@ es , the sta@@ te@@ ment it makes where it &apos;s pas@@ ted .
So for example , I pas@@ ted the p@@ ho@@ to of the min@@ ar@@ et in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land a few wee@@ ks after they vo@@ ted the la@@ w for@@ bi@@ d@@ ding min@@ are@@ ts in the country .
( Applause ) This ima@@ ge of three men w@@ ear@@ ing gas mas@@ ks was ta@@ ken in Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally , and I pas@@ ted it in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n I@@ tal@@ y , where the ma@@ fi@@ a sometimes bur@@ y the gar@@ b@@ age under the ground .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Ar@@ t is not sup@@ pos@@ ed to change the world , to change prac@@ tical things , but to change per@@ cep@@ tions .
Ar@@ t can change the way we see the world .
Ar@@ t can create an anal@@ o@@ gy .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neu@@ tra@@ l place for ex@@ chan@@ ges and dis@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons , and then en@@ ab@@ les you to change the world .
When I do my work , I have two kinds of reac@@ tions .
People say , &quot; &quot; Oh , why don &apos;t you go in I@@ ra@@ q or Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
They would be really u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; O@@ r , &quot; &quot; How can we help ? &quot; &quot; I pres@@ u@@ me that you be@@ long to the second ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory , and that &apos;s good , because for that project , I &apos;m going to ask you to take the phot@@ os and pas@@ te them .
So now my wis@@ h is : ( mo@@ ck dru@@ m ro@@ ll ) ( Laughter ) I wis@@ h for you to st@@ and up for what you care about by partici@@ pa@@ ting in a global art project , and together we &apos;ll turn the world inside out .
And this star@@ ts right now .
Y@@ es , everyone in the room .
E@@ very@@ one wat@@ ching .
I wanted that wis@@ h to actually start now .
So a sub@@ ject you &apos;re pas@@ sion@@ ate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own phot@@ os — tell me what you st@@ and for .
Ta@@ ke the phot@@ os , the por@@ tra@@ its , u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad it — I &apos;ll give you all the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s — and I &apos;ll sen@@ d you back your pos@@ ter . Jo@@ in by g@@ rou@@ ps and re@@ ve@@ al things to the world .
The full data is on the we@@ b@@ si@@ te — in@@ si@@ de@@ out@@ pro@@ jec@@ t@@ .@@ net — that is la@@ un@@ ching today .
What we see chan@@ ges who we are .
When we ac@@ t together , the whole thing is much more than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts .
So I hope that , together , we &apos;ll create something that the world will remember .
And this star@@ ts right now and depen@@ ds on you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Well , we all need a reason to wa@@ ke up .
For me , it just took 1@@ 1@@ ,000 vol@@ ts .
It was just si@@ tting there , with the w@@ ir@@ es that r@@ un over@@ head .
We &apos;d cer@@ tain@@ ly done stu@@ pi@@ der things .
W@@ ould you believe that wat@@ ch still works ?
Ta@@ kes a li@@ c@@ king !
That ni@@ ght beg@@ an my forma@@ l rela@@ tion@@ ship with death — my death — and it also beg@@ an my long r@@ un as a pati@@ ent .
So I gu@@ ess we &apos;re all patients .
Why ?
Wh@@ ich is to say , of course , it was b@@ ad@@ ly desig@@ ned .
There are no do@@ -@@ over@@ s .
So let &apos;s beg@@ in at the end .
It &apos;s a k@@ ey dist@@ inc@@ tion .
It can be really good to realiz@@ e for@@ ces lar@@ ger than ourselves .
It took me a while , but I learned it ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally .
This , we are finally realiz@@ ing , is where heal@@ ing happens .
It ser@@ ves no good pur@@ pos@@ e .
How we di@@ e is in@@ de@@ ed something we can af@@ fec@@ t .
It &apos;s simply about com@@ for@@ t and living well at any sta@@ ge .
Now , let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to Fran@@ k .
S@@ or@@ t of makes this point .
In this way , Fran@@ k g@@ ri@@ e@@ ves .
Lo@@ ss is one thing , but re@@ gre@@ t , quite another .
W@@ as this a good idea ?
W@@ ith all the ris@@ ks to his sa@@ fe@@ ty and his health , some would say no .
So much of what we &apos;re talking about today is a shi@@ ft in per@@ spec@@ tive .
I re@@ ver@@ e ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als for what they can do ; I am ali@@ ve because of them .
But we ask too much of our ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als .
They are places for ac@@ u@@ te tra@@ u@@ ma and tre@@ a@@ table ill@@ ness .
Be@@ au@@ ty can be found any@@ where .
And one ni@@ ght , it beg@@ an to s@@ now out@@ side .
I remember my n@@ ur@@ ses com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing about dri@@ ving through it .
N@@ ext day , one of my n@@ ur@@ ses s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in a s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all for me .
In a hospital , that &apos;s a st@@ ol@@ en moment .
And we are no@@ where ne@@ ar ready or pre@@ par@@ ed for this si@@ l@@ ver t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i .
Now is the time to create something new , something vi@@ tal .
We have t@@ ons of in@@ put for desig@@ n@@ ers of all stri@@ pes to work with .
L@@ it@@ t@@ le things ar@@ en &apos;t so little .
Ta@@ ke J@@ an@@ et@@ te .
Pri@@ ori@@ ties change .
B@@ en@@ e@@ fi@@ cen@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; P@@ la@@ y &quot; &quot; may sound like a fun@@ ny word here .
But it is also one of our high@@ est for@@ ms of ada@@ p@@ tation .
The need for food has bir@@ the@@ d cu@@ is@@ ine .
We can &apos;t sol@@ ve for death .
I know some of you are working on this .
Thank you .
In In@@ dia , we have these hu@@ ge famili@@ es .
I be@@ t a lot of you all must have heard about it .
Wh@@ ich means that there are a lot of family ev@@ ents .
So as a child , my parents used to dra@@ g me to these family ev@@ ents .
But the one thing that I always looked for@@ ward to was pla@@ ying around with my cous@@ ins .
And there was always this one un@@ cle who used to be there , always ready , j@@ u@@ mp@@ ing around with us , having games for us , making us kids have the time of our lives .
This man was extre@@ me@@ ly suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful : he was confi@@ d@@ ent and power@@ ful .
But then I saw this hal@@ e and hear@@ ty person de@@ teri@@ or@@ ate in health .
He was diagno@@ sed with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s .
Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s is a disease that caus@@ es de@@ gener@@ ation of the ner@@ v@@ ous system , which means that this person who used to be in@@ depen@@ d@@ ent su@@ d@@ den@@ ly fin@@ ds tas@@ ks like dr@@ in@@ king co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , because of tre@@ mor@@ s , much more dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t .
My un@@ cle started using a wal@@ ker to wal@@ k , and to take a turn , he liter@@ ally had to take one ste@@ p at a time , like this , and it took fo@@ re@@ ver .
So this person , who used to be the cen@@ ter of attention in every family ga@@ ther@@ ing , was su@@ d@@ den@@ ly hi@@ ding be@@ hind people .
He was hi@@ ding from the pi@@ ti@@ ful look in people &apos;s eyes .
And he &apos;s not the only one in the world .
E@@ very year , 6@@ 0@@ ,000 people are ne@@ w@@ ly diagno@@ sed with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , and this number is only ri@@ sing .
As desig@@ n@@ ers , we dre@@ am that our desig@@ ns sol@@ ve these multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ted problems , one solu@@ tion that sol@@ ves it all , but it need not always be like that .
You can also tar@@ get simple problems and create small solu@@ tions for them and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally make a big impac@@ t .
So my ai@@ m here was to not cur@@ e Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , but to make their every@@ day tas@@ ks much more simple , and then make an impac@@ t .
Well , the first thing I tar@@ ge@@ ted was tre@@ mor@@ s , right ?
My un@@ cle told me that he had st@@ op@@ ped dr@@ in@@ king co@@ f@@ fe@@ e or te@@ a in publi@@ c just out of e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ s@@ ment , so , well , I desig@@ ned the no@@ -@@ sp@@ ill cu@@ p .
It works just pu@@ re@@ ly on its form .
The cur@@ ve on top de@@ f@@ lec@@ ts the li@@ qui@@ d back inside every time they have tre@@ mor@@ s , and this ke@@ e@@ ps the li@@ qui@@ d inside compar@@ ed to a normal cu@@ p .
But the k@@ ey here is that it is not ta@@ gg@@ ed as a Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s pati@@ ent produc@@ t .
It loo@@ ks like a cu@@ p that could be used by you , me , any c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y person , and that makes it much more com@@ for@@ ting for them to use , to b@@ l@@ end in .
So , well , one problem sol@@ ved , many more to go .
All this while , I was inter@@ vie@@ wing him , ques@@ tion@@ ing him , and then I realiz@@ ed that I was getting very super@@ fici@@ al information , or just ans@@ w@@ ers to my ques@@ tions .
But I really nee@@ ded to di@@ g de@@ e@@ per to get a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
So I thought , well , let &apos;s obser@@ ve him in his da@@ i@@ ly tas@@ ks , while he &apos;s e@@ ating , while he &apos;s wat@@ ching T@@ V .
And then , when I was actually obser@@ ving him wal@@ king to his din@@ ing table , it struc@@ k me , this man who fin@@ ds it so dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to wal@@ k on fl@@ at land , how does he cli@@ m@@ b a sta@@ ir@@ case ?
Because in In@@ dia we do not have a fan@@ cy ra@@ il that takes you up a sta@@ ir@@ case like in the developed countries .
One actually has to cli@@ m@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ s .
So he told me , &quot; Well , let me show you how I do it . &quot;
Let &apos;s take a look at what I saw .
So he took really long to re@@ ach this posi@@ tion , and then all this while , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , is he really going to do it ?
I@@ s he really , really going to do it without his wal@@ ker ? &quot; &quot; And then ...
( Laughter ) And the tur@@ ns , he took them so e@@ asi@@ ly .
So — sho@@ c@@ ked ?
Well , I was too .
So this person who could not wal@@ k on fl@@ at land was su@@ d@@ den@@ ly a pr@@ o at cli@@ mb@@ ing sta@@ ir@@ s .
O@@ n resear@@ ching this , I realiz@@ ed that it &apos;s because it &apos;s a continu@@ ous mo@@ tion .
There &apos;s this other man who also suf@@ fer@@ s from the same sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms and us@@ es a wal@@ ker , but the moment he &apos;s put on a cy@@ cle , all his sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms van@@ is@@ h , because it is a continu@@ ous mo@@ tion .
So the k@@ ey for me was to trans@@ late this fe@@ el@@ ing of wal@@ king on a sta@@ ir@@ case back to fl@@ at land .
And a lot of ideas were t@@ es@@ ted and tri@@ ed on him , but the one that finally worked was this one . Let &apos;s take a look .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) He wal@@ ked fas@@ ter , right ? ( Applause )
I call this the sta@@ ir@@ case ill@@ u@@ sion , and actually when the sta@@ ir@@ case ill@@ u@@ sion ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly en@@ ded , he fro@@ ze , and this is called f@@ ree@@ zing of ga@@ it .
So it happens a lot , so why not have a sta@@ ir@@ case ill@@ u@@ sion flo@@ wing through all their roo@@ ms , making them feel much more confi@@ d@@ ent ?
You know , technology is not always it .
What we need are human@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed solu@@ tions .
I could have e@@ asi@@ ly made it into a pro@@ jec@@ tion , or a Goog@@ le G@@ la@@ ss , or something like that .
But I st@@ uc@@ k to simple pr@@ int on the flo@@ or .
This pr@@ int could be ta@@ ken into ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als to make them feel much more w@@ el@@ come .
What I wis@@ h to do is make every Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s pati@@ ent feel like my un@@ cle fel@@ t that day .
He told me that I made him feel like his old self again .
&quot; &quot; S@@ mar@@ t &quot; &quot; in today &apos;s world has become sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ mous to high te@@ ch , and the world is only getting s@@ mar@@ ter and s@@ mar@@ ter day by day .
But why can &apos;t s@@ mar@@ t be something that &apos;s simple and yet effec@@ tive ?
All we need is a little bit of em@@ path@@ y and some curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty , to go out there , obser@@ ve .
But let &apos;s not stop at that .
Let &apos;s find these comple@@ x problems . D@@ on &apos;t be s@@ car@@ ed of them .
B@@ re@@ ak them , bo@@ il them down into much s@@ mal@@ ler problems , and then find simple solu@@ tions for them .
T@@ est these solu@@ tions , fa@@ il if nee@@ ded , but with ne@@ wer in@@ si@@ ghts to make it better .
Ima@@ g@@ ine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solu@@ tions .
What would the world be like if we com@@ bin@@ ed all our simple solu@@ tions ?
Let &apos;s make a s@@ mar@@ ter world , but with simp@@ li@@ city .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about consci@@ ousness .
Why consci@@ ousness ?
Well , it &apos;s a curi@@ ously ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted sub@@ ject , both in our scienti@@ fic and our phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phi@@ cal culture .
Now why is that curi@@ ous ?
So consci@@ ousness is number one .
When I first got interes@@ ted in this , I thought , well , it &apos;s a stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward problem in bio@@ logy .
Okay , now why then is this curi@@ ous re@@ l@@ uc@@ tan@@ ce and curi@@ ous ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty to consci@@ ousness ?
Well , I think it &apos;s a com@@ bin@@ ation of two fe@@ atur@@ es of our inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tual culture that like to think they &apos;re op@@ pos@@ ing each other but in fact they share a common set of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
One fe@@ ature is the tradi@@ tion of reli@@ gi@@ ous du@@ al@@ ism : Con@@ sci@@ ousness is not a part of the physical world .
It &apos;s a part of the spi@@ ri@@ tual world .
It be@@ lon@@ gs to the s@@ ou@@ l , and the s@@ ou@@ l is not a part of the physical world .
That &apos;s the tradi@@ tion of God , the s@@ ou@@ l and im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity .
That tradi@@ tion thin@@ ks that we are he@@ av@@ y@@ -@@ du@@ ty scienti@@ fic materi@@ ali@@ sts : Con@@ sci@@ ousness is not a part of the physical world .
E@@ i@@ ther it doesn &apos;t exis@@ t at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer progra@@ m or some da@@ m@@ n fo@@ ol thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
And I used to get in an ar@@ gu@@ ment that really ga@@ ve me a sto@@ mach@@ ac@@ he .
Okay , so these tw@@ in tradi@@ tions are par@@ al@@ y@@ zing us .
It &apos;s very hard to get out of these tw@@ in tradi@@ tions .
It &apos;s e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ sing how inf@@ lu@@ enti@@ al behavi@@ or@@ ism was , but I &apos;ll get back to that .
And four : Ma@@ ybe consci@@ ousness exist@@ s , but it can &apos;t make any differ@@ ence to the world .
How could spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality move anything ?
Now , wh@@ en@@ ever somebody te@@ lls me that , I think , you want to see spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality move something ?
W@@ at@@ ch . I deci@@ de consci@@ ously to rai@@ se my ar@@ m , and the da@@ m@@ n thing goes up . ( Laughter ) F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , no@@ tice this : We do not say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a bit like the we@@ a@@ ther in G@@ en@@ e@@ va .
So@@ me days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; No . It goes up wh@@ en@@ ever I da@@ m@@ n well want it to .
Okay . I &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
Now , I ha@@ ven &apos;t yet given you a defini@@ tion .
You can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a defini@@ tion .
People always say consci@@ ousness is very hard to defin@@ e .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness consi@@ sts of all those sta@@ tes of fe@@ el@@ ing or senti@@ ence or a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
It beg@@ ins in the mor@@ ning when you wa@@ ke up from a dre@@ am@@ less s@@ le@@ ep , and it goes on all day until you f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep or di@@ e or o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se become un@@ consci@@ ous .
D@@ re@@ a@@ ms are a form of consci@@ ousness on this defini@@ tion .
Now , that &apos;s the com@@ mon@@ -@@ sense defini@@ tion . That &apos;s our tar@@ get .
If you &apos;re not talking about that , you &apos;re not talking about consci@@ ousness .
But they think , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an aw@@ ful problem .
How can such a thing exis@@ t as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; And this , if you &apos;ve ever had a phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y course , this is kno@@ wn as the fa@@ mous min@@ d-@@ body problem .
I think that has a simple solu@@ tion too . I &apos;m going to give it to you .
It &apos;s about as my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous as the li@@ qui@@ di@@ ty of water .
It &apos;s a condi@@ tion that the system is in .
And just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from li@@ qui@@ d to so@@ li@@ d depen@@ ding on the behavi@@ or of the mole@@ cul@@ es , so your brain can go from a sta@@ te of being consci@@ ous to a sta@@ te of being un@@ consci@@ ous , depen@@ ding on the behavi@@ or of the mole@@ cul@@ es .
The fa@@ mous min@@ d-@@ body problem is that simple .
All right ? But now we get into some har@@ der ques@@ tions .
You can &apos;t get ri@@ d of it .
It consci@@ ously see@@ ms to us , but that &apos;s not really happen@@ ing .
But for that dist@@ inc@@ tion between how things consci@@ ously see@@ m and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that dist@@ inc@@ tion for the very exist@@ ence of consci@@ ousness , because where the very exist@@ ence of consci@@ ousness is con@@ cer@@ ned , if it consci@@ ously see@@ ms to you that you are consci@@ ous , you are consci@@ ous .
You cannot dou@@ b@@ t the exist@@ ence of your own consci@@ ousness .
Okay , that &apos;s the first fe@@ ature of consci@@ ousness .
It &apos;s real and ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ ble .
You cannot get ri@@ d of it by sho@@ wing that it &apos;s an ill@@ u@@ sion in a way that you can with other stan@@ d@@ ard ill@@ u@@ si@@ ons .
There &apos;s something that it fe@@ els like to dr@@ in@@ k be@@ er which is not what it fe@@ els like to do your in@@ come ta@@ x or li@@ ste@@ n to music , and this qu@@ ali@@ ta@@ tive feel auto@@ ma@@ tically gener@@ ates a th@@ ird fe@@ ature , na@@ me@@ ly , consci@@ ous sta@@ tes are by defini@@ tion sub@@ jec@@ tive in the sense that they only exis@@ t as experi@@ en@@ ced by some human or animal sub@@ ject , some self that experi@@ ences them .
That is the k@@ ey to underst@@ an@@ ding the enor@@ mous power of consci@@ ousness .
And we have not been able to do that in a ro@@ bo@@ t .
The disa@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment of ro@@ bo@@ tics der@@ i@@ ves from the fact that we don &apos;t know how to make a consci@@ ous ro@@ bo@@ t , so we don &apos;t have a mach@@ ine that can do this kind of thing .
Okay , the next fe@@ ature of consci@@ ousness , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous uni@@ fi@@ ed consci@@ ous fiel@@ d , is that it func@@ tions caus@@ ally in our behavi@@ or .
I ga@@ ve you a scienti@@ fic de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion by ra@@ is@@ ing my hand , but how is that possible ?
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material ob@@ jects ?
Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer .
S@@ or@@ ry to use phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phi@@ cal termin@@ o@@ logy here , but when it &apos;s se@@ cre@@ ted at the ax@@ on en@@ d-@@ pla@@ tes of the mot@@ or neurons , a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the i@@ on chan@@ n@@ els and the da@@ m@@ ned ar@@ m goes up .
Now , think of what I told you .
One and the same ev@@ ent , my consci@@ ous deci@@ sion to rai@@ se my ar@@ m has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it has all of these tou@@ ch@@ y@@ -@@ fe@@ e@@ ly spi@@ ri@@ tual qu@@ ali@@ ties .
It &apos;s a thought in my brain , but at the same time , it &apos;s bus@@ y se@@ cre@@ ting ace@@ ty@@ l@@ ch@@ ol@@ ine and doing all sor@@ ts of other things as it makes its way from the mot@@ or cor@@ tex down through the ner@@ ve fi@@ b@@ ers in the ar@@ m .
Now , what that te@@ lls us is that our tradi@@ tional vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ari@@ es for dis@@ c@@ us@@ sing these is@@ su@@ es are tot@@ ally ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
One and the same ev@@ ent has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s neuro@@ bio@@ logical , and another level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single ev@@ ent , and that &apos;s how n@@ ature works . That &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consci@@ ousness to func@@ tion caus@@ ally .
Okay , now with that in mind , with going through these vari@@ ous fe@@ atur@@ es of consci@@ ousness , let &apos;s go back and answer some of those early ob@@ jec@@ tions .
I don &apos;t think we need to wor@@ ry about that .
It &apos;s really a di@@ gi@@ tal computer progra@@ m run@@ ning in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consci@@ ousness is get the right progra@@ m .
I mean , any@@ body who &apos;s thought about compu@@ ters at all can see that that &apos;s wrong , because compu@@ tation is defin@@ ed as sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , us@@ u@@ ally thought of as z@@ er@@ os as ones , but any sy@@ mb@@ ols will do .
You get an alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m that you can progra@@ m in a bin@@ ary co@@ de , and that &apos;s the defin@@ ing tra@@ it of the computer progra@@ m .
But we know that that &apos;s pu@@ re@@ ly sy@@ n@@ tac@@ tical . That &apos;s sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c .
We know that actual human consci@@ ousness has something more than that .
It &apos;s got a cont@@ ent in ad@@ di@@ tion to the sy@@ n@@ ta@@ x .
It &apos;s got a seman@@ tics .
It cre@@ ates a re@@ ality of money , pro@@ per@@ ty , government , mar@@ ri@@ age , C@@ E@@ R@@ N con@@ fer@@ ences , co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ties and su@@ mm@@ er va@@ ca@@ tions , and all of those are crea@@ tions of consci@@ ousness .
Th@@ e@@ ir exist@@ ence is obser@@ ver@@ -@@ rela@@ tive .
I@@ s that absolu@@ te , like for@@ ce and ma@@ ss and gra@@ vi@@ ta@@ tional at@@ tra@@ c@@ tion ?
O@@ r is it obser@@ ver@@ -@@ rela@@ tive ?
Well , some compu@@ ta@@ tions are in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic .
I ad@@ d two pl@@ us two to get four .
That &apos;s going on no matter what any@@ body thin@@ ks .
But when I ha@@ u@@ l out my po@@ c@@ ket cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tor and do the cal@@ cu@@ lation , the only in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on is the elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c cir@@ cu@@ it and its behavi@@ or .
That &apos;s the only absolu@@ te ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on .
All the res@@ t is inter@@ pre@@ ted by us .
Co@@ mp@@ u@@ tation only exist@@ s rela@@ tive to consci@@ ousness .
E@@ i@@ ther a consci@@ ous ag@@ ent is car@@ r@@ ying out the compu@@ tation , or he &apos;s got a piece of mach@@ in@@ er@@ y that ad@@ mi@@ ts of a compu@@ ta@@ tional inter@@ pre@@ tation .
Now that doesn &apos;t mean compu@@ tation is ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary .
I sp@@ ent a lot of money on this har@@ d@@ w@@ are .
But we have this per@@ si@@ st@@ ent con@@ fu@@ sion between ob@@ jec@@ tivi@@ ty and sub@@ jec@@ tivi@@ ty as fe@@ atur@@ es of re@@ ality and ob@@ jec@@ tivi@@ ty and sub@@ jec@@ tivi@@ ty as fe@@ atur@@ es of cla@@ im@@ s .
So the ob@@ jec@@ tion that you can &apos;t have an ob@@ jec@@ tive science of consci@@ ousness because it &apos;s sub@@ jec@@ tive and science is ob@@ jec@@ tive , that &apos;s a p@@ un .
Y@@ our mental sta@@ tes are iden@@ tical with your behavi@@ or ?
Well , think about the dist@@ inc@@ tion between fe@@ el@@ ing a pa@@ in and eng@@ aging in pa@@ in behavi@@ or .
You &apos;re gi@@ ving up on 3@@ 00 years of human pro@@ g@@ ress and human hope and all the res@@ t of it .
And the mes@@ sa@@ ge I want to lea@@ ve you with is , consci@@ ousness has to become ac@@ cep@@ ted as a gen@@ u@@ ine bio@@ logical ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on , as much sub@@ ject to scienti@@ fic anal@@ y@@ sis as any other ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on in bio@@ logy , or , for that matter , the res@@ t of science .
Thank you very much .

D@@ ri@@ ving ourselves .
J@@ ust in the last two days , we got the new tem@@ per@@ ature recor@@ ds in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
N@@ ext , consi@@ der making your bus@@ in@@ ess car@@ bon@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l .
In@@ v@@ est s@@ us@@ tain@@ ab@@ ly .
You may never have heard of K@@ en@@ e@@ ma , S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one or A@@ ru@@ a , N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
But I know them as two of the most extraordin@@ ary places on ear@@ th .
L@@ as@@ sa vir@@ us is a lot like E@@ bol@@ a .
It can cause a se@@ ver@@ e fe@@ ver and can of@@ ten be fa@@ tal .
But these individu@@ als , they ris@@ k their lives every day to protec@@ t the individu@@ als in their communi@@ ties , and by doing so , protec@@ t us all .
But one of the most extraordin@@ ary things I learned about them on one of my first visi@@ ts out there many years ago was that they start each mor@@ ning — these ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ ing , extraordin@@ ary days on the front lin@@ es — by sing@@ ing .
They ga@@ ther together , and they show their jo@@ y .
They show their spi@@ ri@@ t .
And over the years , from year after year as I &apos;ve visi@@ ted them and they &apos;ve visi@@ ted me , I get to ga@@ ther with them and I sing and we wri@@ te and we love it , because it re@@ min@@ ds us that we &apos;re not just there to pur@@ su@@ e science together ; we &apos;re bon@@ ded through a shar@@ ed human@@ ity .
And that of course , as you can imagine , be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly important , even es@@ senti@@ al , as things beg@@ in to change .
And that chan@@ ged a great de@@ al in Mar@@ ch of 20@@ 1@@ 4 , when the E@@ bol@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak was de@@ clar@@ ed in Gu@@ in@@ e@@ a .
This is the first out@@ bre@@ ak in W@@ est Africa , ne@@ ar the bor@@ der of S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one and Li@@ ber@@ ia .
And it was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing for us all .
We &apos;d already set up this kind of capaci@@ ty for L@@ as@@ sa vir@@ us , we knew how to do it , the te@@ am is out@@ stan@@ ding .
We just had to give them the to@@ ols and place to sur@@ ve@@ y for E@@ bol@@ a .
And un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , that day came .
O@@ n M@@ ay 2@@ 3 , 20@@ 1@@ 4 , a woman ch@@ ec@@ ked into the ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity ward at the hospital , and the te@@ am ran those important mole@@ cular t@@ est@@ s and they identi@@ fi@@ ed the first con@@ fir@@ med case of E@@ bol@@ a in S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one .
This was an ex@@ cep@@ tional work that was done .
They were able to diagno@@ se the case im@@ medi@@ ately , to sa@@ fe@@ ly tre@@ at the pati@@ ent and to beg@@ in to do con@@ tac@@ t tra@@ c@@ ing to fol@@ low what was going on .
It could &apos;ve st@@ op@@ ped something .
But by the time that day came , the out@@ bre@@ ak had already been bre@@ e@@ ding for months .
W@@ ith hundre@@ ds of ca@@ ses , it had already ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed all pre@@ vi@@ ous out@@ bre@@ a@@ ks .
And it came into S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one not as that sin@@ gu@@ lar case , but as a ti@@ da@@ l wa@@ ve .
And we worked around the clo@@ ck trying to do everything we could , trying to help the individu@@ als , trying to get attention , but we also did one other simple thing .
F@@ ro@@ m that speci@@ men that we take from a pati@@ ent &apos;s blood to detec@@ t E@@ bol@@ a , we can dis@@ car@@ d it , obvi@@ ously .
The other thing we can do is , actually , put in a che@@ mi@@ cal and de@@ activ@@ ate it , so just place it into a bo@@ x and ship it across the ocean , and that &apos;s what we did .
We s@@ ent it to Bo@@ st@@ on , where my te@@ am works .
And we also worked around the clo@@ ck doing shi@@ ft work , day after day , and we qu@@ ick@@ ly gener@@ ated 9@@ 9 gen@@ o@@ mes of the E@@ bol@@ a vir@@ us .
This is the b@@ lu@@ e@@ pr@@ int — the gen@@ o@@ me of a vir@@ us is the b@@ lu@@ e@@ pr@@ int .
We all have one .
It says everything that makes up us , and it te@@ lls us so much information .
The resul@@ ts of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re power@@ ful .
Now , that &apos;s incre@@ di@@ bly important when you &apos;re trying to figur@@ e out how to inter@@ ven@@ e , but the important thing is con@@ tac@@ t tra@@ c@@ ing .
We also could see that as the vir@@ us was mo@@ ving between human@@ s , it was mu@@ ta@@ ting .
And each of those mu@@ ta@@ tions are so important , because the diagno@@ stics , the vac@@ cin@@ es , the ther@@ a@@ pi@@ es that we &apos;re using , are all based on that gen@@ o@@ me se@@ qu@@ ence , funda@@ ment@@ ally — that &apos;s what dri@@ ves it .
And so global health ex@@ per@@ ts would need to respon@@ d , would have to develo@@ p , to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te everything that they were doing .
That &apos;s the way the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o works .
Well , that was not going to work at this point , right ?
We had fri@@ ends on the front lin@@ es and to us it was just obvi@@ ous that what we nee@@ ded is help , l@@ ots of help .
We were working together in this virtual way , shar@@ ing , regu@@ lar cal@@ ls , communi@@ ca@@ tions , trying to fol@@ low the vir@@ us minu@@ te by minu@@ te , to see ways that we could stop it .
And there are so many ways that we can form communi@@ ties like that .
E@@ very@@ body , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly when the out@@ bre@@ ak started to ex@@ p@@ and glob@@ ally , was re@@ ach@@ ing out to learn , to partici@@ pa@@ te , to eng@@ age .
E@@ very@@ body wan@@ ts to play a part .
And could you imagine that instead of being fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of each other , that we all just said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do this .
Let &apos;s work together , and let &apos;s make this happen . &quot; &quot; But the problem is that the data that all of us are using , Goog@@ ling on the we@@ b , is just too limi@@ ted to do what we need to do .
So in the early part of the e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic from K@@ en@@ e@@ ma , we &apos;d had 10@@ 6 c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal recor@@ ds from patients , and we on@@ ce again made that publi@@ c@@ ly a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to the world .
But 10@@ 6 is just not enough to make it power@@ ful , to v@@ ali@@ da@@ te it .
and the data has still not come .
We are still wa@@ it@@ ing , tw@@ e@@ a@@ king away , in si@@ los ra@@ ther than working together .
And this just — we can &apos;t ac@@ cep@@ t that .
R@@ ight ? You , all of you , cannot ac@@ cep@@ t that .
It &apos;s our lives on the line .
These are just five of many health@@ -@@ care wor@@ kers at K@@ en@@ e@@ ma and be@@ y@@ on@@ d that died while the world wa@@ i@@ ted and while we all worked , qui@@ e@@ tly and separ@@ ately .
When we build bar@@ ri@@ ers a@@ mon@@ g@@ st ourselves and we fi@@ ght a@@ mon@@ g@@ st ourselves , the vir@@ us th@@ ri@@ ves .
We &apos;re all in this fi@@ ght together .
E@@ bol@@ a on one person &apos;s do@@ or@@ ste@@ p could so@@ on be on our@@ s .
And so in this place with the same vulner@@ abili@@ ties , the same str@@ eng@@ ths , the same f@@ ear@@ s , the same ho@@ pes , I hope that we work together with jo@@ y .
A gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent of min@@ e was read@@ ing a book about S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one , and she disco@@ vered that the word &quot; &quot; K@@ en@@ e@@ ma , &quot; &quot; the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in S@@ i@@ erra Le@@ one , is na@@ med after the M@@ en@@ de word for &quot; &quot; c@@ lear like a ri@@ ver , trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent and open to the publi@@ c ga@@ ze . &quot; &quot; That was really pro@@ found for us , because without kno@@ wing it , we &apos;d always fel@@ t that in order to hon@@ or the individu@@ als in K@@ en@@ e@@ ma where we worked , we had to work op@@ en@@ ly , we had to share and we had to work together .
And we have to do that .
We all have to de@@ m@@ and that of ourselves and others — to be open to each other when an out@@ bre@@ ak happens , to fi@@ ght in this fi@@ ght together .
Because this is not the first out@@ bre@@ ak of E@@ bol@@ a , it will not be the last , and there are many other micro@@ b@@ es out there that are l@@ ying in wa@@ it , like L@@ as@@ sa vir@@ us and others .
And the next time this happens , it could happen in a city of mi@@ llions , it could start there .
It could be something that &apos;s transmi@@ t@@ ted through the air .
It could even be dis@@ se@@ min@@ ated inten@@ tion@@ ally .
And I know that that is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , I understand that , but I know also , and this experience sho@@ ws us , that we have the technology and we have the capaci@@ ty to w@@ in this thing , to w@@ in this and have the u@@ p@@ per hand over vir@@ us@@ es .
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with jo@@ y .
So for D@@ r. K@@ ha@@ n and for all of those who sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced their lives on the front lin@@ es in this fi@@ ght with us always , let us be in this fi@@ ght with them always .
And let us not let the world be defin@@ ed by the dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion w@@ rou@@ ght by one vir@@ us , but ill@@ u@@ min@@ ated by bi@@ llions of hear@@ ts and min@@ ds working in un@@ ity .
Thank you .

D@@ o you need new g@@ la@@ s@@ ses ?
A@@ re you lo@@ sing your mind ?
You r@@ un through a qu@@ ick mental ch@@ ec@@ k@@ li@@ st .
The stri@@ king thing about it is that only face recogni@@ tion is im@@ pa@@ i@@ red ; everything else is just fin@@ e .
So I was the first sub@@ ject .
So that &apos;s pretty co@@ ol , but how do we know this isn &apos;t a f@@ lu@@ ke ?
Well , the e@@ asi@@ est way is to just do the experi@@ ment again .
So I got back in the s@@ can@@ ner , I looked at more fac@@ es and I looked at more ob@@ jects and I got a similar blo@@ b , and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again , and around about then I decided to believe it was for real .
So with the pati@@ ent &apos;s con@@ s@@ ent , the doc@@ tors asked him what happened when they elec@@ tri@@ cally sti@@ mu@@ la@@ ted that part of his brain .
L@@ oo@@ k at my face .
You almost looked like somebody I &apos;d seen before , but somebody different .
N@@ ext , I &apos;ll go through much more qu@@ ick@@ ly some of the other speci@@ aliz@@ ed re@@ gi@@ ons of the brain that we and others have found .
N@@ ext , let &apos;s find that face are@@ a I &apos;ve been talking about that respon@@ ds to imag@@ es like these .
Y@@ es , we do . So if we turn the brain around a little bit , here &apos;s a re@@ gi@@ on in dar@@ k blue that we re@@ por@@ ted just a cou@@ ple of months ago , and this re@@ gi@@ on respon@@ ds st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly when you he@@ ar so@@ unds with p@@ it@@ ch , like these .
Okay , now let &apos;s look at these same re@@ gi@@ ons .
Y@@ es , we do .
So here in p@@ in@@ k are my language re@@ gi@@ ons .
So it &apos;s been kno@@ wn for a very long time that that gener@@ al vi@@ cin@@ ity of the brain is invol@@ ved in pro@@ ces@@ sing language , but we sho@@ w@@ ed very rec@@ ently that these p@@ in@@ k re@@ gi@@ ons respon@@ d extre@@ me@@ ly se@@ lec@@ tively .
They respon@@ d when you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of a s@@ ent@@ ence , but not when you do other comple@@ x mental things , like mental ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic or h@@ ol@@ ding information in memor@@ y or ap@@ preci@@ ating the comple@@ x struc@@ ture in a piece of music .
This re@@ gi@@ on respon@@ ds when you think about what another person is thinking .
So that may see@@ m cra@@ z@@ y , but actually , we human@@ s do this all the time .
And f@@ ur@@ ther , he found a similar respon@@ se in more or less the same lo@@ cation in 10 out of 12 sub@@ jects .
And his re@@ gi@@ on respon@@ ded the same to both se@@ ts of imag@@ es .
I mean , it could have been o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se .
In@@ stead , what brain imag@@ ing has de@@ li@@ vered is this ri@@ ch and interesting picture of the human mind .
It &apos;s early days in this en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se .
We &apos;ve pa@@ in@@ ted only the first br@@ us@@ h@@ st@@ ro@@ kes in our neu@@ ral por@@ tra@@ it of the human mind .
So for example , what does each of these re@@ gi@@ ons do exactly ?
Se@@ con@@ d , how are all these things connec@@ ted in the brain ?
That &apos;s a hu@@ ge@@ ly important go@@ al , and I &apos;d be th@@ ri@@ l@@ led if any of my work con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to it , but fix@@ ing things that are bro@@ ken in the world is not the only thing that &apos;s wor@@ th doing .
The ef@@ for@@ t to understand the human mind and brain is wor@@ th@@ while even if it never led to the tre@@ at@@ ment of a single disease .
This is , I think , the gre@@ at@@ est scienti@@ fic qu@@ est of all time .
( Applause )
When my fa@@ ther and I started a comp@@ any to 3@@ D pr@@ int human tis@@ su@@ es and org@@ ans , some people ini@@ ti@@ ally thought we were a little cra@@ z@@ y .
But sin@@ ce then , much pro@@ g@@ ress has been made , both in our lab and other la@@ b@@ s around the world .
And given this , we started getting ques@@ tions like , &quot; &quot; If you can grow human body par@@ ts , can you also grow animal produc@@ ts like me@@ at and lea@@ ther ? &quot; &quot; When someone first su@@ gg@@ es@@ ted this to me , quite f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly I thought they were a little cra@@ z@@ y , but what I so@@ on came to realiz@@ e was that this is not so cra@@ z@@ y after all .
What &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y is what we do today .
I &apos;m con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that in 30 years , when we look back on today and on how we rai@@ se and s@@ la@@ u@@ ghter bi@@ llions of animals to make our ha@@ mb@@ ur@@ g@@ ers and our han@@ d@@ b@@ ag@@ s , we &apos;ll see this as being was@@ te@@ ful and in@@ de@@ ed cra@@ z@@ y .
D@@ id you know that today we ma@@ in@@ tain a global her@@ d of 60 billion animals to pro@@ vi@@ de our me@@ at , da@@ ir@@ y , e@@ g@@ gs and lea@@ ther go@@ o@@ ds ?
And over the next few deca@@ des , as the world &apos;s population ex@@ pan@@ ds to 10 billion , this will need to ne@@ ar@@ ly dou@@ ble to 100 billion animals .
But ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ing this her@@ d takes a ma@@ j@@ or to@@ ll on our plan@@ et .
An@@ im@@ als are not just ra@@ w materi@@ als .
They &apos;re living be@@ ings , and already our li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck is one of the lar@@ g@@ est us@@ ers of land , f@@ res@@ h water , and one of the bi@@ gg@@ est produc@@ ers of gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases which dri@@ ve climate change .
O@@ n top of this , when you get so many animals so clo@@ se together , it cre@@ ates a bre@@ e@@ ding ground for disease and op@@ portuni@@ ties for har@@ m and ab@@ use .
C@@ lear@@ ly , we cannot continu@@ e on this pa@@ th which pu@@ ts the environment , publi@@ c health , and food se@@ curi@@ ty at ris@@ k .
There is another way , because es@@ senti@@ ally , animal produc@@ ts are just col@@ lec@@ tions of tis@@ su@@ es , and right now we bre@@ ed and rai@@ se high@@ ly comple@@ x animals only to create produc@@ ts that are made of rela@@ tively simple tis@@ su@@ es .
What if , instead of star@@ ting with a comple@@ x and senti@@ ent animal , we started with what the tis@@ su@@ es are made of , the ba@@ sic un@@ it of life , the cell ?
This is bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation , where cells themselves can be used to grow bio@@ logical produc@@ ts like tis@@ su@@ es and org@@ ans .
Al@@ ready in medic@@ ine , bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es have been used to grow so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted body par@@ ts , like ear@@ s , win@@ d@@ pi@@ pes , sk@@ in , blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s and b@@ one , that have been suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly imp@@ lan@@ ted into patients .
And be@@ y@@ on@@ d medic@@ ine , bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation can be a human@@ e , s@@ us@@ tain@@ able and s@@ cal@@ able new indu@@ stry .
And we should beg@@ in by re@@ imag@@ in@@ ing lea@@ ther .
I emp@@ ha@@ size lea@@ ther because it is so w@@ ide@@ ly used .
It is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our hist@@ ory .
G@@ ro@@ wing lea@@ ther is also tech@@ n@@ ic@@ ally simp@@ ler than gro@@ wing other animal produc@@ ts like me@@ at .
It ma@@ in@@ ly us@@ es one cell ty@@ pe , and it is lar@@ ge@@ ly tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al .
It is also less po@@ l@@ ari@@ zing for consu@@ m@@ ers and regu@@ la@@ tors .
Un@@ til bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation is better underst@@ o@@ od , it is c@@ lear that , ini@@ ti@@ ally at le@@ ast , more people would be wi@@ lling to we@@ ar no@@ vel materi@@ als than would be wi@@ lling to eat no@@ vel fo@@ o@@ ds , no matter how de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous .
In this sense , lea@@ ther is a ga@@ te@@ way material , a beg@@ in@@ ning for the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation indu@@ stry .
If we can suc@@ ce@@ ed here , it br@@ ings our other consu@@ m@@ er bio@@ produc@@ ts like me@@ at clo@@ ser on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on .
Now how do we do it ?
To grow lea@@ ther , we beg@@ in by taking cells from an animal , through a simple bi@@ op@@ s@@ y .
The animal could be a co@@ w , la@@ m@@ b , or even something more ex@@ o@@ tic .
This process does no har@@ m , and D@@ a@@ is@@ y the co@@ w can live a happ@@ y life .
We then i@@ so@@ late the sk@@ in cells and multi@@ p@@ ly them in a cell culture medi@@ um .
This takes mi@@ llions of cells and ex@@ pan@@ ds them into bi@@ llions .
And we then co@@ a@@ x these cells to produ@@ ce col@@ la@@ gen , as they would n@@ atur@@ ally .
This col@@ la@@ gen is the stuff between cells .
It &apos;s natural connec@@ tive tis@@ su@@ e .
It &apos;s the extra@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar ma@@ tri@@ x , but in lea@@ ther , it &apos;s the ma@@ in buil@@ ding blo@@ ck .
And what we next do is we take the cells and their col@@ la@@ gen and we s@@ pre@@ ad them out to form s@@ he@@ e@@ ts , and then we la@@ y@@ er these th@@ in s@@ he@@ e@@ ts on top of one another , like phy@@ llo pa@@ stry , to form th@@ ic@@ ker s@@ he@@ e@@ ts , which we then let ma@@ ture .
And finally , we take this multi@@ la@@ y@@ er@@ ed sk@@ in and through a sh@@ or@@ ter and much less che@@ mi@@ cal tan@@ ning process , we create lea@@ ther .
And so I &apos;m very exci@@ ted to show you , for the first time , the first bat@@ ch of our cul@@ tu@@ red lea@@ ther , f@@ res@@ h from the lab .
This is real , gen@@ u@@ ine lea@@ ther , without the animal sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce .
It can have all the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of lea@@ ther because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no ha@@ ir to re@@ move , no s@@ car@@ s or in@@ sec@@ t &apos;s b@@ it@@ es , and no was@@ te .
This lea@@ ther can be gro@@ wn in the s@@ hap@@ e of a wal@@ let , a han@@ d@@ ba@@ g or a car se@@ at .
It is not limi@@ ted to the ir@@ regu@@ lar s@@ hap@@ e of a co@@ w or an al@@ li@@ g@@ at@@ or .
And because we make this material , we grow this lea@@ ther from the ground up , we can control its pro@@ per@@ ties in very interesting ways .
This piece of lea@@ ther is a m@@ ere se@@ ven tis@@ su@@ e la@@ y@@ ers th@@ ick , and as you can see , it is ne@@ ar@@ ly trans@@ par@@ ent .
And this lea@@ ther is 2@@ 1 la@@ y@@ ers th@@ ick and quite o@@ pa@@ que .
You don &apos;t have that kind of fin@@ e control with conven@@ tional lea@@ ther .
And we can tun@@ e this lea@@ ther for other des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble qu@@ ali@@ ties , like sof@@ t@@ ness , bre@@ a@@ th@@ ability , du@@ ra@@ bility , e@@ la@@ sti@@ city and even things like pa@@ tter@@ n .
We can mi@@ mic n@@ ature , but in some ways also impro@@ ve u@@ po@@ n it .
This ty@@ pe of lea@@ ther can do what today &apos;s lea@@ ther does , but with imag@@ in@@ ation , probably much more .
What could the future of animal produc@@ ts look like ?
It need not look like this , which is actually the sta@@ te of the art today .
R@@ a@@ ther , it could be much more like this .
Al@@ ready , we have been man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing with cell cul@@ tures for thousands of years , beg@@ in@@ ning with produc@@ ts like w@@ ine , be@@ er and y@@ o@@ gur@@ t .
And spe@@ a@@ king of food , our cul@@ tu@@ red food has e@@ vol@@ ved , and today we pre@@ par@@ e cul@@ tu@@ red food in beautiful , ster@@ i@@ le faci@@ li@@ ties like this .
A bre@@ wer@@ y is es@@ senti@@ ally a bio@@ reac@@ tor .
It is where cell culture takes place .
Ima@@ g@@ ine that in this faci@@ li@@ ty , instead of bre@@ wing be@@ er , we were bre@@ wing lea@@ ther or me@@ at .
Ima@@ g@@ ine t@@ our@@ ing this faci@@ li@@ ty , learning about how the lea@@ ther or me@@ at is cul@@ tu@@ red , see@@ ing the process from beg@@ in@@ ning to end , and even trying some .
It &apos;s c@@ le@@ an , open and edu@@ ca@@ tional , and this is in contra@@ st to the hi@@ d@@ den , gu@@ ar@@ ded and re@@ m@@ ote fac@@ tori@@ es where lea@@ ther and me@@ at is produc@@ ed today .
Per@@ haps bi@@ of@@ abri@@ cation is a natural evolu@@ tion of man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing for man@@ kind .
It &apos;s environ@@ ment@@ ally respon@@ sible , ef@@ fici@@ ent and human@@ e .
It al@@ lo@@ ws us to be crea@@ tive .
We can desig@@ n new materi@@ als , new produc@@ ts , and new faci@@ li@@ ties .
We need to move pa@@ st just ki@@ lling animals as a res@@ our@@ ce to something more ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zed and e@@ vol@@ ved .
Per@@ haps we are ready for something liter@@ ally and fi@@ gu@@ ra@@ tively more cul@@ tu@@ red .
Thank you .

I &apos;m a gar@@ b@@ age man .
And you might find it interesting that I became a gar@@ b@@ age man , because I absolu@@ tely ha@@ te was@@ te .
I hope , within the next 10 minu@@ tes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beg@@ in@@ ning .
Th@@ in@@ k back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
Per@@ haps it was like these to@@ d@@ d@@ ler r@@ ul@@ es : It &apos;s my stuff if I saw it first .
The entire pi@@ le is my stuff if I &apos;m buil@@ ding something .
The more stuff that &apos;s min@@ e , the better .
And of course , it &apos;s your stuff if it &apos;s bro@@ ken .
( Laughter ) Well after s@@ pen@@ ding about 20 years in the rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling indu@@ stry , it &apos;s become pretty c@@ lear to me that we don &apos;t neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly lea@@ ve these to@@ d@@ d@@ ler r@@ ul@@ es be@@ hind as we develo@@ p into adul@@ ts .
And let me tell you why I have that per@@ spec@@ tive .
Because each and every day at our rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling plan@@ ts around the world we han@@ dle about one million po@@ unds of people &apos;s dis@@ car@@ ded stuff .
Now a million po@@ unds a day so@@ unds like a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a tin@@ y dro@@ p of the du@@ ra@@ ble go@@ o@@ ds that are dis@@ pos@@ ed each and every year around the world — well less than one percent .
In fact , the Uni@@ ted Na@@ tions esti@@ ma@@ tes that there &apos;s about 8@@ 5 billion po@@ unds a year of elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic@@ s was@@ te that gets dis@@ car@@ ded around the world each and every year — and that &apos;s one of the most ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly gro@@ wing par@@ ts of our was@@ te stre@@ am .
And if you th@@ row in other du@@ ra@@ ble go@@ o@@ ds like auto@@ mo@@ bi@@ les and so for@@ th , that number well more than dou@@ bles .
And of course , the more developed the country , the bi@@ gg@@ er these moun@@ ta@@ ins .
Now when you see these moun@@ ta@@ ins , most people think of gar@@ b@@ age .
We see ab@@ o@@ ve@@ -@@ ground min@@ es .
And the reason we see min@@ es is because there &apos;s a lot of valu@@ able ra@@ w materi@@ als that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
And it &apos;s be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly important that we figur@@ e out how to extra@@ c@@ t these ra@@ w materi@@ als from these extre@@ me@@ ly comp@@ lica@@ ted was@@ te stre@@ a@@ ms .
Because as we &apos;ve heard all wee@@ k at TED , the world &apos;s getting to be a s@@ mal@@ ler place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
And of course , they want the to@@ ys and the to@@ ols that many of us take for gran@@ ted .
And what goes into making those to@@ ys and to@@ ols that we use every single day ?
It &apos;s most@@ ly many ty@@ pes of pla@@ stics and many ty@@ pes of me@@ tal@@ s .
And the me@@ tal@@ s , we ty@@ pic@@ ally get from ore that we min@@ e in ever wi@@ den@@ ing min@@ es and ever de@@ e@@ pen@@ ing min@@ es around the world .
And the pla@@ stics , we get from oil , which we go to more re@@ m@@ ote lo@@ ca@@ tions and dri@@ ll ever de@@ e@@ per w@@ el@@ ls to extra@@ c@@ t .
And these prac@@ tic@@ es have signifi@@ can@@ t econo@@ mic and environ@@ mental imp@@ lica@@ tions that we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see today .
The good news is we are star@@ ting to reco@@ ver materi@@ als from our en@@ d-@@ of@@ -@@ life stuff and star@@ ting to rec@@ y@@ cle our en@@ d-@@ of@@ -@@ life stuff , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in re@@ gi@@ ons of the world like here in Europe that have rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling poli@@ ci@@ es in place that re@@ qui@@ re that this stuff be rec@@ y@@ c@@ led in a respon@@ sible man@@ ner .
Mo@@ st of what &apos;s extra@@ c@@ ted from our en@@ d-@@ of@@ -@@ life stuff , if it makes it to a rec@@ y@@ c@@ ler , are the me@@ tal@@ s .
To put that in per@@ spec@@ tive — and I &apos;m using ste@@ el as a pro@@ x@@ y here for me@@ tal@@ s , because it &apos;s the most common me@@ tal — if your stuff makes it to a rec@@ y@@ c@@ ler , probably over 90 percent of the me@@ tal@@ s are going to be reco@@ vered and re@@ used for another pur@@ pos@@ e .
P@@ la@@ stics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are reco@@ vered .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Mo@@ st of it &apos;s inc@@ in@@ er@@ ated or lan@@ d@@ fil@@ led .
Now most people think that &apos;s because pla@@ stics are a th@@ ro@@ w@@ -@@ away material , have very little valu@@ e .
But actually , pla@@ stics are se@@ ver@@ al times more valu@@ able than ste@@ el .
And there &apos;s more pla@@ stics produc@@ ed and consu@@ med around the world on a volu@@ me bas@@ is every year than ste@@ el .
So why is such a pl@@ enti@@ ful and valu@@ able material not reco@@ vered at any@@ where ne@@ ar the rate of the less valu@@ able material ?
Well it &apos;s pre@@ do@@ min@@ an@@ tly because me@@ tal@@ s are very e@@ as@@ y to rec@@ y@@ cle from other materi@@ als and from one another .
They have very different den@@ si@@ ties .
They have different elec@@ tri@@ cal and ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic pro@@ per@@ ties .
And they even have different col@@ ors .
So it &apos;s very e@@ as@@ y for ei@@ ther human@@ s or mach@@ in@@ es to separ@@ ate these me@@ tal@@ s from one another and from other materi@@ als .
P@@ la@@ stics have over@@ la@@ p@@ ping den@@ si@@ ties over a very n@@ ar@@ row ran@@ ge .
They have ei@@ ther iden@@ tical or very similar elec@@ tri@@ cal and ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic pro@@ per@@ ties .
And any pla@@ stic can be any col@@ or , as you probably well know .
So the tradi@@ tional ways of separ@@ ating materi@@ als just simply don &apos;t work for pla@@ stics .
A@@ no@@ ther conse@@ qu@@ ence of me@@ tal@@ s being so e@@ as@@ y to rec@@ y@@ cle by human@@ s is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world — and sa@@ d@@ ly to say , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly from the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , where we don &apos;t have any rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling poli@@ ci@@ es in place like here in Europe — fin@@ ds its way to develo@@ ping countries for low@@ -@@ co@@ st rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling .
People , for as little as a dol@@ lar a day , pic@@ k through our stuff .
They extra@@ c@@ t what they can , which is most@@ ly the me@@ tal@@ s — cir@@ cu@@ it bo@@ ar@@ ds and so for@@ th — and they lea@@ ve be@@ hind most@@ ly what they can &apos;t reco@@ ver , which is , again , most@@ ly the pla@@ stics .
O@@ r they bur@@ n the pla@@ stics to get to the me@@ tal@@ s in bur@@ n h@@ ou@@ ses like you see here .
And they extra@@ c@@ t the me@@ tal@@ s by hand .
Now while this may be the low@@ -@@ econo@@ mi@@ c@@ -@@ co@@ st solu@@ tion , this is cer@@ tain@@ ly not the low@@ -@@ environ@@ mental or human health@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ sa@@ fe@@ ty solu@@ tion .
I call this environ@@ mental ar@@ b@@ it@@ ra@@ ge .
And it &apos;s not fa@@ ir , it &apos;s not sa@@ fe and it &apos;s not s@@ us@@ tain@@ able .
Now because the pla@@ stics are so pl@@ enti@@ ful — and by the way , those other me@@ th@@ o@@ ds don &apos;t le@@ ad to the reco@@ very of pla@@ stics , obvi@@ ously — but people do try to reco@@ ver the pla@@ stics .
This is just one example .
This is a p@@ ho@@ to I took stan@@ ding on the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps of one of the lar@@ g@@ est s@@ lu@@ ms in the world in Mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i , In@@ dia .
They st@@ ore the pla@@ stics on the ro@@ of@@ s .
They br@@ ing them be@@ low those ro@@ of@@ s into small wor@@ k@@ sho@@ ps like these , and people try very hard to separ@@ ate the pla@@ stics , by col@@ or , by s@@ hap@@ e , by feel , by any tech@@ ni@@ que they can .
And sometimes they &apos;ll res@@ or@@ t to what &apos;s kno@@ wn as the &quot; &quot; bur@@ n and s@@ ni@@ ff &quot; &quot; tech@@ ni@@ que where they &apos;ll bur@@ n the pla@@ stic and s@@ me@@ ll the fu@@ mes to try to determin@@ e the ty@@ pe of pla@@ stic .
N@@ one of these tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es resul@@ t in any amount of rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling in any signifi@@ can@@ t way .
And by the way , ple@@ ase don &apos;t try this tech@@ ni@@ que at home .
So what are we to do about this sp@@ ace@@ -@@ age material , at le@@ ast what we used to call a sp@@ ace@@ -@@ ag@@ ed material , these pla@@ stics ?
Well I cer@@ tain@@ ly believe that it &apos;s far too valu@@ able and far too ab@@ und@@ ant to keep pu@@ tting back in the ground or cer@@ tain@@ ly sen@@ d up in s@@ mo@@ ke .
So about 20 years ago , I liter@@ ally started in my gar@@ age tin@@ k@@ er@@ ing around , trying to figur@@ e out how to separ@@ ate these very similar materi@@ als from each other , and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally en@@ li@@ s@@ ted a lot of my fri@@ ends , in the min@@ ing world actually , and in the pla@@ stics world , and we started going around to min@@ ing laboratori@@ es around the world .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing ab@@ o@@ ve@@ -@@ ground min@@ ing .
And we ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally bro@@ ke the co@@ de .
This is the last fron@@ ti@@ er of rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling .
It &apos;s the last ma@@ j@@ or material to be reco@@ vered in any signifi@@ can@@ t amount on the Earth .
And we finally fi@@ gu@@ red out how to do it .
And in the process , we started re@@ cre@@ ating how the pla@@ stics indu@@ stry makes pla@@ stics .
The tradi@@ tional way to make pla@@ stics is with oil or pe@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal@@ s .
You bre@@ a@@ k@@ down the mole@@ cul@@ es , you re@@ com@@ b@@ ine them in very speci@@ fic ways , to make all the wonderful pla@@ stics that we en@@ jo@@ y each and every day .
We said , there &apos;s got to be a more s@@ us@@ tain@@ able way to make pla@@ stics .
And not just s@@ us@@ tain@@ able from an environ@@ mental stan@@ d@@ point , s@@ us@@ tain@@ able from an econo@@ mic stan@@ d@@ point as well .
Well a good place to start is with was@@ te .
It cer@@ tain@@ ly doesn &apos;t co@@ st as much as oil , and it &apos;s pl@@ enti@@ ful , as I hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s .
And because we &apos;re not bre@@ a@@ king down the pla@@ stic into mole@@ cul@@ es and re@@ com@@ bin@@ ing them , we &apos;re using a min@@ ing appro@@ ach to extra@@ c@@ t the materi@@ als .
We have signifi@@ can@@ tly lo@@ wer ca@@ pi@@ tal co@@ sts in our pl@@ ant equi@@ p@@ ment .
We have enor@@ mous energy sa@@ v@@ ings .
I don &apos;t know how many other pro@@ jects on the plan@@ et right now can sa@@ ve 80 to 90 percent of the energy compar@@ ed to making something the tradi@@ tional way .
And instead of p@@ lo@@ p@@ ping down se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d million dollars to build a che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant that will only make one ty@@ pe of pla@@ stic for its entire life , our plan@@ ts can make any ty@@ pe of pla@@ stic we fe@@ ed them .
And we make a dro@@ p@@ -@@ in re@@ pl@@ ace@@ ment for that pla@@ stic that &apos;s made from pe@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal@@ s .
Ou@@ r cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers get to en@@ jo@@ y hu@@ ge C@@ O@@ 2 sa@@ v@@ ings .
They get to clo@@ se the loo@@ p with their produc@@ ts .
And they get to make more s@@ us@@ tain@@ able produc@@ ts .
In the sh@@ or@@ t time peri@@ od I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
It star@@ ts with me@@ tal rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ers who sh@@ red our stuff into very small b@@ its .
They reco@@ ver the me@@ tal@@ s and lea@@ ve be@@ hind what &apos;s called sh@@ re@@ d@@ der res@@ i@@ du@@ e — it &apos;s their was@@ te — a very comple@@ x mi@@ x@@ ture of materi@@ als , but pre@@ do@@ min@@ an@@ tly pla@@ stics .
We take out the things that ar@@ en &apos;t pla@@ stics , such as the me@@ tal@@ s they mis@@ sed , car@@ pe@@ ting , fo@@ am , ru@@ b@@ b@@ er , wo@@ od , g@@ la@@ ss , pa@@ per , you name it .
E@@ ven an oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ al de@@ ad animal , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately .
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like tradi@@ tional rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling .
We &apos;re si@@ e@@ ving the material , we &apos;re using ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts , we &apos;re using air cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ cation .
It loo@@ ks like the W@@ il@@ ly W@@ on@@ k@@ a fac@@ t@@ ory at this point .
A@@ t the end of this process , we have a mi@@ x@@ ed pla@@ stic com@@ posi@@ te : many different ty@@ pes of pla@@ stics and many different gra@@ des of pla@@ stics .
This goes into the more so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted part of our process , and the really hard work , multi@@ -@@ ste@@ p separ@@ ation process beg@@ ins .
We gr@@ ind the pla@@ stic down to about the size of your small f@@ ing@@ er@@ na@@ il .
We use a very high@@ ly auto@@ ma@@ ted process to sort those pla@@ stics , not only by ty@@ pe , but by gra@@ de .
And out the end of that part of the process come little f@@ la@@ kes of pla@@ stic : one ty@@ pe , one gra@@ de .
We then use op@@ tical sor@@ ting to col@@ or sort this material .
We b@@ l@@ end it in 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ b@@ . b@@ len@@ ding si@@ los .
We p@@ us@@ h that material to ex@@ tru@@ ders where we mel@@ t it , p@@ us@@ h it through small di@@ e h@@ ol@@ es , make s@@ pa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ -@@ like pla@@ stic st@@ ran@@ ds .
And we cho@@ p those st@@ ran@@ ds into what are called pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts .
And this be@@ comes the cur@@ ren@@ cy of the pla@@ stics indu@@ stry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
And today , we &apos;re produc@@ ing it from your old stuff , and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
( Applause ) So now , instead of your stuff en@@ ding up on a hi@@ ll@@ side in a develo@@ ping country or liter@@ ally going up in s@@ mo@@ ke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your des@@ k in new produc@@ ts , in your of@@ fi@@ ce , or back at work in your home .
And these are just a few examp@@ les of comp@@ ani@@ es that are bu@@ ying our pla@@ stic , re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing vir@@ g@@ in pla@@ stic , to make their new produc@@ ts .
So I hope I &apos;ve chan@@ ged the way you look at at le@@ ast some of the stuff in your life .
We took our c@@ lu@@ es from mother n@@ ature .
M@@ other n@@ ature wa@@ st@@ es very little , re@@ us@@ es prac@@ tically everything .
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consu@@ m@@ er — that &apos;s a la@@ bel I &apos;ve always ha@@ ted my entire life — and think of yourself as just using res@@ our@@ ces in one form , until they can be trans@@ for@@ med to another form for another use later in time .
And finally , I hope you ag@@ ree with me to change that last to@@ d@@ d@@ ler ru@@ le just a little bit to : &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s bro@@ ken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot; &quot; Thank you for your time .
( Applause )
I w@@ r@@ ote a le@@ tter last wee@@ k talking about the work of the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion , shar@@ ing some of the problems .
And W@@ ar@@ ren B@@ u@@ f@@ fe@@ t had re@@ com@@ men@@ ded I do that — being hon@@ est about what was going well , what was@@ n &apos;t , and making it kind of an an@@ nu@@ al thing .
A go@@ al I had there was to dra@@ w more people in to work on those problems , because I think there are some very important problems that don &apos;t get worked on n@@ atur@@ ally .
And only by pa@@ ying attention to these things and having bri@@ lli@@ ant people who care and dra@@ w other people in can we make as much pro@@ g@@ ress as we need to .
So this mor@@ ning I &apos;m going to share two of these problems and talk about where they st@@ and .
But before I di@@ ve into those I want to ad@@ mi@@ t that I am an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st .
So that &apos;s a fac@@ tor of two re@@ duc@@ tion of the chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od death rate .
It &apos;s a ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al thing .
E@@ ach one of those lives ma@@ t@@ ters a lot .
And the k@@ ey reason we were able to it was not only ri@@ sing in@@ comes but also a few k@@ ey bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s : vac@@ cin@@ es that were used more w@@ ide@@ ly .
For example , meas@@ les was four million of the de@@ a@@ ths back as rec@@ ently as 19@@ 90 and now is under 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 .
So we really can make chan@@ ges .
The next bre@@ a@@ k@@ through is to c@@ ut that 10 million in half again .
And I think that &apos;s do@@ able in well under 20 years .
So that br@@ ings us to the first problem that I &apos;ll rai@@ se this mor@@ ning , which is how do we stop a de@@ ad@@ ly disease that &apos;s s@@ pre@@ ad by mos@@ qu@@ itos ?
Well , what &apos;s the hist@@ ory of this disease ?
It &apos;s been a se@@ ver@@ e disease for thousands of years .
In fact , if we look at the genetic co@@ de , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who li@@ ved in Africa actually e@@ vol@@ ved se@@ ver@@ al things to a@@ vo@@ id mal@@ ari@@ al de@@ a@@ ths .
De@@ a@@ ths actually pe@@ a@@ ked at a bit over five million in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s .
So it was absolu@@ tely gi@@ g@@ anti@@ c .
And the disease was all over the world .
A terri@@ ble disease . It was in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes . It was in Europe .
People didn &apos;t know what ca@@ used it until the early 19@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , when a Bri@@ ti@@ sh mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y man fi@@ gu@@ red out that it was mos@@ qu@@ itos .
So it was every@@ where .
And two to@@ ols hel@@ ped br@@ ing the death rate down .
Now , i@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally , what happened was it was eli@@ min@@ ated from all the tem@@ per@@ ate z@@ ones , which is where the ri@@ ch countries are .
So we can see : 19@@ 00 , it &apos;s every@@ where .
19@@ 4@@ 5 , it &apos;s still most places .
19@@ 70 , the U.@@ S@@ . and most of Europe have g@@ ot@@ ten ri@@ d of it .
19@@ 90 , you &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten most of the nor@@ ther@@ n are@@ as .
And so this le@@ ads to the par@@ ado@@ x that because the disease is only in the po@@ o@@ rer countries , it doesn &apos;t get much inv@@ est@@ ment .
For example , there &apos;s more money put into bal@@ d@@ ness drugs than are put into mal@@ aria .
Now , bal@@ d@@ ness , it &apos;s a terri@@ ble thing .
( Laughter ) And ri@@ ch men are af@@ fli@@ c@@ ted .
And so that &apos;s why that pri@@ or@@ ity has been set .
But , mal@@ aria — even the million de@@ a@@ ths a year ca@@ used by mal@@ aria gre@@ at@@ ly under@@ sta@@ te its impac@@ t .
O@@ ver 200 million people at any one time are suf@@ fer@@ ing from it .
It means that you can &apos;t get the econo@@ mi@@ es in these are@@ as going because it just h@@ ol@@ ds things back so much .
We &apos;ll let those ro@@ am around the audi@@ tori@@ um a little bit .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s no reason only po@@ or people should have the experience .
And when you use in@@ do@@ or sp@@ ra@@ ying with D@@ D@@ T and those ne@@ ts you can c@@ ut de@@ a@@ ths by over 50 percent .
And that &apos;s happened now in a number of countries .
It &apos;s great to see .
But we have to be car@@ e@@ ful because mal@@ aria — the par@@ asi@@ te e@@ vol@@ ves and the mos@@ qu@@ ito e@@ vol@@ ves .
So every to@@ ol that we &apos;ve ever had in the pa@@ st has ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally become in@@ effec@@ tive .
And so you end up with two cho@@ ic@@ es .
If you go into a country with the right to@@ ols and the right way , you do it vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously , you can actually get a lo@@ cal er@@ adi@@ cation .
And that &apos;s where we saw the mal@@ aria ma@@ p sh@@ r@@ in@@ king .
O@@ r , if you go in kind of hal@@ f-@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ly , for a peri@@ od of time you &apos;ll redu@@ ce the disease bur@@ den , but ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally those to@@ ols will become in@@ effec@@ tive , and the death rate will so@@ ar back up again .
And the world has g@@ one through this where it pa@@ id attention and then didn &apos;t pa@@ y attention .
Now we &apos;re on the u@@ p@@ s@@ wing .
B@@ ed net fun@@ ding is up .
There &apos;s new drug disco@@ very going on .
Ou@@ r fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion has bac@@ ked a vac@@ c@@ ine that &apos;s going into p@@ ha@@ se three tri@@ al that star@@ ts in a cou@@ ple months .
And that should sa@@ ve over two th@@ ir@@ ds of the lives if it &apos;s effec@@ tive .
So we &apos;re going to have these new to@@ ols .
But that al@@ one doesn &apos;t give us the ro@@ ad ma@@ p .
Because the ro@@ ad ma@@ p to get ri@@ d of this disease invol@@ ves many things .
It invol@@ ves communi@@ ca@@ tors to keep the fun@@ ding high , to keep the visi@@ bility high , to tell the suc@@ cess stories .
It invol@@ ves social scienti@@ sts , so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed ne@@ ts , but 90 percent .
We need ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ ans to come in and si@@ mu@@ late this , to do M@@ on@@ te Car@@ lo things to understand how these to@@ ols com@@ b@@ ine and work together .
O@@ f course we need drug comp@@ ani@@ es to give us their ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se .
We need ri@@ ch@@ -@@ world govern@@ ments to be very gener@@ ous in pro@@ vi@@ ding a@@ id for these things .
And so as these ele@@ ments come together , I &apos;m quite op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic that we will be able to er@@ adi@@ cate mal@@ aria .
Now let me turn to a second question , a fa@@ ir@@ ly different question , but I &apos;d say equ@@ ally important .
And this is : How do you make a teach@@ er great ?
It see@@ ms like the kind of question that people would s@@ pen@@ d a lot of time on , and we &apos;d understand very well .
And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s start with why this is important .
Well , all of us here , I &apos;ll be@@ t , had some great teachers .
We all had a wonderful education .
That &apos;s part of the reason we &apos;re here today , part of the reason we &apos;re suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful .
I can say that , even though I &apos;m a colle@@ ge dro@@ p@@ -@@ out .
I had great teachers .
In fact , in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , the teach@@ ing system has worked fa@@ ir@@ ly well .
There are fa@@ ir@@ ly effec@@ tive teachers in a n@@ ar@@ row set of places .
So the top 20 percent of stud@@ ents have g@@ ot@@ ten a good education .
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you meas@@ ure them aga@@ in@@ st the other top 20 percent .
And they &apos;ve g@@ one on to create the re@@ volu@@ tions in sof@@ tw@@ are and bio@@ technology and keep the U.@@ S@@ . at the fo@@ re@@ front .
Now , the str@@ eng@@ th for those top 20 percent is star@@ ting to fa@@ de on a rela@@ tive bas@@ is , but even more con@@ cer@@ ning is the education that the bal@@ ance of people are getting .
No@@ t only has that been we@@ a@@ k@@ . it &apos;s getting we@@ a@@ ker .
And if you look at the econo@@ my , it really is only pro@@ vi@@ ding op@@ portuni@@ ties now to people with a better education .
And we have to change this .
We have to change it so that people have equ@@ al op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
We have to change it so that the country is st@@ rong and sta@@ ys at the fo@@ re@@ front of things that are dri@@ ven by ad@@ van@@ ced education , like science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics .
When I first learned the sta@@ ti@@ stics , I was pretty st@@ un@@ ned at how bad things are .
O@@ ver 30 percent of kids never fin@@ is@@ h high school .
And that had been co@@ vered up for a long time because they always took the dro@@ po@@ ut rate as the number who started in sen@@ i@@ or year and compar@@ ed it to the number who fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed sen@@ i@@ or year .
Because they wer@@ en &apos;t tra@@ c@@ king where the kids were before that .
But most of the dro@@ po@@ u@@ ts had ta@@ ken place before that .
They had to rai@@ se the sta@@ ted dro@@ po@@ ut rate as so@@ on as that tra@@ c@@ king was done to over 30 percent .
For min@@ or@@ ity kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
And even if you gra@@ du@@ ate from high school , if you &apos;re low@@ -@@ in@@ come , you have less than a 25 percent chan@@ ce of ever comple@@ ting a colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e .
If you &apos;re low@@ -@@ in@@ come in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , you have a high@@ er chan@@ ce of going to j@@ a@@ il than you do of getting a f@@ our@@ -@@ year de@@ gre@@ e .
And that doesn &apos;t see@@ m enti@@ re@@ ly fa@@ ir .
So , how do you make education better ?
Now , our fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion , for the last n@@ ine years , has inv@@ es@@ ted in this .
There &apos;s many people working on it .
We &apos;ve worked on small s@@ cho@@ ols , we &apos;ve fun@@ ded sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ ps , we &apos;ve done things in li@@ br@@ ari@@ es .
A lot of these things had a good effec@@ t .
But the more we looked at it , the more we realiz@@ ed that having great teachers was the very k@@ ey thing .
And we ho@@ o@@ ked up with some people stud@@ ying how much vari@@ ation is there between teachers , between , say , the top qu@@ arti@@ le — the very best — and the bot@@ to@@ m qu@@ arti@@ le .
How much vari@@ ation is there within a school or between s@@ cho@@ ols ?
And the answer is that these vari@@ ations are absolu@@ tely un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
A top qu@@ arti@@ le teach@@ er will incre@@ ase the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of their cla@@ ss — based on test s@@ cor@@ es — by over 10 percent in a single year .
What does that mean ?
That means that if the entire U.@@ S@@ . , for two years , had top qu@@ arti@@ le teachers , the entire differ@@ ence between us and A@@ si@@ a would go away .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in four years we would be blo@@ wing everyone in the world away .
So , it &apos;s simple . All you need are those top qu@@ arti@@ le teachers .
And so you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we should re@@ ward those people .
We should re@@ tain those people .
We should find out what they &apos;re doing and trans@@ fer that sk@@ ill to other people . &quot; &quot; But I can tell you that absolu@@ tely is not happen@@ ing today .
What are the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of this top qu@@ arti@@ le ?
What do they look like ?
You might think these must be very sen@@ i@@ or teachers .
And the answer is no .
O@@ n@@ ce somebody has ta@@ u@@ ght for three years their teach@@ ing qu@@ ality does not change ther@@ e@@ after .
The vari@@ ation is very , very small .
You might think these are people with mas@@ ter &apos;s de@@ gre@@ es .
They &apos;ve g@@ one back and they &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten their M@@ as@@ ter &apos;s of E@@ du@@ cation .
This char@@ t takes four different fac@@ tors and says how much do they ex@@ pla@@ in teach@@ ing qu@@ ality .
That bot@@ to@@ m thing , which says there &apos;s no effec@@ t at all , is a mas@@ ter &apos;s de@@ gre@@ e .
Now , the way the pa@@ y system works is there &apos;s two things that are re@@ war@@ ded .
One is sen@@ i@@ or@@ ity .
Because your pa@@ y goes up and you v@@ est into your pen@@ sion .
The second is gi@@ ving ex@@ tra money to people who get their mas@@ ter &apos;s de@@ gre@@ e .
But it in no way is as@@ soci@@ ated with being a better teach@@ er .
T@@ each for America : s@@ light effec@@ t .
For ma@@ th teachers ma@@ j@@ or@@ ing in ma@@ th there &apos;s a meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble effec@@ t .
But , over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing@@ ly , it &apos;s your pa@@ st per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
There are some people who are very good at this .
And we &apos;ve done almost nothing to study what that is and to dra@@ w it in and to re@@ pli@@ cate it , to rai@@ se the a@@ ver@@ age cap@@ ability — or to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the people with it to sta@@ y in the system .
You might say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o the good teachers sta@@ y and the bad teach@@ er &apos;s lea@@ ve ? &quot; &quot; The answer is , on a@@ ver@@ age , the sli@@ gh@@ tly better teachers lea@@ ve the system .
And it &apos;s a system with very high tur@@ no@@ ver .
Now , there are a few places — very few — where great teachers are being made .
A good example of one is a set of char@@ ter s@@ cho@@ ols called K@@ I@@ P@@ P .
K@@ I@@ P@@ P means K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge I@@ s Po@@ wer .
It &apos;s an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able thing .
They have 6@@ 6 s@@ cho@@ ols — most@@ ly mi@@ d@@ dle s@@ cho@@ ols , some high s@@ cho@@ ols — and what goes on is great teach@@ ing .
They take the po@@ or@@ est kids , and over 9@@ 6 percent of their high school gra@@ du@@ ates go to f@@ our@@ -@@ year colle@@ ges .
And the whole spi@@ ri@@ t and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de in those s@@ cho@@ ols is very different than in the normal publi@@ c s@@ cho@@ ols .
They &apos;re te@@ am teach@@ ing . They &apos;re con@@ stan@@ tly impro@@ ving their teachers .
They &apos;re taking data , the test s@@ cor@@ es , and saying to a teach@@ er , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , you ca@@ used this amount of incre@@ ase . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re de@@ e@@ p@@ ly eng@@ ag@@ ed in making teach@@ ing better .
When you actually go and si@@ t in one of these cla@@ s@@ s@@ roo@@ ms , at first it &apos;s very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re .
I s@@ at down and I thought , &quot; &quot; What is going on ? &quot; &quot; The teach@@ er was run@@ ning around , and the energy level was high .
I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the s@@ por@@ ts r@@ ally or something .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the teach@@ er was con@@ stan@@ tly s@@ can@@ ning to see which kids wer@@ en &apos;t pa@@ ying attention , which kids were bo@@ red , and cal@@ ling kids ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly , pu@@ tting things up on the bo@@ ard .
It was a very dy@@ na@@ mic environment , because partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in those mi@@ d@@ dle school years — fi@@ f@@ th through ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de — ke@@ e@@ ping people eng@@ ag@@ ed and se@@ tting the t@@ one that every@@ body in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room nee@@ ds to pa@@ y attention , no@@ body gets to make f@@ un of it or have the posi@@ tion of the kid who doesn &apos;t want to be there .
E@@ very@@ body nee@@ ds to be invol@@ ved .
And so K@@ I@@ P@@ P is doing it .
How does that compar@@ e to a normal school ?
Well , in a normal school , teachers ar@@ en &apos;t told how good they are .
The data isn &apos;t ga@@ ther@@ ed .
In the teach@@ er &apos;s contra@@ c@@ t , it will limi@@ t the number of times the princi@@ p@@ al can come into the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room — sometimes to on@@ ce per year .
And they need ad@@ van@@ ced no@@ tice to do that .
So imagine run@@ ning a fac@@ t@@ ory where you &apos;ve got these wor@@ kers , some of them just making cra@@ p and the man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment is told , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , you can only come down here on@@ ce a year , but you need to let us know , because we might actually fo@@ ol you , and try and do a good job in that one bri@@ e@@ f moment . &quot; &quot; E@@ ven a teach@@ er who wan@@ ts to impro@@ ve doesn &apos;t have the to@@ ols to do it .
They don &apos;t have the test s@@ cor@@ es , and there &apos;s a whole thing of trying to blo@@ ck the data .
For example , Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k pas@@ sed a la@@ w that said that the teach@@ er impro@@ ve@@ ment data could not be made a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble and used in the ten@@ ure deci@@ sion for the teachers .
And so that &apos;s sort of working in the op@@ posi@@ te direc@@ tion .
But I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic about this , I think there are some c@@ lear things we can do .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , there &apos;s a lot more t@@ esting going on , and that &apos;s given us the picture of where we are .
And that al@@ lo@@ ws us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es are .
O@@ f course , di@@ gi@@ tal video is che@@ a@@ p now .
P@@ u@@ tting a few ca@@ mer@@ as in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room and saying that things are being recor@@ ded on an on@@ going bas@@ is is very prac@@ tical in all publi@@ c s@@ cho@@ ols .
And so every few wee@@ ks teachers could si@@ t down and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , here &apos;s a little cli@@ p of something I thought I did well .
Here &apos;s a little cli@@ p of something I think I did po@@ or@@ ly .
A@@ d@@ vi@@ se me — when this kid ac@@ ted up , how should I have de@@ al@@ t with that ? &quot; &quot; And they could all si@@ t and work together on those problems .
You can take the very best teachers and kind of an@@ n@@ ot@@ ate it , have it so everyone se@@ es who is the very best at teach@@ ing this stuff .
You can take those great cour@@ ses and make them a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble so that a kid could go out and wat@@ ch the physi@@ cs course , learn from that .
If you have a kid who &apos;s be@@ hind , you would know you could as@@ si@@ g@@ n them that video to wat@@ ch and re@@ vie@@ w the concep@@ t .
And in fact , these f@@ ree cour@@ ses could not only be a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble just on the Internet , but you could make it so that D@@ V@@ D@@ s were always a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble , and so any@@ body who has ac@@ cess to a D@@ V@@ D play@@ er can have the very best teachers .
And so by thinking of this as a person@@ ne@@ l system , we can do it much better .
Now there &apos;s a book actually , about K@@ I@@ P@@ P — the place that this is going on — that J@@ ay M@@ at@@ the@@ ws , a news re@@ por@@ ter , w@@ r@@ ote — called , &quot; &quot; W@@ or@@ k H@@ ard , B@@ e N@@ ice . &quot; &quot; And I thought it was so fan@@ ta@@ stic .
It ga@@ ve you a sense of what a good teach@@ er does .
I &apos;m going to sen@@ d everyone here a f@@ ree co@@ p@@ y of this book .
( Applause ) Now , we put a lot of money into education , and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as st@@ rong a future as it should have .
In fact we have in the sti@@ mul@@ us bi@@ ll — it &apos;s interesting — the H@@ ouse ver@@ sion actually had money in it for these data syste@@ ms , and it was ta@@ ken out in the S@@ en@@ ate because there are people who are th@@ re@@ aten@@ ed by these things .
But I — I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic .
I think people are beg@@ in@@ ning to recogni@@ ze how important this is , and it really can make a differ@@ ence for mi@@ llions of lives , if we get it right .
I only had time to fra@@ me those two problems .
There &apos;s a lot more problems like that — A@@ I@@ D@@ S , p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia — I can just see you &apos;re getting exci@@ ted , just at the very name of these things .
And the sk@@ ill se@@ ts re@@ qui@@ red to tac@@ k@@ le these things are very bro@@ ad .
You know , the system doesn &apos;t n@@ atur@@ ally make it happen .
G@@ o@@ vern@@ ments don &apos;t n@@ atur@@ ally pic@@ k these things in the right way .
The priva@@ te sec@@ tor doesn &apos;t n@@ atur@@ ally put its res@@ our@@ ces into these things .
So it &apos;s going to take bri@@ lli@@ ant people like you to study these things , get other people invol@@ ved — and you &apos;re hel@@ ping to come up with solu@@ tions .
And with that , I think there &apos;s some great things that will come out of it .
Thank you .

When I was gro@@ wing up in M@@ on@@ tan@@ a , I had two dre@@ a@@ ms .
I wanted to be a pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , a dinosa@@ u@@ r pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , and I wanted to have a pe@@ t dinosa@@ u@@ r .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been stri@@ ving for all of my life .
I was very for@@ tun@@ ate early in my car@@ e@@ er .
I was for@@ tun@@ ate in fin@@ ding things .
I was@@ n &apos;t very good at read@@ ing things .
In fact , I don &apos;t read much of anything .
I am extre@@ me@@ ly dy@@ s@@ le@@ xi@@ c , and so read@@ ing is the har@@ des@@ t thing I do .
But instead , I go out and I find things .
Then I just pic@@ k things up .
I basi@@ cally prac@@ tice for fin@@ ding money on the stre@@ et .
( Laughter ) And I wan@@ der about the hi@@ lls , and I have found a few things .
And I have been for@@ tun@@ ate enough to find things like the first e@@ g@@ gs in the W@@ est@@ er@@ n he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere and the first bab@@ y dinosaur@@ s in n@@ est@@ s , the first dinosa@@ u@@ r em@@ br@@ y@@ os and mas@@ sive ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tions of b@@ ones .
And it happened to be at a time when people were just star@@ ting to beg@@ in to realiz@@ e that dinosaur@@ s wer@@ en &apos;t the big , stu@@ pi@@ d , green re@@ p@@ ti@@ les that people had thought for so many years .
People were star@@ ting to get an idea that dinosaur@@ s were spe@@ cial .
And so , at that time , I was able to make some interesting hy@@ po@@ th@@ eses al@@ ong with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es .
We were able to actually say that dinosaur@@ s — based on the evi@@ den@@ ce we had — that dinosaur@@ s buil@@ t n@@ est@@ s and li@@ ved in co@@ lon@@ ies and car@@ ed for their young , b@@ rou@@ ght food to their bab@@ ies and tra@@ ve@@ led in gi@@ g@@ anti@@ c her@@ ds .
So it was pretty interesting stuff .
I have g@@ one on to find more things and disco@@ ver that dinosaur@@ s really were very social .
We have found a lot of evi@@ den@@ ce that dinosaur@@ s chan@@ ged from when they were j@@ u@@ ven@@ il@@ es to when they were adul@@ ts .
The ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance of them would have been different — which it is in all social animals .
In social g@@ rou@@ ps of animals , the j@@ u@@ ven@@ il@@ es always look different than the adul@@ ts .
The adul@@ ts can recogni@@ ze the j@@ u@@ ven@@ il@@ es ; the j@@ u@@ ven@@ il@@ es can recogni@@ ze the adul@@ ts .
And so we &apos;re making a better picture of what a dinosa@@ u@@ r loo@@ ks like .
And they didn &apos;t just all cha@@ se J@@ e@@ e@@ ps around .
( Laughter ) But it is that social thing that I gu@@ ess at@@ tra@@ c@@ ted M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el C@@ ri@@ ch@@ ton .
And in his book , he tal@@ ked about the social animals .
And then Ste@@ ven S@@ pi@@ el@@ ber@@ g , of course , de@@ pic@@ ts these dinosaur@@ s as being very social cre@@ atur@@ es .
The the@@ me of this story is buil@@ ding a dinosa@@ u@@ r , and so we come to that part of &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ ra@@ s@@ sic Par@@ k . &quot; &quot; M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el C@@ ri@@ ch@@ ton really was one of the first people to talk about br@@ ing@@ ing dinosaur@@ s back to life .
You all know the story , right .
I mean , I as@@ su@@ me everyone here has seen &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ ra@@ s@@ sic Par@@ k . &quot; &quot; If you want to make a dinosa@@ u@@ r , you go out , you find yourself a piece of pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed t@@ ree sa@@ p — o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se kno@@ wn as a@@ mber — that has some bloo@@ d-@@ suc@@ king in@@ sec@@ ts in it , good ones , and you get your in@@ sec@@ t and you dri@@ ll into it and you su@@ ck out some DNA , because obvi@@ ously all in@@ sec@@ ts that suc@@ ked blood in those days suc@@ ked dinosa@@ u@@ r DNA out .
And you take your DNA back to the labor@@ at@@ ory and you cl@@ one it .
And I gu@@ ess you in@@ ject it into maybe an o@@ stri@@ ch e@@ g@@ g , or something like that , and then you wa@@ it , and , lo and be@@ h@@ old , out po@@ ps a little bab@@ y dinosa@@ u@@ r .
And every@@ body &apos;s happ@@ y about that .
( Laughter ) And they &apos;re happ@@ y over and over again .
They keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
And then , then , then , and then ...
Then the dinosaur@@ s , being social , ac@@ t out their soci@@ al@@ ness , and they get together , and they con@@ spi@@ re .
And , of course , that &apos;s what makes Ste@@ ven S@@ pi@@ el@@ ber@@ g &apos;s mo@@ vi@@ e — con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing dinosaur@@ s cha@@ sing people around .
So I as@@ su@@ me every@@ body kno@@ ws that if you actually had a piece of a@@ mber and it had an in@@ sec@@ t in it , and you dri@@ l@@ led into it , and you got something out of that in@@ sec@@ t , and you c@@ lon@@ ed it , and you did it over and over and over again , you &apos;d have a room full of mos@@ qu@@ itos .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And probably a whole bun@@ ch of tre@@ es as well .
Now if you want dinosa@@ u@@ r DNA , I say go to the dinosa@@ u@@ r .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
B@@ ack in 19@@ 9@@ 3 when the mo@@ vi@@ e came out , we actually had a gr@@ ant from the Na@@ tional S@@ ci@@ ence Fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion to at@@ temp@@ t to extra@@ c@@ t DNA from a dinosa@@ u@@ r , and we ch@@ ose the dinosa@@ u@@ r on the left , a T@@ y@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , which was a very n@@ ice speci@@ men .
And one of my for@@ m@@ er doc@@ tor@@ al stud@@ ents , D@@ r. Mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ we@@ it@@ z@@ er , actually had the bac@@ k@@ ground to do this sort of thing .
And so she looked into the b@@ one of this T@@ . re@@ x , one of the th@@ i@@ gh b@@ ones , and she actually found some very interesting struc@@ tures in there .
They found these red cir@@ cul@@ ar@@ -@@ looking ob@@ jects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
And they &apos;re in what ap@@ pe@@ ar to be the blood chan@@ n@@ els that go through the b@@ one .
And so she thought , well , what the h@@ ec@@ k .
So she sa@@ mp@@ led some material out of it .
Now it was@@ n &apos;t DNA ; she didn &apos;t find DNA .
But she did find he@@ me , which is the bio@@ logical fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in .
And that was really co@@ ol .
That was interesting .
That was — here we have 6@@ 5@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ year@@ -old he@@ me .
Well we tri@@ ed and tri@@ ed and we coul@@ dn &apos;t really get anything else out of it .
So a few years went by , and then we started the H@@ ell C@@ ree@@ k Pro@@ ject .
And the H@@ ell C@@ ree@@ k Pro@@ ject was this mas@@ sive under@@ taking to get as many dinosaur@@ s as we could pos@@ si@@ bly find , and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly find some dinosaur@@ s that had more material in them .
And out in e@@ a@@ ster@@ n M@@ on@@ tan@@ a there &apos;s a lot of space , a lot of b@@ ad@@ lan@@ ds , and not very many people , and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
And we did find a lot of stuff .
We found a lot of T@@ y@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ s , but we found one spe@@ cial T@@ y@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ u@@ r , and we called it B@@ -@@ re@@ x .
And B@@ -@@ re@@ x was found under a thou@@ s@@ and cu@@ bi@@ c y@@ ar@@ ds of ro@@ ck .
It was@@ n &apos;t a very comple@@ te T@@ . re@@ x , and it was@@ n &apos;t a very big T@@ . re@@ x , but it was a very spe@@ cial B@@ -@@ re@@ x .
And I and my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es c@@ ut into it , and we were able to determin@@ e , by looking at lin@@ es of ar@@ res@@ ted gro@@ w@@ th , some lin@@ es in it , that B@@ -@@ re@@ x had died at the age of 1@@ 6 .
We don &apos;t really know how long dinosaur@@ s li@@ ved , because we ha@@ ven &apos;t found the ol@@ des@@ t one yet .
But this one died at the age of 1@@ 6 .
We ga@@ ve sa@@ mp@@ les to Mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ we@@ it@@ z@@ er , and she was actually able to determin@@ e that B@@ -@@ re@@ x was a fe@@ mal@@ e based on me@@ d@@ ul@@ lar@@ y tis@@ su@@ e found on the inside of the b@@ one .
M@@ e@@ d@@ ul@@ lar@@ y tis@@ su@@ e is the cal@@ ci@@ um buil@@ d-@@ up , the cal@@ ci@@ um stor@@ age basi@@ cally , when an animal is pre@@ gn@@ ant , when a bir@@ d is pre@@ gn@@ ant .
So here was the char@@ ac@@ ter that lin@@ ked bir@@ ds and dinosaur@@ s .
But Mar@@ y went f@@ ur@@ ther .
She took the b@@ one , and she du@@ m@@ ped it into a@@ ci@@ d .
Now we all know that b@@ ones are fo@@ s@@ si@@ li@@ zed , and so if you du@@ m@@ p it into a@@ ci@@ d , there sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be anything left .
But there was something left .
There were blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s left .
There were f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , c@@ lear blood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s .
And so here was the first so@@ ft tis@@ su@@ e from a dinosa@@ u@@ r .
It was extraordin@@ ary .
But she also found o@@ ste@@ oc@@ y@@ tes , which are the cells that la@@ id down the b@@ ones .
And try and try , we could not find DNA , but she did find evi@@ den@@ ce of prote@@ ins .
But we thought maybe — well , we thought maybe that the material was bre@@ a@@ king down after it was coming out of the ground .
We thought maybe it was de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating very f@@ ast .
And so we buil@@ t a labor@@ at@@ ory in the back of an 1@@ 8@@ -@@ whe@@ el@@ er tra@@ il@@ er , and actually took the labor@@ at@@ ory to the fiel@@ d where we could get better sa@@ mp@@ les .
And we did . We got better material .
The cells looked better .
The v@@ es@@ sel@@ s looked better .
F@@ ound the prote@@ in col@@ la@@ gen .
I mean , it was wonderful stuff .
But it &apos;s not dinosa@@ u@@ r DNA .
So we have disco@@ vered that dinosa@@ u@@ r DNA , and all DNA , just bre@@ a@@ ks down too f@@ ast .
We &apos;re just not going to be able to do what they did in &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ ra@@ s@@ sic Par@@ k . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be able to make a dinosa@@ u@@ r based on a dinosa@@ u@@ r .
But bir@@ ds are dinosaur@@ s .
B@@ ir@@ ds are living dinosaur@@ s .
We actually cla@@ s@@ si@@ f@@ y them as dinosaur@@ s .
We now call them n@@ on-@@ avi@@ an dinosaur@@ s and avi@@ an dinosaur@@ s .
So the n@@ on-@@ avi@@ an dinosaur@@ s are the big cl@@ un@@ k@@ y ones that went ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t .
A@@ vi@@ an dinosaur@@ s are our moder@@ n bir@@ ds .
So we don &apos;t have to make a dinosa@@ u@@ r because we already have them .
( Laughter ) I know , you &apos;re as bad as the si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders . ( Laughter )
The si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders look at it and they say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You can call it a dinosa@@ u@@ r , but look at the velo@@ ci@@ rap@@ tor : the velo@@ ci@@ rap@@ tor is co@@ ol . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; The ch@@ ic@@ ken is not . &quot; ( Laughter )
So this is our problem , as you can imagine .
The ch@@ ic@@ ken is a dinosa@@ u@@ r .
I mean it really is .
You can &apos;t ar@@ gue with it because we &apos;re the cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ ers and we &apos;ve cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ ed it that way .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But the si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders de@@ m@@ and it .
&quot; F@@ i@@ x the ch@@ ic@@ ken . &quot;
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what I &apos;m here to tell you about : how we are going to fi@@ x a ch@@ ic@@ ken .
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fi@@ x the ch@@ ic@@ ken .
Because evolu@@ tion works , we actually have some evolu@@ tion@@ ary to@@ ols .
We &apos;ll call them bio@@ logical mo@@ di@@ fi@@ cation to@@ ols .
We have se@@ lec@@ tion .
And we know se@@ lec@@ tion works .
We started out with a w@@ ol@@ f-@@ like cre@@ ature and we en@@ ded up with a M@@ al@@ t@@ ese .
I mean , that &apos;s — that &apos;s defini@@ tely genetic mo@@ di@@ fi@@ cation .
O@@ r any of the other fun@@ n@@ y@@ -@@ looking little do@@ gs .
We also have trans@@ gen@@ esis .
T@@ ran@@ s@@ gen@@ esis is really co@@ ol too .
That &apos;s where you take a gene out of one animal and stic@@ k it in another one .
That &apos;s how people make G@@ lo@@ F@@ is@@ h .
You take a glo@@ w gene out of a coral or a j@@ el@@ l@@ y@@ fish and you stic@@ k it in a z@@ e@@ bra@@ fish , and , pu@@ ff , they glo@@ w .
And that &apos;s pretty co@@ ol .
And they obvi@@ ously make a lot of money off of them .
And now they &apos;re making G@@ low@@ -@@ ra@@ b@@ b@@ its and G@@ low@@ -@@ al@@ l@@ -@@ sor@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ things .
I gu@@ ess we could make a glo@@ w ch@@ ic@@ ken .
( Laughter ) But I don &apos;t think that &apos;ll sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y the si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders ei@@ ther .
But there &apos;s another thing .
There &apos;s what we call a@@ ta@@ vis@@ m activ@@ ation .
And a@@ ta@@ vis@@ m activ@@ ation is basi@@ cally — an a@@ ta@@ vis@@ m is an an@@ c@@ est@@ ral char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
You heard that oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally children are bor@@ n with ta@@ il@@ s , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s an an@@ c@@ est@@ ral char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
And so there are a number of a@@ ta@@ vis@@ ms that can happen .
S@@ na@@ kes are oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally bor@@ n with le@@ gs .
And here &apos;s an example .
This is a ch@@ ic@@ ken with te@@ e@@ th .
A fel@@ low by the name of M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ar@@ r@@ is at the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in in M@@ adi@@ son actually fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to sti@@ mu@@ late the gene for te@@ e@@ th , and so was able to actually turn the to@@ ot@@ h gene on and produ@@ ce te@@ e@@ th in ch@@ ick@@ ens .
Now that &apos;s a good char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
We can sa@@ ve that one .
We know we can use that .
We can make a ch@@ ic@@ ken with te@@ e@@ th .
That &apos;s getting clo@@ ser .
That &apos;s better than a glo@@ wing ch@@ ic@@ ken .
( Laughter ) A fri@@ end of min@@ e , a col@@ lea@@ gue of min@@ e , D@@ r. H@@ ans L@@ ar@@ s@@ son at M@@ c@@ G@@ ill Uni@@ versi@@ ty , is actually looking at a@@ ta@@ vis@@ ms .
And he &apos;s looking at them by looking at the em@@ br@@ y@@ o gen@@ esis of bir@@ ds and actually looking at how they develo@@ p , and he &apos;s interes@@ ted in how bir@@ ds actually lost their ta@@ il .
He &apos;s also interes@@ ted in the trans@@ forma@@ tion of the ar@@ m , the hand , to the wing .
He &apos;s looking for those genes as well .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you can find those , I can just re@@ ver@@ se them and make what I need to make for the si@@ x@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders . &quot; &quot; And so he ag@@ re@@ ed .
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking into .
If you look at dinosa@@ u@@ r han@@ ds , a velo@@ ci@@ rap@@ tor has that co@@ ol@@ -@@ looking hand with the cla@@ ws on it .
Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x , which is a bir@@ d , a pri@@ mi@@ tive bir@@ d , still has that very pri@@ mi@@ tive hand .
But as you can see , the pi@@ ge@@ on , or a ch@@ ic@@ ken or anything else , another bir@@ d , has kind of a we@@ ir@@ d-@@ looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
But the co@@ ol thing is that , if you look in the em@@ br@@ y@@ o , as the em@@ br@@ y@@ o is develo@@ ping the hand actually loo@@ ks pretty much like the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x hand .
It has the three f@@ ing@@ ers , the three di@@ g@@ its .
But a gene tur@@ ns on that actually f@@ us@@ es those together .
And so what we &apos;re looking for is that gene .
We want to stop that gene from tur@@ ning on , f@@ using those han@@ ds together , so we can get a ch@@ ic@@ ken that ha@@ t@@ ches out with a th@@ ree@@ -@@ f@@ ing@@ er@@ ed hand , like the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x .
And the same goes for the ta@@ il@@ s .
B@@ ir@@ ds have basi@@ cally ru@@ di@@ men@@ tar@@ y ta@@ il@@ s .
And so we know that in em@@ br@@ y@@ o , as the animal is develo@@ ping , it actually has a rela@@ tively long ta@@ il .
But a gene tur@@ ns on and res@@ or@@ b@@ s the ta@@ il , gets ri@@ d of it .
So that &apos;s the other gene we &apos;re looking for .
We want to stop that ta@@ il from res@@ or@@ b@@ ing .
So what we &apos;re trying to do really is take our ch@@ ic@@ ken , mo@@ dif@@ y it and make the ch@@ ick@@ en@@ osa@@ ur@@ us .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a co@@ ol@@ er@@ -@@ looking ch@@ ic@@ ken .
But it &apos;s just the very basi@@ cs .
So that really is what we &apos;re doing .
And people always say , &quot; &quot; Why do that ?
Why make this thing ?
What good is it ? &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a good question .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a great way to te@@ ach kids about evolu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy and develo@@ p@@ mental bio@@ logy and all sor@@ ts of things .
And quite f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , I think if C@@ ol@@ on@@ el S@@ an@@ ders was to be car@@ e@@ ful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se an ex@@ tra piece .
( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way — When our din@@ o@@ -@@ ch@@ ic@@ ken ha@@ t@@ ches , it will be , obvi@@ ously , the pos@@ ter child , or what you might call a pos@@ ter ch@@ ick , for technology , en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment and desig@@ n .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Vi@@ sion is the most important and pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed sense that we have .
We are con@@ stan@@ tly looking at the world around us , and qu@@ ick@@ ly we identi@@ f@@ y and make sense of what it is that we see .
Let &apos;s just start with an example of that very fact .
I &apos;m going to show you a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h of a person , just for a second or two , and I &apos;d like for you to identi@@ f@@ y what emo@@ tion is on his face .
Re@@ ad@@ y ?
Here you go . G@@ o with your gu@@ t reac@@ tion .
Okay . What did you see ?
Well , we actually sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed over 1@@ 20 individu@@ als , and the resul@@ ts were mi@@ x@@ ed .
People did not ag@@ ree on what emo@@ tion they saw on his face .
Ma@@ ybe you saw dis@@ com@@ for@@ t .
That was the most f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent respon@@ se that we rece@@ i@@ ved .
So we are all looking at the very same face again .
We might see something enti@@ re@@ ly different , because per@@ cep@@ tion is sub@@ jec@@ tive .
What we think we see is actually fil@@ ter@@ ed through our own mind &apos;s ey@@ e .
O@@ f course , there are many other examp@@ les of how we see the world through own mind &apos;s ey@@ e .
And actually , our poli@@ tical beli@@ ef@@ s also can af@@ fec@@ t the way we see other people , inclu@@ ding poli@@ tici@@ ans .
So my research te@@ am and I decided to test this question .
In 200@@ 8 , B@@ ar@@ ack O@@ ba@@ ma was run@@ ning for pres@@ id@@ ent for the very first time , and we sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed hundre@@ ds of Amer@@ ic@@ ans one mon@@ th before the elec@@ tion .
O@@ f these people , 7@@ 5 percent vo@@ ted for O@@ ba@@ ma in the actual elec@@ tion .
So how is that possible ?
How could it be that when I look at a person , an ob@@ ject , or an ev@@ ent , I see something very different than somebody else does ?
Well , the reas@@ ons are many , but one reason re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work .
S@@ imi@@ lar problems are emer@@ ging in the E@@ ast as well .
E@@ ach of you pos@@ s@@ es@@ ses the most power@@ ful , dan@@ ger@@ ous and sub@@ versi@@ ve tra@@ it that natural se@@ lec@@ tion has ever devi@@ sed .
It &apos;s a piece of neu@@ ral audi@@ o technology for re@@ w@@ ir@@ ing other people &apos;s min@@ ds .
I &apos;m talking about your language , of course , because it al@@ lo@@ ws you to imp@@ l@@ ant a thought from your mind direc@@ tly into someone else &apos;s mind , and they can at@@ temp@@ t to do the same to you , without ei@@ ther of you having to per@@ form sur@@ ger@@ y .
In@@ stead , when you spe@@ ak , you &apos;re actually using a form of tele@@ me@@ try not so different from the re@@ m@@ ote control devi@@ ce for your tele@@ vi@@ sion .
It &apos;s just that , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as that devi@@ ce reli@@ es on pul@@ ses of inf@@ r@@ ar@@ ed light , your language reli@@ es on pul@@ ses , dis@@ cre@@ te pul@@ ses , of sound .
And just as you use the re@@ m@@ ote control devi@@ ce to al@@ ter the inter@@ n@@ al se@@ tt@@ ings of your tele@@ vi@@ sion to su@@ it your mo@@ od , you use your language to al@@ ter the se@@ tt@@ ings inside someone else &apos;s brain to su@@ it your inter@@ est@@ s .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ ages are genes talking , getting things that they want .
And just imagine the sense of won@@ der in a bab@@ y when it first disco@@ ver@@ s that , mer@@ e@@ ly by u@@ tter@@ ing a sound , it can get ob@@ jects to move across a room as if by ma@@ gi@@ c , and maybe even into its m@@ outh .
Now language &apos;s sub@@ versi@@ ve power has been recogni@@ zed throu@@ gh@@ out the ages in cen@@ sor@@ ship , in bo@@ o@@ ks you can &apos;t read , ph@@ ra@@ ses you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
In fact , the To@@ wer of B@@ a@@ bel story in the B@@ i@@ ble is a f@@ able and war@@ ning about the power of language .
A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to that story , early human@@ s developed the con@@ ce@@ it that , by using their language to work together , they could build a to@@ wer that would take them all the way to he@@ a@@ ven .
Now God , an@@ ger@@ ed at this at@@ temp@@ t to us@@ ur@@ p his power , dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed the to@@ wer , and then to en@@ sure that it would never be re@@ buil@@ t , he s@@ ca@@ tter@@ ed the people by gi@@ ving them different langu@@ ages — con@@ fu@@ sed them by gi@@ ving them different langu@@ ages .
And this le@@ ads to the wonderful i@@ ron@@ y that our langu@@ ages exis@@ t to pre@@ v@@ ent us from communi@@ ca@@ ting .
E@@ ven today , we know that there are words we cannot use , ph@@ ra@@ ses we cannot say , because if we do so , we might be ac@@ co@@ s@@ ted , j@@ ai@@ led , or even k@@ il@@ led .
And all of this from a pu@@ ff of air e@@ man@@ ating from our m@@ ou@@ ths .
Now all this f@@ us@@ s about a single one of our tra@@ its te@@ lls us there &apos;s something wor@@ th ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing .
And that is how and why did this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able tra@@ it e@@ vol@@ ve , and why did it e@@ vol@@ ve only in our species ?
Now it &apos;s a little bit of a sur@@ pri@@ se that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to to@@ ol use in the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es .
Now these ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es are using to@@ ols , and we take that as a si@@ g@@ n of their inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce .
But if they really were inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent , why would they use a stic@@ k to extra@@ c@@ t ter@@ mi@@ tes from the ground ra@@ ther than a sho@@ vel ?
And if they really were inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent , why would they cra@@ ck open nu@@ ts with a ro@@ ck ?
Why w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t they just go to a sho@@ p and bu@@ y a ba@@ g of nu@@ ts that somebody else had already cra@@ c@@ ked open for them ?
Why not ? I mean , that &apos;s what we do .
Now the reason the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es don &apos;t do that is that they lack what p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts and an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts call social learning .
They see@@ m to lack the ability to learn from others by co@@ p@@ ying or imi@@ ta@@ ting or simply wat@@ ching .
As a resul@@ t , they can &apos;t impro@@ ve on others &apos; ideas or learn from others &apos; mi@@ sta@@ kes — ben@@ ef@@ it from others &apos; wis@@ dom .
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again .
In fact , we could go away for a million years and come back and these ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es would be doing the same thing with the same stic@@ ks for the ter@@ mi@@ tes and the same ro@@ c@@ ks to cra@@ ck open the nu@@ ts .
Now this may sound ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant , or even full of hu@@ br@@ is .
How do we know this ?
Because this is exactly what our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , the Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s , did .
These u@@ pri@@ ght ap@@ es e@@ vol@@ ved on the A@@ fri@@ can sa@@ van@@ na about two million years ago , and they made these s@@ pl@@ en@@ did hand ax@@ es that f@@ it wonder@@ ful@@ ly into your han@@ ds .
But if we look at the fo@@ s@@ si@@ l recor@@ d , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years .
You can fol@@ low it through the fo@@ s@@ si@@ l recor@@ d .
Now if we make some gu@@ es@@ ses about how long Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s li@@ ved , what their gener@@ ation time was , that &apos;s about 4@@ 0@@ ,000 gener@@ ations of parents to of@@ f@@ s@@ pr@@ ing , and other individu@@ als wat@@ ching , in which that hand axe didn &apos;t change .
It &apos;s not even c@@ lear that our very clo@@ se genetic rela@@ tiv@@ es , the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , had social learning .
S@@ ure enough , their to@@ ols were more comp@@ lica@@ ted than those of Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s , but they too sho@@ w@@ ed very little change over the 3@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 years or so that those species , the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , li@@ ved in E@@ u@@ ra@@ si@@ a .
Okay , so what this te@@ lls us is that , con@@ tr@@ ary to the old ada@@ ge , &quot; mon@@ k@@ ey see , mon@@ k@@ ey do , &quot; the sur@@ pri@@ se really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that — at le@@ ast not very much .
And even this picture has the s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous ta@@ int of being ri@@ gg@@ ed about it — something from a B@@ ar@@ nu@@ m &@@ amp@@ ; B@@ ai@@ le@@ y cir@@ c@@ us .
But by compar@@ is@@ on , we can learn .
We can learn by wat@@ ching other people and co@@ p@@ ying or imi@@ ta@@ ting what they can do .
We can then cho@@ ose , from a@@ mon@@ g a ran@@ ge of op@@ tions , the best one .
We can ben@@ ef@@ it from others &apos; ideas .
We can build on their wis@@ dom .
And as a resul@@ t , our ideas do ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late , and our technology pro@@ g@@ res@@ ses .
And this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cul@@ tural ada@@ p@@ tation , as an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts call this ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas , is respon@@ sible for everything around you in your bu@@ st@@ ling and te@@ em@@ ing every@@ day lives .
I mean the world has chan@@ ged out of all pro@@ por@@ tion to what we would recogni@@ ze even 1@@ ,000 or 2@@ ,000 years ago .
And all of this because of cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cul@@ tural ada@@ p@@ tation .
The cha@@ ir@@ s you &apos;re si@@ tting in , the li@@ ghts in this audi@@ tori@@ um , my micro@@ ph@@ one , the i@@ P@@ ads and i@@ Po@@ ds that you car@@ ry around with you — all are a resul@@ t of cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cul@@ tural ada@@ p@@ tation .
Now to many com@@ men@@ ta@@ tors , cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cul@@ tural ada@@ p@@ tation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
Ou@@ r species can make stuff , ther@@ e@@ fore we pro@@ s@@ per@@ ed in a way that no other species has .
In fact , we can even make the &quot; &quot; stuff of life &quot; &quot; — as I just said , all the stuff around us .
But in fact , it tur@@ ns out that some time around 200@@ ,000 years ago , when our species first ar@@ ose and ac@@ qui@@ red social learning , that this was really the beg@@ in@@ ning of our story , not the end of our story .
Because our ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion of social learning would create a social and evolu@@ tion@@ ary di@@ le@@ m@@ ma , the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of which , it &apos;s fa@@ ir to say , would determin@@ e not only the future course of our p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy , but the future course of the entire world .
And most import@@ an@@ tly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
And the reason that di@@ le@@ m@@ ma ar@@ ose is , it tur@@ ns out , that social learning is visual the@@ ft .
If I can learn by wat@@ ching you , I can ste@@ al your best ideas , and I can ben@@ ef@@ it from your ef@@ for@@ ts , without having to put in the time and energy that you did into develo@@ ping them .
If I can wat@@ ch which l@@ ure you use to ca@@ t@@ ch a fish , or I can wat@@ ch how you f@@ la@@ ke your hand axe to make it better , or if I fol@@ low you se@@ cre@@ tly to your m@@ us@@ h@@ room pa@@ t@@ ch , I can ben@@ ef@@ it from your kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and wis@@ dom and s@@ ki@@ lls , and maybe even ca@@ t@@ ch that fish before you do .
So@@ cial learning really is visual the@@ ft .
And in any species that ac@@ qui@@ red it , it would be@@ ho@@ o@@ ve you to hi@@ de your best ideas , l@@ est somebody ste@@ al them from you .
And so some time around 200@@ ,000 years ago , our species con@@ fron@@ ted this cri@@ sis .
And we really had only two op@@ tions for de@@ al@@ ing with the con@@ fli@@ c@@ ts that visual the@@ ft would br@@ ing .
One of those op@@ tions was that we could have re@@ tre@@ ated into small family g@@ rou@@ ps .
Because then the ben@@ ef@@ its of our ideas and kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge would f@@ low just to our rela@@ tiv@@ es .
H@@ ad we cho@@ sen this op@@ tion , some@@ time around 200@@ ,000 years ago , we would probably still be living like the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als were when we first en@@ ter@@ ed Europe 4@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago .
And this is because in small g@@ rou@@ ps there are fe@@ wer ideas , there are fe@@ wer in@@ no@@ va@@ tions .
And small g@@ rou@@ ps are more pro@@ ne to ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents and bad l@@ uc@@ k .
So if we &apos;d cho@@ sen that pa@@ th , our evolu@@ tion@@ ary pa@@ th would have led into the for@@ est — and been a sh@@ or@@ t one in@@ de@@ ed .
The other op@@ tion we could cho@@ ose was to develo@@ p the syste@@ ms of communi@@ cation that would al@@ low us to share ideas and to co@@ oper@@ ate a@@ mon@@ g@@ st others .
C@@ ho@@ o@@ sing this op@@ tion would mean that a va@@ st@@ ly gre@@ ater f@@ und of ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ la@@ ted kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and wis@@ dom would become a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to any one individu@@ al than would ever ari@@ se from within an individu@@ al family or an individu@@ al person on their own .
Well , we ch@@ ose the second op@@ tion , and language is the resul@@ t .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age e@@ vol@@ ved to sol@@ ve the cri@@ sis of visual the@@ ft .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age is a piece of social technology for en@@ han@@ c@@ ing the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation — for re@@ ach@@ ing ag@@ ree@@ ments , for stri@@ king de@@ als and for co@@ ordin@@ ating our activi@@ ties .
And you can see that , in a develo@@ ping socie@@ ty that was beg@@ in@@ ning to ac@@ qui@@ re language , not having language would be a like a bir@@ d without w@@ ings .
J@@ ust as w@@ ings open up this s@@ ph@@ ere of air for bir@@ ds to ex@@ p@@ lo@@ it , language op@@ en@@ ed up the s@@ ph@@ ere of co@@ oper@@ ation for human@@ s to ex@@ p@@ lo@@ it .
And we take this u@@ tter@@ ly for gran@@ ted , because we &apos;re a species that is so at home with language , but you have to realiz@@ e that even the simp@@ l@@ est ac@@ ts of ex@@ change that we eng@@ age in are u@@ tter@@ ly depen@@ d@@ ent u@@ po@@ n language .
And to see why , consi@@ der two s@@ cen@@ arios from early in our evolu@@ tion .
Let &apos;s imagine that you are really good at making ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads , but you &apos;re ho@@ pe@@ less at making the w@@ oo@@ den s@@ ha@@ f@@ ts with the f@@ light fe@@ a@@ thers at@@ ta@@ ched .
T@@ w@@ o other people you know are very good at making the w@@ oo@@ den s@@ ha@@ f@@ ts , but they &apos;re ho@@ pe@@ less at making the ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads .
So what you do is — one of those people has not really ac@@ qui@@ red language yet .
And let &apos;s pre@@ ten@@ d the other one is good at language s@@ ki@@ lls .
So what you do one day is you take a pi@@ le of ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads , and you wal@@ k up to the one that can &apos;t spe@@ ak very well , and you put the ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads down in front of him , ho@@ ping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to tra@@ de your ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads for fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed ar@@ ro@@ ws .
But he loo@@ ks at the pi@@ le of ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads , thin@@ ks they &apos;re a gi@@ ft , pic@@ ks them up , s@@ miles and wal@@ ks off .
Now you pur@@ su@@ e this guy , g@@ es@@ tic@@ u@@ la@@ ting .
A s@@ cu@@ f@@ f@@ le en@@ su@@ es and you get sta@@ b@@ bed with one of your own ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads .
Okay , now re@@ play this s@@ cen@@ e now , and you &apos;re appro@@ ach@@ ing the one who has language .
You put down your ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads and say , &quot; I &apos;d like to tra@@ de these ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads for fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed ar@@ ro@@ ws . I &apos;ll sp@@ li@@ t you 50 / 50 . &quot;
The other one says , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine . L@@ oo@@ ks good to me .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot; &quot; Now the job is done .
O@@ n@@ ce we have language , we can put our ideas together and co@@ oper@@ ate to have a pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity that we coul@@ dn &apos;t have before we ac@@ qui@@ red it .
And this is why our species has pro@@ s@@ per@@ ed around the world while the res@@ t of the animals si@@ t be@@ hind bar@@ s in z@@ o@@ os , langu@@ is@@ hing .
That &apos;s why we build space s@@ hu@@ tt@@ les and ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als while the res@@ t of the world stic@@ ks stic@@ ks into the ground to extra@@ c@@ t ter@@ mi@@ tes .
All right , if this vie@@ w of language and its valu@@ e in sol@@ ving the cri@@ sis of visual the@@ ft is true , any species that ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ es it should show an ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of crea@@ tivi@@ ty and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
And this is exactly what the ar@@ che@@ o@@ logical recor@@ d sho@@ ws .
If you look at our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als and the Ho@@ mo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s , our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , they &apos;re con@@ fin@@ ed to small re@@ gi@@ ons of the world .
But when our species ar@@ ose about 200@@ ,000 years ago , some@@ time after that we qu@@ ick@@ ly wal@@ ked out of Africa and s@@ pre@@ ad around the entire world , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ying ne@@ ar@@ ly every hab@@ it@@ at on Earth .
Now wh@@ er@@ e@@ as other species are con@@ fin@@ ed to places that their genes ada@@ pt them to , with social learning and language , we could trans@@ form the environment to su@@ it our nee@@ ds .
And so we pro@@ s@@ per@@ ed in a way that no other animal has .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age really is the most po@@ t@@ ent tra@@ it that has ever e@@ vol@@ ved .
It is the most valu@@ able tra@@ it we have for conver@@ ting new lan@@ ds and res@@ our@@ ces into more people and their genes that natural se@@ lec@@ tion has ever devi@@ sed .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age really is the vo@@ ice of our genes .
Now having e@@ vol@@ ved language , though , we did something pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , even bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re .
As we s@@ pre@@ ad out around the world , we developed thousands of different langu@@ ages .
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently , there are about se@@ ven or 8@@ ,000 different langu@@ ages s@@ po@@ ken on Earth .
Now you might say , well , this is just natural .
As we diver@@ ge , our langu@@ ages are n@@ atur@@ ally going to diver@@ ge .
But the real pu@@ z@@ z@@ le and i@@ ron@@ y is that the gre@@ at@@ est den@@ si@@ ty of different langu@@ ages on Earth is found where people are most ti@@ gh@@ tly p@@ ac@@ ked together .
If we go to the is@@ land of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Ne@@ w Gu@@ in@@ e@@ a , we can find about 8@@ 00 to 1@@ ,000 dist@@ inc@@ t human langu@@ ages , different human langu@@ ages , s@@ po@@ ken on that is@@ land al@@ one .
There are places on that is@@ land where you can en@@ coun@@ ter a new language every two or three miles .
Now , incre@@ di@@ ble as this so@@ unds , I on@@ ce me@@ t a P@@ a@@ pu@@ an man , and I asked him if this could pos@@ si@@ bly be true .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far clo@@ ser together than that . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true ; there are places on that is@@ land where you can en@@ coun@@ ter a new language in under a mi@@ le .
And this is also true of some re@@ m@@ ote oce@@ ani@@ c is@@ lan@@ ds .
And so it see@@ ms that we use our language , not just to co@@ oper@@ ate , but to dra@@ w r@@ ings around our co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive g@@ rou@@ ps and to esta@@ bli@@ sh identi@@ ties , and per@@ haps to protec@@ t our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and wis@@ dom and s@@ ki@@ lls from e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p@@ ping from out@@ side .
And we know this because when we study different language g@@ rou@@ ps and as@@ soci@@ ate them with their cul@@ tures , we see that different langu@@ ages s@@ low the f@@ low of ideas between g@@ rou@@ ps .
They s@@ low the f@@ low of technolo@@ gi@@ es .
And they even s@@ low the f@@ low of genes .
Now I can &apos;t spe@@ ak for you , but it see@@ ms to be the case that we don &apos;t have se@@ x with people we can &apos;t talk to .
( Laughter ) Now we have to coun@@ ter that , though , aga@@ in@@ st the evi@@ den@@ ce we &apos;ve heard that we might have had some ra@@ ther di@@ sta@@ ste@@ ful genetic d@@ al@@ li@@ an@@ ces with the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als and the D@@ en@@ i@@ so@@ v@@ ans . ( Laughter )
Okay , this ten@@ den@@ cy we have , this se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly natural ten@@ den@@ cy we have , to@@ war@@ ds i@@ so@@ lation , to@@ war@@ ds ke@@ e@@ ping to ourselves , cra@@ sh@@ es head first into our moder@@ n world .
This re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ima@@ ge is not a ma@@ p of the world .
In fact , it &apos;s a ma@@ p of F@@ ace@@ book fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship lin@@ ks .
And when you p@@ lot those fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship lin@@ ks by their la@@ ti@@ tu@@ de and lon@@ g@@ it@@ u@@ de , it liter@@ ally dra@@ ws a ma@@ p of the world .
Ou@@ r moder@@ n world is communi@@ ca@@ ting with it@@ self and with each other more than it has at any time in its pa@@ st .
And that communi@@ cation , that connec@@ tivi@@ ty around the world , that glob@@ aliz@@ ation now ra@@ is@@ es a bur@@ den .
Because these different langu@@ ages im@@ pos@@ e a bar@@ ri@@ er , as we &apos;ve just seen , to the trans@@ fer of go@@ o@@ ds and ideas and technolo@@ gi@@ es and wis@@ dom .
And they im@@ pos@@ e a bar@@ ri@@ er to co@@ oper@@ ation .
And no@@ where do we see that more c@@ lear@@ ly than in the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , wh@@ ose 2@@ 7 member countries spe@@ ak 2@@ 3 of@@ fici@@ al langu@@ ages .
The Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on is now s@@ pen@@ ding over one billion e@@ ur@@ os an@@ nu@@ ally trans@@ la@@ ting a@@ mon@@ g their 2@@ 3 of@@ fici@@ al langu@@ ages .
That &apos;s something on the order of 1@@ .@@ 4@@ 5 billion U.@@ S@@ . dollars on trans@@ lation co@@ sts al@@ one .
Now think of the ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ty of this situ@@ ation .
If 2@@ 7 individu@@ als from those 2@@ 7 member sta@@ tes s@@ at around table , spe@@ a@@ king their 2@@ 3 langu@@ ages , some very simple ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics will tell you that you need an ar@@ my of 2@@ 5@@ 3 trans@@ la@@ tors to anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the pa@@ ir@@ wi@@ se pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ties .
The Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on emp@@ lo@@ ys a per@@ man@@ ent sta@@ ff of about 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 trans@@ la@@ tors .
And in 200@@ 7 al@@ one — and I &apos;m sure there are more rec@@ ent figur@@ es — something on the order of 1@@ .@@ 3 million pa@@ ges were trans@@ la@@ ted into English al@@ one .
And so if language really is the solu@@ tion to the cri@@ sis of visual the@@ ft , if language really is the condu@@ it of our co@@ oper@@ ation , the technology that our species der@@ i@@ ved to pro@@ m@@ ote the f@@ ree f@@ low and ex@@ change of ideas , in our moder@@ n world , we con@@ front a question .
And that question is whether in this moder@@ n , glob@@ aliz@@ ed world we can really af@@ for@@ d to have all these different langu@@ ages .
To put it this way , n@@ ature kno@@ ws no other cir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance in which func@@ tion@@ ally equi@@ val@@ ent tra@@ its co@@ exis@@ t .
One of them always dri@@ ves the other ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t .
And we see this in the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able mar@@ ch to@@ war@@ ds stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation .
There are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of ways of meas@@ ur@@ ing things — we@@ i@@ gh@@ ing them and meas@@ ur@@ ing their l@@ eng@@ th — but the me@@ tri@@ c system is win@@ ning .
There are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of ways of meas@@ ur@@ ing time , but a really bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re base 60 system kno@@ wn as h@@ our@@ s and minu@@ tes and secon@@ ds is ne@@ ar@@ ly univer@@ sa@@ l around the world .
There are many , many ways of imp@@ r@@ in@@ ting C@@ D@@ s or D@@ V@@ D@@ s , but those are all being stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed as well .
And you can probably think of many , many more in your own every@@ day lives .
And so our moder@@ n world now is con@@ fron@@ ting us with a di@@ le@@ m@@ ma .
And it &apos;s the di@@ le@@ m@@ ma that this Ch@@ in@@ ese man fac@@ es , who &apos;s language is s@@ po@@ ken by more people in the world than any other single language , and yet he is si@@ tting at his b@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ bo@@ ard , conver@@ ting Ch@@ in@@ ese ph@@ ra@@ ses into English language ph@@ ra@@ ses .
And what this does is it ra@@ is@@ es the pos@@ si@@ bility to us that in a world in which we want to pro@@ m@@ ote co@@ oper@@ ation and ex@@ change , and in a world that might be depen@@ d@@ ent more than ever before on co@@ oper@@ ation to ma@@ in@@ tain and en@@ h@@ ance our lev@@ els of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , his ac@@ tions su@@ gg@@ est to us it might be in@@ evi@@ table that we have to con@@ front the idea that our dest@@ in@@ y is to be one world with one language .
Thank you .
( Applause ) M@@ at@@ t R@@ id@@ le@@ y : Mar@@ k , one question .
S@@ v@@ ante found that the FOX@@ P@@ 2 gene , which see@@ ms to be as@@ soci@@ ated with language , was also shar@@ ed in the same form in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als as us .
D@@ o we have any idea how we could have de@@ fe@@ ated Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als if they also had language ?
Mar@@ k P@@ ag@@ el : This is a very good question .
So many of you will be famili@@ ar with the idea that there &apos;s this gene called FOX@@ P@@ 2 that see@@ ms to be imp@@ lica@@ ted in some ways in the fin@@ e mot@@ or control that &apos;s as@@ soci@@ ated with language .
The reason why I don &apos;t believe that te@@ lls us that the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als had language is — here &apos;s a simple anal@@ o@@ gy : F@@ er@@ r@@ ar@@ is are car@@ s that have eng@@ in@@ es .
My car has an eng@@ ine , but it &apos;s not a F@@ er@@ r@@ ar@@ i .
Now the simple answer then is that genes al@@ one don &apos;t , all by themselves , determin@@ e the out@@ come of very comp@@ lica@@ ted things like language .
What we know about this FOX@@ P@@ 2 and Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als is that they may have had fin@@ e mot@@ or control of their m@@ ou@@ ths — who kno@@ ws .
But that doesn &apos;t tell us they neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly had language .
M@@ R : Thank you very much in@@ de@@ ed .
( Applause )
Let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce to you Re@@ z@@ ero .
This little fel@@ low was developed by a gro@@ up of 10 under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ents at the Au@@ ton@@ o@@ mous S@@ y@@ ste@@ ms L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory at E@@ T@@ H@@ -@@ Z@@ u@@ ri@@ ch .
Ou@@ r ro@@ bo@@ t be@@ lon@@ gs to a family of ro@@ bot@@ s called B@@ al@@ l@@ bot@@ s .
In@@ stead of whe@@ els , a B@@ al@@ l@@ bo@@ t is bal@@ an@@ c@@ ing and mo@@ ving on one single b@@ all .
The ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of such a system is that there &apos;s one so@@ le con@@ tac@@ t point to the ground .
This means that the ro@@ bo@@ t is in@@ her@@ ently un@@ sta@@ ble .
It &apos;s like when I am trying to st@@ and on one fo@@ o@@ t .
You might ask yourself , what &apos;s the u@@ se@@ ful@@ ness of a ro@@ bo@@ t that &apos;s un@@ sta@@ ble ?
Now we &apos;ll ex@@ pla@@ in that in a second .
Let me first ex@@ pla@@ in how Re@@ z@@ ero actually ke@@ e@@ ps his bal@@ ance .
Re@@ z@@ ero ke@@ e@@ ps his bal@@ ance by con@@ stan@@ tly meas@@ ur@@ ing his p@@ it@@ ch an@@ g@@ le with a sen@@ s@@ or .
He then coun@@ ter@@ ac@@ ts and a@@ vo@@ i@@ ds to@@ p@@ pl@@ ing over by tur@@ ning the mot@@ ors appro@@ pri@@ ately .
This happens 1@@ 60 times per second , and if anything fa@@ il@@ s in this process , Re@@ z@@ ero would im@@ medi@@ ately f@@ all to the ground .
Now to move and to bal@@ ance , Re@@ z@@ ero nee@@ ds to turn the b@@ all .
The b@@ all is dri@@ ven by three spe@@ cial whe@@ els that al@@ low Re@@ z@@ ero to move into any direc@@ tion and also move around his own ax@@ is at the same time .
D@@ u@@ e to his in@@ sta@@ bility , Re@@ z@@ ero is always in mo@@ tion . Now here &apos;s the tri@@ ck .
It &apos;s in@@ de@@ ed exactly this in@@ sta@@ bility that al@@ lo@@ ws a ro@@ bo@@ t to move very &#91; dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cally &#93; .
Let &apos;s play a little .
You may have wonder@@ ed what happens if I give the ro@@ bo@@ t a little p@@ us@@ h .
In this mo@@ de , he &apos;s trying to ma@@ in@@ tain his posi@@ tion .
For the next de@@ mo , I &apos;d like you to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce to my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el , on the computer , and Th@@ o@@ mas who &apos;s hel@@ ping me on@@ sta@@ ge .
In the next mo@@ de , Re@@ z@@ ero is pas@@ sive , and we can move him around .
W@@ ith almost no for@@ ce I can control his posi@@ tion and his velo@@ city .
I can also make him sp@@ in .
In the next mo@@ de , we can get Re@@ z@@ ero to fol@@ low a person .
He &apos;s now ke@@ e@@ ping a con@@ st@@ ant dist@@ ance to Th@@ o@@ mas .
This works with a la@@ ser sen@@ s@@ or that &apos;s moun@@ ted on top of Re@@ z@@ ero .
W@@ ith the same me@@ th@@ od , we can also get him to cir@@ cle a person .
We call this the or@@ b@@ it@@ ing mo@@ de .
All right , th@@ ank you , Th@@ o@@ mas .
( Applause ) Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
For now , it &apos;s an experi@@ ment , but let me show you some possible future ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions .
Re@@ z@@ ero could be used in ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions or par@@ ks .
W@@ ith a s@@ cre@@ en it could in@@ form people or show them around in a f@@ un and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing way .
In a hospital , this devi@@ ce could be used to car@@ ry around medical equi@@ p@@ ment .
D@@ u@@ e to the B@@ al@@ l@@ bo@@ t system , it has a very small fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and it &apos;s also e@@ as@@ y to move around .
And of course , who w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t like to take a ri@@ de on one of these .
And these are more prac@@ tical ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions .
But there &apos;s also a cer@@ tain be@@ au@@ ty within this technology .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you .
So let me ask for a show of han@@ ds .
How many people here are over the age of 4@@ 8 ?
Well , con@@ gra@@ tu@@ la@@ tions , because if you look at this particular sli@@ de of U.@@ S@@ . life expec@@ tan@@ cy , you are now in ex@@ cess of the a@@ ver@@ age life sp@@ an of somebody who was bor@@ n in 19@@ 00 .
But look what happened in the course of that cent@@ ur@@ y .
If you fol@@ low that cur@@ ve , you &apos;ll see that it star@@ ts way down there .
There &apos;s that di@@ p there for the 19@@ 1@@ 8 fl@@ u .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
But there &apos;s still a lot of work to do .
So , for inst@@ ance , if you ask , how many dise@@ ases do we now know the exac@@ t mole@@ cular bas@@ is ?
Tur@@ ns out it &apos;s about 4@@ ,000 , which is pretty amazing , because most of those mole@@ cular disco@@ ver@@ ies have just happened in the last little while .
It &apos;s exci@@ ting to see that in ter@@ ms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4@@ ,000 dise@@ ases now have tre@@ at@@ ments a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble ?
O@@ n@@ ly about 2@@ 50 .
You would think this w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be too hard , that we would simply have the ability to take this funda@@ mental information that we &apos;re learning about how it is that ba@@ sic bio@@ logy teach@@ es us about the caus@@ es of disease and build a bri@@ dge across this y@@ aw@@ ning ga@@ p between what we &apos;ve learned about ba@@ sic science and its ap@@ pli@@ cation , a bri@@ dge that would look maybe something like this , where you &apos;d have to put together a n@@ ice sh@@ in@@ y way to get from one side to the other .
Well , w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be n@@ ice if it was that e@@ as@@ y ?
In re@@ ality , trying to go from funda@@ mental kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge to its ap@@ pli@@ cation is more like this .
There are no sh@@ in@@ y bri@@ d@@ ges .
You sort of place your be@@ ts .
Well , what does this really look like ?
Well , what is it to make a ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic , any@@ way ?
What &apos;s a drug ? A drug is made up of a small mole@@ cu@@ le of hy@@ dro@@ gen , car@@ b@@ on , o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen , and a few other ato@@ ms all co@@ b@@ b@@ led together in a s@@ hap@@ e , and it &apos;s those s@@ hap@@ es that determin@@ e whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to h@@ it its tar@@ get .
I@@ s it going to land where it &apos;s sup@@ pos@@ ed to ?
So look at this picture here — a lot of s@@ hap@@ es dan@@ c@@ ing around for you .
You we@@ ed down through vari@@ ous ste@@ ps that cause many of these to fa@@ il .
U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , maybe you can r@@ un a c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ al with four or five of these , and if all goes well , 1@@ 4 years after you started , you will get one appro@@ v@@ al .
And it will co@@ st you u@@ p@@ war@@ ds of a billion dollars for that one suc@@ cess .
How can we make this go fas@@ ter ?
How can we make it more suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful ?
Well , let me tell you about a few examp@@ les where this has actually worked .
One that has just happened in the last few months is the suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful appro@@ v@@ al of a drug for cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis .
But it &apos;s ta@@ ken a long time to get there .
That picture you see there ?
Here it is . That &apos;s the same kid .
That &apos;s D@@ an@@ ny B@@ es@@ se@@ t@@ te , 2@@ 3 years later , because this is the year , and it &apos;s also the year where D@@ an@@ ny got mar@@ ri@@ ed , where we have , for the first time , the appro@@ v@@ al by the F@@ D@@ A of a drug that preci@@ se@@ ly tar@@ gets the de@@ fec@@ t in cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis based u@@ po@@ n all this mole@@ cular underst@@ an@@ ding .
That &apos;s the good news .
The bad news is , this drug doesn &apos;t actually tre@@ at all ca@@ ses of cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis , and it w@@ on &apos;t work for D@@ an@@ ny , and we &apos;re still wa@@ it@@ ing for that next gener@@ ation to help him .
But it took 2@@ 3 years to get this far . That &apos;s too long .
fal@@ l@@ en fas@@ ter than Mo@@ ore &apos;s L@@ a@@ w , down to the point where it is less than 10@@ ,000 dollars today to have your gen@@ o@@ me se@@ quen@@ ced , or min@@ e , and we &apos;re he@@ a@@ ded for the $ 1@@ ,000 gen@@ o@@ me fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on .
Well , that &apos;s exci@@ ting .
How does that play out in ter@@ ms of ap@@ pli@@ cation to a disease ?
I want to tell you about another dis@@ order .
This one is a dis@@ order which is quite r@@ are .
It &apos;s called H@@ u@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ son@@ -@@ G@@ il@@ for@@ d pro@@ ger@@ ia , and it is the most dra@@ ma@@ tic form of pre@@ ma@@ ture aging .
O@@ n@@ ly about one in every four million kids has this disease , and in a simple way , what happens is , because of a mu@@ tation in a particular gene , a prote@@ in is made that &apos;s to@@ xi@@ c to the cell and it caus@@ es these individu@@ als to age at about se@@ ven times the normal rate .
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell .
A pro@@ ger@@ ia cell , on the other hand , because of this to@@ xi@@ c prote@@ in called pro@@ ger@@ in , has these lu@@ mp@@ s and bu@@ mp@@ s in it .
So what we would like to do after disco@@ ver@@ ing this back in 200@@ 3 is to come up with a way to try to correc@@ t that .
Well again , by kno@@ wing something about the mole@@ cular path@@ ways , it was possible to pic@@ k one of those many , many com@@ po@@ unds that might have been u@@ se@@ ful and try it out .
In an experi@@ ment done in cell culture and sho@@ wn here in a carto@@ on , if you take that particular com@@ po@@ und and you ad@@ d it to that cell that has pro@@ ger@@ ia , and you wat@@ ch to see what happened , in just 7@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s , that cell be@@ comes , for all pur@@ pos@@ es that we can determin@@ e , almost like a normal cell .
Well that was exci@@ ting , but would it actually work in a real human being ?
This has led , in the space of only four years from the time the gene was disco@@ vered to the start of a c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ al , to a test of that very com@@ po@@ und .
And the kids that you see here all vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to be part of this , 2@@ 8 of them , and you can see as so@@ on as the picture comes up that they are in fact a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able gro@@ up of young people all af@@ fli@@ c@@ ted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other .
And instead of telling you more about it , I &apos;m going to invi@@ te one of them , S@@ am B@@ er@@ ns from Bo@@ st@@ on , who &apos;s here this mor@@ ning , to come up on the sta@@ ge and tell us about his experience as a child af@@ fec@@ ted with pro@@ ger@@ ia .
S@@ am is 15 years old . H@@ is parents , S@@ co@@ t@@ t B@@ er@@ ns and L@@ es@@ li@@ e G@@ or@@ don , both physi@@ ci@@ ans , are here with us this mor@@ ning as well .
S@@ am , ple@@ ase have a se@@ at .
( Applause ) So S@@ am , why don &apos;t you tell these fol@@ ks what it &apos;s like being af@@ fec@@ ted with this condi@@ tion called pro@@ ger@@ ia ?
S@@ am B@@ ur@@ ns : Well , pro@@ ger@@ ia limi@@ ts me in some ways .
I cannot play s@@ por@@ ts or do physical activi@@ ties , but I have been able to take inter@@ est in things that pro@@ ger@@ ia , l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , does not limi@@ t .
( Applause ) Fran@@ c@@ is C@@ ol@@ lin@@ s : So what would you like to say to resear@@ ch@@ ers here in the audi@@ tori@@ um and others listen@@ ing to this ?
What would you say to them both about research on pro@@ ger@@ ia and maybe about other condi@@ tions as well ?
S@@ B : Well , research on pro@@ ger@@ ia has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just sho@@ ws the dri@@ ve that resear@@ ch@@ ers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with pro@@ ger@@ ia , and it sho@@ ws that if that dri@@ ve exist@@ s , any@@ body can cur@@ e any disease , and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly pro@@ ger@@ ia can be cu@@ red in the ne@@ ar future , and so we can eli@@ min@@ ate those 4@@ ,000 dise@@ ases that Fran@@ c@@ is was talking about .
P@@ le@@ ase jo@@ in me in th@@ an@@ king and w@@ el@@ coming S@@ am .
S@@ B : Thank you very much . F@@ C : Well done . Well done , bu@@ d@@ dy .
( Applause ) So I just want to say a cou@@ ple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ aliz@@ e how could we have stories of suc@@ cess all over the place for these dise@@ ases , as S@@ am says , these 4@@ ,000 that are wa@@ it@@ ing for ans@@ w@@ ers .
You might have no@@ tic@@ ed that the drug that is now in c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ al for pro@@ ger@@ ia is not a drug that was desig@@ ned for that .
This is a drug that was developed for cancer .
Tur@@ ned out , it didn &apos;t work very well for cancer , but it has exactly the right pro@@ per@@ ties , the right s@@ hap@@ e , to work for pro@@ ger@@ ia , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
W@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be great if we could do that more syste@@ ma@@ tically ?
That could be a ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al , valu@@ able activi@@ ty .
There are quite a number of suc@@ cess stories one can point to about how this has led to ma@@ j@@ or ad@@ van@@ ces .
The first drug for H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S was not developed for H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
It was developed for cancer . It was A@@ Z@@ T .
It didn &apos;t work very well for cancer , but became the first suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral , and you can see from the table there are others as well .
So how do we actually make that a more gener@@ aliz@@ able ef@@ for@@ t ?
Well , we have to come up with a par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship between aca@@ de@@ mi@@ a , government , the priva@@ te sec@@ tor , and pati@@ ent organi@@ z@@ ations to make that so .
It just started last D@@ ec@@ e@@ mber , and this is one of its go@@ als .
How do we know , for inst@@ ance , whether drugs are sa@@ fe before we give them to people ? We test them on animals .
And it &apos;s not all that reli@@ able , and it &apos;s co@@ st@@ ly , and it &apos;s ti@@ me@@ -@@ consu@@ ming .
Su@@ p@@ pos@@ e we could do this instead on human cells .
You probably know , if you &apos;ve been pa@@ ying attention to some of the science liter@@ ature that you can now take a sk@@ in cell and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it to become a li@@ ver cell or a heart cell or a ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y cell or a brain cell for any of us .
So what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it &apos;s going to be sa@@ fe ?
Here you see a picture of a l@@ un@@ g on a chi@@ p .
This is something cre@@ ated by the W@@ y@@ ss In@@ stitu@@ te in Bo@@ st@@ on , and what they have done here , if we can r@@ un the little video , is to take cells from an individu@@ al , turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the l@@ un@@ g , and determin@@ e what would happen if you ad@@ ded to this vari@@ ous drug com@@ po@@ unds to see if they are to@@ xi@@ c or sa@@ fe .
You can see this chi@@ p even bre@@ a@@ th@@ es .
It has an air chan@@ ne@@ l . It has a blood chan@@ ne@@ l .
A@@ re those cells happ@@ y or not ?
You can do this same kind of chi@@ p technology for ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys , for hear@@ ts , for m@@ us@@ c@@ les , all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem , for the li@@ ver .
And ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , because you can do this for the individu@@ al , we could even see this mo@@ ving to the point where the ability to develo@@ p and test medi@@ cin@@ es will be you on a chi@@ p , what we &apos;re trying to say here is the individu@@ aliz@@ ing of the process of develo@@ ping drugs and t@@ esting their sa@@ fe@@ ty .
So let me su@@ m up .
We are in a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able moment here .
We have made all these disco@@ ver@@ ies po@@ ur@@ ing out of laboratori@@ es across the world .
What do we need to cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ e on this ? F@@ ir@@ st of all , we need res@@ our@@ ces .
This is research that &apos;s high@@ -@@ ris@@ k , sometimes high@@ -@@ co@@ st .
The pa@@ y@@ off is enor@@ mous , both in ter@@ ms of health and in ter@@ ms of econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th . We need to sup@@ port that .
And th@@ ird , and maybe most important , we need tal@@ ent .
We need the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test from many different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ es to come and jo@@ in this ef@@ for@@ t — all ages , all different g@@ rou@@ ps — because this is the time , fol@@ ks .
I hope that &apos;s your go@@ al .
I think it &apos;ll be the go@@ al of the poe@@ ts and the mu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts and the sur@@ fer@@ s and the ban@@ kers and all the other people who jo@@ in this sta@@ ge and think about what we &apos;re trying to do here and why it ma@@ t@@ ters .
It ma@@ t@@ ters for now . It ma@@ t@@ ters as so@@ on as possible .
If you don &apos;t believe me , just ask S@@ am .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
D@@ o you remember the story of O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus and the S@@ ir@@ ens from high school or j@@ uni@@ or high school ?
There was this h@@ ero , O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus , who &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ing back home after the T@@ ro@@ j@@ an W@@ ar .
And he &apos;s stan@@ ding on the de@@ ck of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first mate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; To@@ mor@@ row , we will sa@@ il pa@@ st those ro@@ c@@ ks , and on those ro@@ c@@ ks si@@ t some beautiful wo@@ men called S@@ ir@@ ens .
And these wo@@ men sing an en@@ chan@@ ting son@@ g , a son@@ g so al@@ l@@ ur@@ ing that all sa@@ il@@ ors who he@@ ar it cra@@ sh into the ro@@ c@@ ks and di@@ e . &quot; &quot; Now you would expec@@ t , given that , that they would cho@@ ose an alter@@ na@@ te rou@@ te around the S@@ ir@@ ens , but instead O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus says , &quot; &quot; I want to he@@ ar that son@@ g .
And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to po@@ u@@ r wa@@ x in the ear@@ s of you and all the men — sta@@ y with me — so that you can &apos;t he@@ ar the son@@ g , and then I &apos;m going to have you ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st so that I can li@@ ste@@ n and we can all sa@@ il by un@@ af@@ fec@@ ted . &quot; &quot; So this is a cap@@ tain pu@@ tting the life of every single person on the ship at ris@@ k so that he can he@@ ar a son@@ g .
And I &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have re@@ hear@@ sed it a few times .
O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus would have said , &quot; &quot; Okay , let &apos;s do a dr@@ y r@@ un .
You ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st , and I &apos;m going to be@@ g and ple@@ ad .
And no matter what I say , you cannot un@@ ti@@ e me from the ma@@ st .
All right , so ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st . &quot; &quot; And the first mate takes a ro@@ pe and ties O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus to the ma@@ st in a n@@ ice k@@ not .
And O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus does his best job play@@ ac@@ ting and says , &quot; &quot; Un@@ ti@@ e me . Un@@ ti@@ e me .
I want to he@@ ar that son@@ g . Un@@ ti@@ e me . &quot; &quot; And the first mate wi@@ se@@ ly resist@@ s and doesn &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus .
And then O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus says , &quot; &quot; I see that you can get it .
All right , un@@ ti@@ e me now and we &apos;ll get some din@@ ner . &quot; &quot; And the first mate h@@ esi@@ ta@@ tes .
He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this still the re@@ hear@@ sa@@ l , or should I un@@ ti@@ e him ? &quot; &quot; And the first mate thin@@ ks , &quot; Well , I gu@@ ess at some point the re@@ hear@@ sa@@ l has to end . &quot;
So he un@@ ties O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus , and O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus fli@@ ps out .
He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You i@@ di@@ o@@ t . You mor@@ on .
If you do that to@@ mor@@ row , I &apos;ll be de@@ ad , you &apos;ll be de@@ ad , every single one of the men will be de@@ ad .
Now just don &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e me no matter what . &quot; &quot; He th@@ ro@@ ws the first mate to the ground .
This re@@ pe@@ at@@ s it@@ self through the ni@@ ght — re@@ hear@@ sa@@ l , t@@ ying to the ma@@ st , con@@ ning his way out of it , be@@ ating the po@@ or first mate up mer@@ ci@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly .
H@@ il@@ ar@@ ity en@@ su@@ es .
T@@ ying yourself to a ma@@ st is per@@ haps the ol@@ des@@ t wri@@ t@@ ten example of what p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts call a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ce .
A com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ce is a deci@@ sion that you make with a co@@ ol head to bin@@ d yourself so that you don &apos;t do something re@@ gre@@ t@@ table when you have a ho@@ t head .
Because there &apos;s two he@@ ads inside one person when you think about it .
S@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s have long in@@ vo@@ ked this meta@@ ph@@ or of two selves when it comes to ques@@ tions of temp@@ tation .
There is first , the present self .
This is like O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus when he &apos;s hear@@ ing the son@@ g .
He just wan@@ ts to get to the front row .
He just thin@@ ks about the here and now and the im@@ medi@@ ate gra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation .
But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self .
This is O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus as an old man who wan@@ ts nothing more than to re@@ ti@@ re in a s@@ un@@ ny vi@@ ll@@ a with his wi@@ fe Pen@@ e@@ lo@@ pe out@@ side of I@@ th@@ ac@@ a — the other one .
So why do we need com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces ?
Well resist@@ ing temp@@ tation is hard , as the 19@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y English econo@@ mi@@ st N@@ as@@ sa@@ u W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ en@@ i@@ or said , &quot; &quot; To ab@@ sta@@ in from the en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment which is in our power , or to see@@ k dist@@ ant ra@@ ther than im@@ medi@@ ate resul@@ ts , are a@@ mon@@ g the most pa@@ in@@ ful exer@@ tions of the human will . &quot; &quot; If you set go@@ als for yourself and you &apos;re like a lot of other people , you probably realiz@@ e it &apos;s not that your go@@ als are physi@@ cally im@@ possible that &apos;s ke@@ e@@ ping you from ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ving them , it &apos;s that you lack the sel@@ f-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine to stic@@ k to them .
It &apos;s physi@@ cally possible to lo@@ se we@@ ight .
It &apos;s physi@@ cally possible to exer@@ ci@@ se more .
But resist@@ ing temp@@ tation is hard .
The other reason that it &apos;s dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to res@@ ist temp@@ tation is because it &apos;s an un@@ equ@@ al bat@@ t@@ le between the present self and the future self .
I mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present .
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
It has these st@@ rong , her@@ o@@ ic ar@@ ms that can li@@ ft dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts into your m@@ outh .
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s we@@ ak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a la@@ w@@ y@@ er present .
There &apos;s no@@ body to stic@@ k up for the future self .
And so the present self can tro@@ un@@ ce all over its dre@@ a@@ ms .
So there &apos;s this bat@@ t@@ le between the two selves that &apos;s being f@@ ou@@ ght , and we need com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces to level the pla@@ ying fiel@@ d between the two .
Now I &apos;m a big fan of com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces actually .
T@@ ying yourself to the ma@@ st is the ol@@ des@@ t one , but there are other ones such as lo@@ c@@ king a cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d away with a k@@ ey or not br@@ ing@@ ing j@@ un@@ k food into the house so you w@@ on &apos;t eat it or un@@ p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ing your Internet connec@@ tion so you can use your computer .
I was cre@@ ating com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces of my own long before I knew what they were .
So when I was a star@@ ving pos@@ t@@ -@@ do@@ c at C@@ ol@@ u@@ mbi@@ a Uni@@ versi@@ ty , I was de@@ ep in a publi@@ sh@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ per@@ is@@ h p@@ ha@@ se of my car@@ e@@ er .
I had to wri@@ te five pa@@ ges a day to@@ war@@ ds pa@@ per@@ s or I would have to give up five dollars .
And when you try to ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te these com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces , you realiz@@ e the devi@@ l is really in the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
Because it &apos;s not that e@@ as@@ y to get ri@@ d of five dollars .
I mean , you can &apos;t bur@@ n it ; that &apos;s il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
And I thought , well I could give it to a char@@ ity or give it to my wi@@ fe or something like that .
But then I thought , oh , I &apos;m sen@@ ding myself mi@@ x@@ ed mes@@ sa@@ ges .
Because not wri@@ ting is bad , but gi@@ ving to char@@ ity is good .
So then I would kind of j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y not wri@@ ting by gi@@ ving a gi@@ ft .
And then I kind of fli@@ p@@ ped that around and thought , well I could give it to the ne@@ o@@ -@@ Na@@ z@@ is .
But then I was like , that &apos;s more bad than wri@@ ting is good , and so that w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t work .
So ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , I just decided I would lea@@ ve it in an en@@ velo@@ pe on the sub@@ way .
So@@ me@@ times a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
O@@ n a@@ ver@@ age , it was just a comple@@ tely po@@ in@@ t@@ less ex@@ change of money that I would re@@ gre@@ t .
( Laughter ) S@@ uch it is with com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces .
But des@@ pi@@ te my like for them , there &apos;s two n@@ ag@@ ging con@@ cer@@ ns that I &apos;ve always had about com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
So the first is , when you &apos;ve got one of these devi@@ ces going , such as this contra@@ c@@ t to wri@@ te every@@ day or pa@@ y , it &apos;s just a con@@ st@@ ant re@@ min@@ der that you have no sel@@ f-@@ control .
You &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out you , com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ce , I am nothing , I have no sel@@ f-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; And then when you &apos;re ever in a situ@@ ation where you don &apos;t have a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ce in place — like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , that person &apos;s of@@ fer@@ ing me a dou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut , and I have no defen@@ se me@@ chan@@ ism , &quot; &quot; — you just eat it .
So I don &apos;t like the way that they take the power away from you .
I think sel@@ f-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine is something , it &apos;s like a m@@ us@@ cle .
The more you exer@@ ci@@ se it , the st@@ ron@@ ger it gets .
The other problem with com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces is that you can always we@@ a@@ se@@ l your way out of them .
You say , &quot; &quot; Well , of course I can &apos;t wri@@ te today , because I &apos;m gi@@ ving a TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ k and I have five media inter@@ vie@@ ws , and then I &apos;m going to a co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and then I &apos;ll be dr@@ un@@ k after that .
And so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot; &quot; So in effec@@ t , you are like O@@ dy@@ s@@ seus and the first mate in one person .
You &apos;re pu@@ tting yourself , you &apos;re bin@@ ding yourself , and you &apos;re we@@ a@@ sel@@ ing your way out of it , and then you &apos;re be@@ ating yourself up af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds .
So I &apos;ve been working for about a deca@@ de now on fin@@ ding other ways to change people &apos;s rela@@ tion@@ ship to the future self without using com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment devi@@ ces .
In particular , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in the rela@@ tion@@ ship to the future finan@@ cial self .
And this is a ti@@ me@@ ly is@@ su@@ e .
I &apos;m talking about the to@@ pi@@ c of sa@@ ving .
Now sa@@ ving is a cla@@ s@@ sic two selves problem .
The present self does not want to sa@@ ve at all .
It wan@@ ts to consu@@ me .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the future self wan@@ ts the present self to sa@@ ve .
So this is a ti@@ me@@ ly problem .
We look at the sa@@ v@@ ings rate and it has been de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing sin@@ ce the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
A@@ t the same time , the Re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment Ris@@ k In@@ de@@ x , the chan@@ ce of not being able to me@@ et your nee@@ ds in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , has been incre@@ as@@ ing .
And we &apos;re at a situ@@ ation now where for every three bab@@ y bo@@ o@@ m@@ ers , the M@@ c@@ K@@ in@@ se@@ y G@@ lo@@ b@@ al In@@ stitu@@ te pre@@ dic@@ ts that two will not be able to me@@ et their pre@@ -@@ re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment nee@@ ds while they &apos;re in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
So what can we do about this ?
There &apos;s a phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er , D@@ er@@ e@@ k Par@@ f@@ it , who said some words that were in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing to my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I@@ .
He said that , &quot; &quot; We might ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t our future selves because of some fa@@ il@@ ure of belie@@ f or imag@@ in@@ ation . &quot; &quot; That is to say , we some@@ how might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day .
O@@ n the one hand , it so@@ unds ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
O@@ f course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old .
But ar@@ en &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
So my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I have used compu@@ ters , the gre@@ at@@ est to@@ ol of our time , to as@@ si@@ st people &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
And I &apos;ll show you some of these to@@ ols right here .
The first is called the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der .
It sho@@ ws people what the future might be like by sho@@ wing them a hundre@@ d equ@@ ally prob@@ able out@@ comes that might be ob@@ tain@@ ed in the future .
E@@ ach out@@ come is sho@@ wn by one of these mar@@ kers , and each si@@ ts on a row that repres@@ ents a level of we@@ al@@ th and re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
Be@@ ing up at the top means that you &apos;re en@@ jo@@ ying a high in@@ come in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
Be@@ ing down at the bot@@ to@@ m means that you &apos;re stru@@ gg@@ ling to make ends me@@ et .
When you make an inv@@ est@@ ment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; I ac@@ cep@@ t that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determin@@ e my we@@ al@@ th . &quot; &quot; Now you can try to move your out@@ comes around .
You can try to man@@ i@@ pu@@ late your fa@@ te , like this person is doing , but it co@@ sts you something to do it .
It means that you have to sa@@ ve more today .
O@@ n@@ ce you find an inv@@ est@@ ment that you &apos;re happ@@ y with , what people do is they cli@@ ck &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; and the mar@@ kers beg@@ in to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar , s@@ low@@ ly , one by one .
It si@@ mu@@ la@@ tes what it is like to inv@@ est in something and to wat@@ ch that inv@@ est@@ ment p@@ an out .
A@@ t the end , there will only be one mar@@ ker left stan@@ ding and it will determin@@ e our we@@ al@@ th in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
Y@@ es , this person re@@ ti@@ red at 1@@ 50 percent of their working in@@ come in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
They &apos;re making more money while re@@ ti@@ red than they were making while they were working .
If you &apos;re like most people , just see@@ ing that ga@@ ve you a small sense of e@@ lation and jo@@ y — just to think about making 50 percent more money in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment than before .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , had you en@@ ded up on the very bot@@ to@@ m , it might have given you a s@@ light sense of dre@@ ad and / or n@@ au@@ sea thinking about stru@@ gg@@ ling to get by in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
B@@ y using this to@@ ol over and over and si@@ mu@@ la@@ ting out@@ come after out@@ come , people can understand that the inv@@ est@@ ments and sa@@ v@@ ings that they under@@ take today determin@@ e their w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being in the future .
Now people are mo@@ tiv@@ ated through emo@@ tions , but different people find different things mo@@ tiv@@ ating .
This is a si@@ mu@@ lation that us@@ es gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s , but other people find mo@@ tiv@@ ating what money can bu@@ y , not just nu@@ mb@@ ers .
So here I made a dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der where instead of sho@@ wing nu@@ mer@@ i@@ cal out@@ comes , I show people what those out@@ comes will get you , in particular apar@@ t@@ ments that you can af@@ for@@ d if you &apos;re re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing on 3@@ ,000 , 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 , 2@@ ,000 dollars per mon@@ th and so on .
As you move down the la@@ d@@ der of apar@@ t@@ ments , you see that they get wor@@ se and wor@@ se .
So@@ me of them look like places I li@@ ved in as a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
And as you get to the very bot@@ to@@ m , you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate re@@ ality that if you don &apos;t sa@@ ve anything for re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , you w@@ on &apos;t be able to af@@ for@@ d any h@@ ou@@ sing at all .
Th@@ ose are actual pic@@ tures of actual apar@@ t@@ ments r@@ ent@@ ing for that amount as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sed on the Internet .
The last thing I &apos;ll show you , the last behavi@@ or@@ al time mach@@ ine , is something that I cre@@ ated with H@@ al H@@ er@@ sh@@ fiel@@ d , who was in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to me by my co@@ au@@ th@@ or on a pre@@ vi@@ ous project , B@@ ill S@@ har@@ pe .
And what it is is an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation into virtual re@@ ality .
So what we do is we take pic@@ tures of people — in this case , colle@@ ge@@ -@@ age people — and we use sof@@ tw@@ are to age them and show these people what they &apos;ll look like when they &apos;re 60 , 70 , 80 years old .
And we try to test whether actually as@@ si@@ st@@ ing your imag@@ in@@ ation by looking at the face of your future self can change you inv@@ est@@ ment behavi@@ or .
So this is one of our experi@@ ments .
Here we see the face of the young sub@@ ject on the left .
He &apos;s given a control that al@@ lo@@ ws him to ad@@ just his sa@@ v@@ ings rate .
As he mo@@ ves his sa@@ v@@ ings rate down , it means that he &apos;s sa@@ ving z@@ ero when it &apos;s all the way here at the left .
You can see his cur@@ r@@ ent an@@ nu@@ al in@@ come — this is the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of his pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k that he can take home today — is quite high , 9@@ 1 percent , but his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment in@@ come is quite low .
He &apos;s going to re@@ ti@@ re on 4@@ 4 percent of what he ear@@ ned while he was working .
If he sa@@ ves the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um le@@ g@@ al amount , his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment in@@ come goes up , but he &apos;s un@@ happ@@ y because now he has less money on the le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side to s@@ pen@@ d today .
O@@ ther condi@@ tions show people the future self .
And from the future self &apos;s point of vie@@ w , everything is in re@@ ver@@ se .
If you sa@@ ve very little , the future self is un@@ happ@@ y living on 4@@ 4 percent of the in@@ come .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as if the present self sa@@ ves a lot , the future self is de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted , where the in@@ come is clo@@ se up ne@@ ar 100 percent .
To br@@ ing this to a wi@@ der audi@@ ence , I &apos;ve been working with H@@ al and A@@ lli@@ an@@ z to create something we call the behavi@@ or@@ al time mach@@ ine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted emo@@ tional reac@@ tions to different lev@@ els of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment we@@ al@@ th .
So for inst@@ ance , here is somebody using the to@@ ol .
And just wat@@ ch the fa@@ cial expres@@ si@@ ons as they move the sli@@ der .
The youn@@ ger face gets hap@@ pi@@ er and hap@@ pi@@ er , sa@@ ving nothing .
The ol@@ der face is mi@@ ser@@ able .
And s@@ low@@ ly , s@@ low@@ ly we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing it up to a moder@@ ate sa@@ v@@ ings rate .
And then it &apos;s a high sa@@ v@@ ings rate .
The youn@@ ger face is getting un@@ happ@@ y .
The ol@@ der face is quite p@@ lea@@ sed with the deci@@ sion .
We &apos;re going to see if this has an effec@@ t on what people do .
And what &apos;s n@@ ice about it is it &apos;s not something that bi@@ as@@ ing people actually , because as one face s@@ miles , the other face fro@@ w@@ ns .
It &apos;s not telling you which way to put the sli@@ der , it &apos;s just re@@ min@@ ding you that you are connec@@ ted to and le@@ g@@ ally ti@@ ed to this future self .
Y@@ our deci@@ si@@ ons today are going to determin@@ e its w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to for@@ get .
This use of virtual re@@ ality is not just good for making people look ol@@ der .
There are progra@@ ms you can get to see how people might look if they s@@ mo@@ ke , if they get too much ex@@ pos@@ ure to the s@@ un , if they ga@@ in we@@ ight and so on .
And what &apos;s good is , un@@ like in the experi@@ ments that H@@ al and myself ran with R@@ us@@ s S@@ mi@@ th , you don &apos;t have to progra@@ m these by yourself in order to see the virtual re@@ ality .
There are ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions you can get on s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
This is actually a picture of H@@ al , my co@@ au@@ th@@ or .
You might recogni@@ ze him from the pre@@ vi@@ ous demos .
And just for k@@ ic@@ ks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and we@@ ight ga@@ in sof@@ tw@@ are to see how he would look .
H@@ al is here , so I think we o@@ we it to him as well as yourself to di@@ sab@@ use you of that last ima@@ ge .
And I &apos;ll clo@@ se it there .
O@@ n be@@ half of H@@ al and myself , I wis@@ h all the best to your present and future selves .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The rec@@ ent de@@ ba@@ te over co@@ p@@ y@@ right la@@ ws like S@@ O@@ P@@ A in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes and the A@@ C@@ T@@ A ag@@ ree@@ ment in Europe has been very emo@@ tional .
And I think some dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate , qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive reas@@ on@@ ing could really br@@ ing a great de@@ al to the de@@ ba@@ te .
For inst@@ ance , just rec@@ ently the Mo@@ tion P@@ ic@@ ture As@@ soci@@ ation re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that our econo@@ my lo@@ ses 5@@ 8 billion dollars a year to co@@ p@@ y@@ right the@@ ft .
Now ra@@ ther than just ar@@ gue about this number , a co@@ p@@ y@@ right ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ an will anal@@ y@@ ze it and he &apos;ll so@@ on disco@@ ver that this money could stre@@ t@@ ch from this audi@@ tori@@ um all the way across O@@ ce@@ an B@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard to the W@@ esti@@ n , and then to Mar@@ s ...
( Laughter ) ... if we use pen@@ ni@@ es .
Now this is obvi@@ ously a power@@ ful , some might say dan@@ ger@@ ously power@@ ful , in@@ si@@ ght .
But it &apos;s also a mor@@ ally important one .
Because this isn &apos;t just the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical re@@ ta@@ il valu@@ e of some pira@@ ted mo@@ vi@@ es that we &apos;re talking about , but this is actual econo@@ mic lo@@ s@@ ses .
This is the equi@@ val@@ ent to the entire Ameri@@ can cor@@ n cro@@ p fa@@ il@@ ing al@@ ong with all of our f@@ ru@@ it cro@@ ps , as well as whe@@ at , to@@ bac@@ co , ri@@ ce , sor@@ gh@@ um — w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver sor@@ gh@@ um is — lo@@ sing sor@@ gh@@ um .
So that &apos;s a ch@@ un@@ k of what we &apos;re looking for .
But tot@@ al mo@@ vi@@ e re@@ ven@@ u@@ es across the@@ a@@ ters , home video and pa@@ y@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ vie@@ w are up .
And T@@ V , sa@@ te@@ lli@@ te and ca@@ ble re@@ ven@@ u@@ es are way up .
So this small mis@@ sing ch@@ un@@ k here is pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) S@@ in@@ ce the big cont@@ ent mar@@ ke@@ ts have gro@@ wn in line with histori@@ c nor@@ ms , it &apos;s not ad@@ di@@ tional gro@@ w@@ th that pi@@ rac@@ y has pre@@ ven@@ ted , but co@@ p@@ y@@ right ma@@ th te@@ lls us it must ther@@ e@@ fore be fo@@ re@@ g@@ one gro@@ w@@ th in a mar@@ ket that has no histori@@ c nor@@ ms — one that didn &apos;t exis@@ t in the 90 &apos;s .
What we &apos;re looking at here is the in@@ si@@ di@@ ous co@@ st of r@@ ing@@ t@@ one pi@@ rac@@ y .
O@@ ther data has the music indu@@ stry at about 4@@ 5@@ ,000 people .
And this is just one of the many min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing sta@@ ti@@ stics that co@@ p@@ y@@ right ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ ans have to de@@ al with every day .
It &apos;s the preci@@ se amount of har@@ m that comes to media comp@@ ani@@ es wh@@ en@@ ever a single co@@ p@@ y@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted son@@ g or mo@@ vi@@ e gets pira@@ ted .
Now when this la@@ w first pas@@ sed , the world &apos;s h@@ ot@@ test M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er could h@@ old just 10 son@@ gs .
And it was a big Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ mas h@@ it .
Because what little ho@@ o@@ d@@ lu@@ m w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t want a million and a half b@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of st@@ ol@@ en go@@ o@@ ds in his po@@ c@@ ket .
I want to talk to you about my kids .
Because what I see in them is myself — or what would have been myself .
A@@ t five years old , I thought everyone had a life just like min@@ e .
A@@ t five years old , I thought everyone was just like me .
These are things my kids don &apos;t get .
Why doesn &apos;t everyone get this ?
Why is a high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality education only ex@@ c@@ lu@@ sive to the ri@@ ch ?
It was like I had some sort of sur@@ viv@@ or &apos;s re@@ mor@@ se .
I think we &apos;ve got it all wrong .
A@@ n over@@ simp@@ li@@ fi@@ cation of Ameri@@ can edu@@ ca@@ tional hist@@ ory .
B@@ l@@ ac@@ ks were ke@@ pt out — you know , the whole s@@ la@@ very thing .
For years , I tri@@ ed des@@ per@@ ately to cul@@ tiv@@ ate in my kids a love of read@@ ing .
And then they &apos;d say , almost s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ously , &quot; But they &apos;re br@@ an@@ d-@@ new . &quot;
Re@@ ally ?
Un@@ til then , there &apos;s no democra@@ cy in our democra@@ tic education .
What is a car@@ pen@@ ter with no to@@ ols ?
What is an ac@@ tr@@ ess with no sta@@ ge ?
What is a scienti@@ st with no labor@@ at@@ ory ?
What is a doc@@ tor with no equi@@ p@@ ment ?
I &apos;ll tell you : they &apos;re my kids .
S@@ h@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t they be your kids , too ?
I &apos;m a brain scienti@@ st , and as a brain scienti@@ st , I &apos;m actually interes@@ ted in how the brain lear@@ ns , and I &apos;m especi@@ ally interes@@ ted in a pos@@ si@@ bility of making our bra@@ ins s@@ mar@@ ter , better and fas@@ ter .
This is in this con@@ text I &apos;m going to tell you about video games . When we say video games , most of you think about children .
It &apos;s true . N@@ in@@ e@@ ty percent of children do play video games .
But let &apos;s be f@@ ran@@ k .
When the kids are in bed , who is in front of the P@@ la@@ y@@ S@@ tation ?
So what we are as@@ king in the lab is , how can we le@@ ver@@ age that power ?
( S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing no@@ is@@ es ) The name of the game is to get after your en@@ e@@ my z@@ o@@ mbi@@ e bad gu@@ ys before they get to you , right ?
Mo@@ st parents would find that great .
Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you that pla@@ ying video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
It &apos;s not , and b@@ ing@@ ing is never good .
And so I &apos;m going to take a few examp@@ les from our work .
One first saying that I &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much s@@ cre@@ en time makes your ey@@ esi@@ ght wor@@ se .
Gu@@ ess what ? Th@@ e@@ ir vi@@ sion is really , really good .
It &apos;s better than those that don &apos;t play .
And it &apos;s better in two different ways .
A@@ no@@ ther saying that I &apos;m sure you have all heard around : V@@ ide@@ o games le@@ ad to attention problems and gre@@ ater dist@@ rac@@ ta@@ bility .
Okay , we know how to meas@@ ure attention in the lab .
I &apos;m actually going to give you an example of how we do so .
R@@ ight ? So this is the first example .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ard &quot; &quot; &#93; Au@@ di@@ ence : Re@@ d@@ .@@ D@@ a@@ ph@@ ne B@@ a@@ ve@@ li@@ er : R@@ ed .
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ or@@ se &quot; &quot; &#93; D@@ B : Y@@ el@@ low . Au@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ el@@ low .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Y@@ el@@ low &quot; &quot; &#93; D@@ B : R@@ ed . Au@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ el@@ low .
&#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ lue &quot; &quot; &#93; D@@ B : Y@@ el@@ low .
You &apos;re also ke@@ e@@ ping tra@@ ck of the pe@@ dest@@ ri@@ an , the run@@ ning do@@ g , and that &apos;s how you can actually be sa@@ fe dri@@ ving , right ?
But a few kids are sa@@ d and blue because they &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten their co@@ at .
W@@ as it y@@ el@@ low ini@@ ti@@ ally or blue ?
Y@@ el@@ low or blue ?
Au@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ el@@ low@@ .@@ D@@ B : G@@ o@@ od .
So your ty@@ pi@@ cal normal young adul@@ t can have a sp@@ an of about three or four ob@@ jects of attention .
That &apos;s what we just did . Y@@ our ac@@ tion video game play@@ er has a sp@@ an of about six to se@@ ven ob@@ jects of attention , which is what is sho@@ wn in this video here .
That &apos;s for you gu@@ ys , ac@@ tion video game play@@ ers .
Now , we can meas@@ ure that kind of s@@ ki@@ lls in the lab .
When we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of ac@@ tion games are really , really good .
They s@@ w@@ it@@ ch really f@@ ast , very s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly . They pa@@ y a very small co@@ st .
That &apos;s a multi@@ medi@@ a@@ -@@ ta@@ sk@@ er .
There was a first study done by col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d and that we re@@ pli@@ ca@@ ted that sho@@ w@@ ed that those people that identi@@ f@@ y as being high multi@@ medi@@ a@@ -@@ ta@@ sk@@ ers are absolu@@ tely ab@@ y@@ s@@ mal at multi@@ tas@@ king .
When we meas@@ ure them in the lab , they &apos;re really bad .
R@@ ight ? So these kinds of resul@@ ts really makes two ma@@ in po@@ in@@ ts .
The first one is that not all media are cre@@ ated equ@@ al .
The other l@@ es@@ son is that gener@@ al wis@@ dom car@@ ri@@ es no we@@ ight .
That &apos;s another ar@@ gu@@ ment for why we need to ste@@ p into the lab and really meas@@ ure the impac@@ t of technology on the brain .
I &apos;m much more interes@@ ted in taking any of you and sho@@ wing that by for@@ c@@ ing you to play an ac@@ tion game , I can actually change your vi@@ sion for the better , whether you want to play that ac@@ tion game or not , right ?
That &apos;s the point of re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation or education .
Mo@@ st of the kids don &apos;t go to school saying , &quot; Gre@@ at , two h@@ our@@ s of ma@@ th ! &quot;
So that &apos;s really the cru@@ x of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more ste@@ p .
And one more ste@@ p is to do tra@@ in@@ ing stu@@ dies .
M@@ en@@ tal r@@ ot@@ ation is a tas@@ k where I &apos;m going to ask you , and again you &apos;re going to do the tas@@ k , to look at this s@@ hap@@ e . S@@ tu@@ dy it , it &apos;s a tar@@ get s@@ hap@@ e , and I &apos;m going to present to you four different s@@ hap@@ es .
Okay , I &apos;ll help you . F@@ our@@ th one .
One more . G@@ et those bra@@ ins working . Co@@ me on .
That &apos;s our tar@@ get s@@ hap@@ e .
Th@@ ird . G@@ o@@ od ! This is hard , right ?
It doesn &apos;t really feel like pla@@ ying min@@ d@@ less ac@@ tion video games .
They don &apos;t play 10 h@@ our@@ s of ac@@ tion games in a row .
They do dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted prac@@ tice , so little sh@@ ots of 40 minu@@ tes se@@ ver@@ al days over a peri@@ od of two wee@@ ks .
Well , we &apos;re working on it , but here is a ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge .
That &apos;s the cho@@ co@@ late side of the equ@@ ation .
Wh@@ o really wan@@ ts to eat cho@@ co@@ la@@ te@@ -@@ co@@ vered bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ?
And I would like to ex@@ pla@@ in to you not only why it &apos;s time to change this , but also how we can do it .
As you would read a car ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine before pur@@ cha@@ sing a new car or taking a look at a produc@@ t re@@ vie@@ w before deci@@ ding which kind of ta@@ b@@ let or ph@@ one to get , inv@@ est@@ ors are read@@ ing ra@@ t@@ ings before they deci@@ de in which kind of produc@@ t they are inv@@ esting their money .
A ra@@ ting can ran@@ ge from a so@@ -@@ called A@@ A@@ A , which means it &apos;s a to@@ p@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ ming produc@@ t , and it can go down to the level of the so@@ -@@ called B@@ B@@ B@@ - , which means it &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly ris@@ k@@ y inv@@ est@@ ment .
R@@ ating ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es are ra@@ ting comp@@ ani@@ es .
They are ra@@ ting ban@@ ks .
They are ra@@ ting even finan@@ cial produc@@ ts like the in@@ fa@@ mous mor@@ t@@ g@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ bac@@ ked se@@ curi@@ ties .
And I can tell , as you &apos;re listen@@ ing to me right now , you &apos;re thinking , so why should I really care about this , right ?
B@@ e hon@@ est .
Well , ra@@ t@@ ings af@@ fec@@ t you .
They af@@ fec@@ t all of us .
If a ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy ra@@ tes a country , it basi@@ cally as@@ s@@ es@@ ses and e@@ valu@@ ates a country &apos;s de@@ b@@ t and the ability and wi@@ ll@@ ing@@ ness of a country to re@@ pa@@ y its de@@ b@@ t .
So it af@@ fec@@ ts you as a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en and as a ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ er , because you and your fel@@ low coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men have to pon@@ y up more in order to bor@@ row .
But what if a country can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to pa@@ y more because it &apos;s maybe too ex@@ pen@@ sive ?
Well , then the country has less a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble for other ser@@ vi@@ ces , like ro@@ ads , s@@ cho@@ ols , health@@ care .
And this is the reason why you should care , because so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ra@@ t@@ ings af@@ fec@@ t everyone .
And that is the reason why I believe they should be defin@@ ed as publi@@ c go@@ o@@ ds .
They should be trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ ces@@ sible , and a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble to everyone at no co@@ st .
But here &apos;s the situ@@ ation : the ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy mar@@ ket is do@@ min@@ ated by three play@@ ers and three play@@ ers only — S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard &@@ amp@@ ; Po@@ or &apos;s , M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s , and F@@ it@@ ch — and we know wh@@ en@@ ever there is a mar@@ ket con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion , there is really no com@@ peti@@ tion .
There is no incen@@ tive to impro@@ ve the qu@@ ality of your produc@@ t .
And let &apos;s face it , the cre@@ di@@ t ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es have con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted , pu@@ tting the global econo@@ my on the br@@ in@@ k , and yet they have to change the way they oper@@ ate .
The second point , would you really bu@@ y a car just based on the ad@@ vi@@ ce of the de@@ al@@ er ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously not , right ? That would be ir@@ respon@@ sible .
But that &apos;s actually what &apos;s going on in the ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy sec@@ tor every single day .
The cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers of these ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , like countries or comp@@ ani@@ es , they are pa@@ ying for their own ra@@ t@@ ings , and obvi@@ ously this is cre@@ ating a con@@ fli@@ c@@ t of inter@@ est .
The th@@ ird point is , the ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ra@@ t@@ ings , but in this day and age , you can &apos;t even se@@ ll a can@@ dy b@@ ar without list@@ ing everything that &apos;s inside .
But for ra@@ t@@ ings , a cru@@ cial ele@@ ment of our econo@@ my , we really do not know what all the different ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents are .
We are al@@ lo@@ wing the ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es to be in@@ trans@@ par@@ ent about their work , and we need to change this .
I think there is no dou@@ b@@ t that the sec@@ tor nee@@ ds a comple@@ te over@@ ha@@ u@@ l , not just a tri@@ mm@@ ing at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
I think it &apos;s time for a b@@ old move .
I think it &apos;s time to u@@ p@@ gra@@ de the system .
And this is why we at the B@@ er@@ tel@@ s@@ man@@ n Fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion have inv@@ es@@ ted a lot of time and ef@@ for@@ t thinking about an alter@@ na@@ tive for the sec@@ tor .
And we have developed the first mode@@ l for a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy for so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ris@@ k , and we call it by its ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A .
I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would make a differ@@ ence to the cur@@ r@@ ent system by ad@@ ding another n@@ on@@ prof@@ it play@@ er to the mi@@ x .
It would be based on a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it mode@@ l that would be based on a s@@ us@@ tain@@ able en@@ do@@ w@@ ment .
The en@@ do@@ w@@ ment would create in@@ come that would al@@ low us to r@@ un the oper@@ ation , to r@@ un the ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy , and it would also al@@ low us to make our ra@@ t@@ ings publi@@ c@@ ly a@@ vai@@ la@@ ble .
But this is not enough to make a differ@@ ence , right ?
I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would also be based on a very , very c@@ lear govern@@ ance struc@@ ture that would a@@ vo@@ id any con@@ fli@@ c@@ t of inter@@ est , and it would inclu@@ de many sta@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ ders from socie@@ ty .
I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would not only be a Euro@@ pe@@ an or an Ameri@@ can ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ cy , it would be a tru@@ ly inter@@ national one , in which , in particular , the emer@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es would have an equ@@ al inter@@ est , vo@@ ice and repres@@ en@@ tation .
The second big differ@@ ence that I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would make is that would it base its so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ris@@ k as@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ ment on a bro@@ ad@@ er set of indi@@ ca@@ tors .
Th@@ in@@ k about it that way .
If we con@@ duc@@ t a so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ra@@ ting , we basi@@ cally take a look at the econo@@ mic so@@ il of a country , its mac@@ ro@@ econo@@ mic funda@@ men@@ tal@@ s .
But we also have to ask the question , who is cul@@ tiv@@ ating the econo@@ mic so@@ il of a country , right ?
Well , a country has many gar@@ den@@ ers , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country go@@ ver@@ ned ?
How is it man@@ ag@@ ed ?
And this is the reason why we have developed what we call for@@ war@@ d-@@ looking indi@@ ca@@ tors .
These are indi@@ ca@@ tors that give you a much better read about the soci@@ o@@ econo@@ mic develo@@ p@@ ment of a country .
I hope you would ag@@ ree it &apos;s important for you to know if your government is wi@@ lling to inv@@ est in ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy and education .
For example , if I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would rate S@@ outh Africa right now , of course we would take a very , very clo@@ se look at the y@@ outh un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment of the country , the high@@ est in the world .
If over 70 percent of a country &apos;s population under the age of 3@@ 5 is un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , of course this has a hu@@ ge impac@@ t on the econo@@ my today and even more so in the future .
Well , our fri@@ ends at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s , S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard &@@ amp@@ ; Po@@ or &apos;s , and F@@ it@@ ch will tell us we would take this into ac@@ coun@@ t as well .
But gu@@ ess what ? We do not know exactly how they will take this into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And this le@@ ads me to the th@@ ird big differ@@ ence that I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would make .
I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would not only re@@ le@@ ase its ra@@ t@@ ings but it would also re@@ le@@ ase its indi@@ ca@@ tors and me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ logy .
So in contra@@ st to the cur@@ r@@ ent system , I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would be ful@@ ly trans@@ par@@ ent .
So in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A would of@@ fer an alter@@ na@@ tive to the cur@@ r@@ ent system of the big three ra@@ ting ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es by ad@@ ding a new , n@@ on@@ prof@@ it play@@ er to the mi@@ x that would incre@@ ase the com@@ peti@@ tion , it would incre@@ ase the trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy of the sec@@ tor , and it would also incre@@ ase the qu@@ ality .
I can tell that so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ra@@ t@@ ings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very comple@@ x global finan@@ cial world , but I tell you it &apos;s a very important one , and a very important one to fi@@ x , because so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n ra@@ t@@ ings af@@ fec@@ t all of us , and they should be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed and should be defin@@ ed as publi@@ c go@@ o@@ ds .
And this is why we are t@@ esting our mode@@ l right now , and why we are trying to find out if it can br@@ ing together a gro@@ up of able and wi@@ lling ac@@ tors to br@@ ing I@@ N@@ C@@ R@@ A to life .
Because for way too long , we have left the big finan@@ cial play@@ ers on their own .
It &apos;s time to give them some comp@@ any .
Thank you .

I still remember the day in school when our teach@@ er told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 .
I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has chan@@ ged from that year and into the future , but I will not use di@@ gi@@ tal technology , as I &apos;ve done dur@@ ing my first five TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks .
In@@ stead , I have pro@@ g@@ res@@ sed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ching a br@@ and new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x .
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
And our teach@@ er told us that the industri@@ aliz@@ ed world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people .
In the develo@@ ping world , she said , they had two billion people .
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the industri@@ aliz@@ ed world and the two billion in the develo@@ ping world .
In the industri@@ aliz@@ ed world , people were health@@ y , edu@@ ca@@ ted , ri@@ ch , and they had small famili@@ es .
And their as@@ pira@@ tion was to bu@@ y a car .
And in 19@@ 60 , all S@@ we@@ des were sa@@ ving to try to bu@@ y a V@@ ol@@ vo like this .
This was the econo@@ mic level at which S@@ we@@ den was .
But in contra@@ st to this , in the develo@@ ping world , far away , the as@@ pira@@ tion of the a@@ ver@@ age family there was to have food for the day .
They were sa@@ ving to be able to bu@@ y a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
There was an enor@@ mous ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the res@@ t has cre@@ ated a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use lingu@@ is@@ tically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the De@@ velo@@ ping W@@ or@@ ld . &quot; &quot; But the world has chan@@ ged , and it &apos;s over@@ du@@ e to u@@ p@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ o@@ my of the world , and to understand it .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because sin@@ ce 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a sta@@ gg@@ er@@ ing four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population .
J@@ ust look how many .
The world population has dou@@ b@@ led sin@@ ce I went to school .
And of course , there &apos;s been econo@@ mic gro@@ w@@ th in the W@@ est .
A lot of comp@@ ani@@ es have happened to grow the econo@@ my , so the W@@ est@@ er@@ n population mo@@ ved over to here .
And now their as@@ pira@@ tion is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ m@@ ote dest@@ in@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
And the most suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful of the develo@@ ping countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become emer@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es , we call them .
They are now bu@@ ying car@@ s .
And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese comp@@ any , Ge@@ e@@ ly , they ac@@ qui@@ red the V@@ ol@@ vo comp@@ any , and then finally the S@@ we@@ des underst@@ o@@ od that something big had happened in the world .
( Laughter ) So there they are .
And the tra@@ ge@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is stru@@ gg@@ ling for food and sho@@ es , they are still almost as po@@ or as they were 50 years ago .
The new thing is that we have the bi@@ gg@@ est pi@@ le of bi@@ llions , the three bi@@ llions here , which are also be@@ coming emer@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es , because they are quite health@@ y , rela@@ tively w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ edu@@ ca@@ ted , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; ri@@ ch@@ er also &#93; have .
And their as@@ pira@@ tion now is , of course , to bu@@ y a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , and then later on they would like to have a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke also .
But this is the world we have today , no lon@@ ger any ga@@ p .
But the dist@@ ance from the po@@ or@@ est here , the very po@@ or@@ est , to the very ri@@ ch@@ est over here is wi@@ der than ever .
But there is a continu@@ ous world from wal@@ king , bi@@ king , dri@@ ving , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people ten@@ d to be some@@ where in the mi@@ d@@ dle .
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 20@@ 50 .
I was in S@@ han@@ g@@ hai rec@@ ently , and I listen@@ ed to what &apos;s happen@@ ing in Ch@@ ina , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will ca@@ t@@ ch up , just as J@@ ap@@ an did .
All the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
&#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with se@@ ven , ei@@ ght percent , and then they will end up here .
They will start fl@@ ying .
And these lo@@ wer or mi@@ d@@ dle in@@ come countries , the emer@@ ging in@@ come countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ war@@ ds econo@@ mi@@ cally .
And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right green technology — so that we can a@@ vo@@ id se@@ ver@@ e climate change , and energy can still be rela@@ tively che@@ a@@ p — then they will move all the way up here .
And they will start to bu@@ y elec@@ tri@@ c car@@ s .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the po@@ or@@ est two billion ?
What about the po@@ or@@ est two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
Well , here population &#91; gro@@ w@@ th &#93; comes in because there &#91; a@@ mon@@ g emer@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ ide@@ ly used , and population gro@@ w@@ th is coming to an end .
Here &#91; a@@ mon@@ g the po@@ or@@ est &#93; , population is gro@@ wing .
So these &#91; po@@ or@@ est &#93; two billion will , in the next deca@@ des , incre@@ ase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after incre@@ ase to four billion .
There is nothing — but a nuc@@ lear w@@ ar of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; gro@@ w@@ th &#93; from happen@@ ing .
Because we already have this &#91; gro@@ w@@ th &#93; in process .
But if , and only if , &#91; the po@@ or@@ est &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child sur@@ viv@@ al , they can bu@@ y a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle and a cell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population gro@@ w@@ th will stop in 20@@ 50 .
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and sho@@ es because then we get continu@@ ed population gro@@ w@@ th .
And let me show you why by conver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d-@@ time di@@ gi@@ tal technology .
Here I have on the s@@ cre@@ en my country bu@@ b@@ bles .
E@@ very bu@@ b@@ ble is a country . The size is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ el@@ low on there is the Amer@@ icas ; dar@@ k blue is Africa ; bro@@ wn is Europe ; green is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast and this light blue is S@@ outh A@@ si@@ a .
That &apos;s In@@ dia and this is Ch@@ ina . S@@ i@@ ze is population .
Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , ei@@ ght children — big famili@@ es , small famili@@ es .
The year is 19@@ 60 .
And down here , child sur@@ viv@@ al , the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of children sur@@ vi@@ ving chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and health@@ i@@ est countries .
But look , this is the world my teach@@ er tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion W@@ est@@ er@@ n world here — high chil@@ d-@@ sur@@ viv@@ al , small famili@@ es — and all the res@@ t , the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w of develo@@ ping countries , with very lar@@ ge famili@@ es and po@@ or child sur@@ viv@@ al .
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child sur@@ viv@@ al is incre@@ as@@ ing ?
They get so@@ a@@ p , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , vac@@ cin@@ ation , pen@@ i@@ ci@@ lli@@ n and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ ami@@ ly size is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
&#91; When &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0@@ -@@ percent child sur@@ viv@@ al , then famili@@ es de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the A@@ ra@@ b countries in the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast is fal@@ ling down there &#91; to small famili@@ es &#93; .
L@@ oo@@ k , B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h ca@@ t@@ ching up with In@@ dia .
The whole emer@@ ging world jo@@ ins the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world with good child sur@@ viv@@ al and small family size , but we still have the po@@ or@@ est billion .
C@@ an you see the po@@ or@@ est billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ xes I had over here ?
They are still up here .
And they still have a child sur@@ viv@@ al of only 70 to 80 percent , me@@ an@@ ing that if you have six children bor@@ n , there will be at le@@ ast four who sur@@ vi@@ ve to the next gener@@ ation .
And the population will dou@@ ble in one gener@@ ation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; gro@@ w@@ th &#93; to stop is to continu@@ e to impro@@ ve child sur@@ viv@@ al to 90 percent .
That &apos;s why inv@@ est@@ ments by G@@ ates Fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organi@@ z@@ ations , together with national government in the po@@ or@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a s@@ us@@ tain@@ able population size of the world .
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
Ch@@ il@@ d sur@@ viv@@ al is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child sur@@ viv@@ al that we will stop population gro@@ w@@ th .
And will it happen ?
Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , ne@@ i@@ ther am I a pes@@ simi@@ st .
I &apos;m a very seri@@ ous &quot; &quot; pos@@ si@@ bili@@ st . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory where we take emo@@ tion a@@ part , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tically with the world .
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
W@@ ith green technology and with inv@@ est@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this .
And look at the posi@@ tion of the old W@@ est .
Re@@ member when this blue bo@@ x was all al@@ one , le@@ ad@@ ing the world , living its own life .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of the moder@@ n world — nothing more , nothing less .
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
D@@ o it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

This is the L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron C@@ ol@@ li@@ der .
It &apos;s 2@@ 7 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters in cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence .
It &apos;s the bi@@ gg@@ est scienti@@ fic experi@@ ment ever at@@ temp@@ ted .
O@@ ver 10@@ ,000 physi@@ ci@@ sts and eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers from 8@@ 5 countries around the world have come together over se@@ ver@@ al deca@@ des to build this mach@@ ine .
What we do is we ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate pr@@ ot@@ ons — so , hy@@ dro@@ gen nuc@@ le@@ i — around 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9 percent the spe@@ ed of light .
R@@ ight ? A@@ t that spe@@ ed , they go around that 2@@ 7 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters 1@@ 1@@ ,000 times a second .
And we co@@ lli@@ de them with another be@@ am of pr@@ ot@@ ons going in the op@@ posi@@ te direc@@ tion .
We co@@ lli@@ de them inside gi@@ ant detec@@ tors .
They &apos;re es@@ senti@@ ally di@@ gi@@ tal ca@@ mer@@ as .
And this is the one that I work on , A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
You get some sense of the size — you can just see these E@@ U stan@@ dar@@ d-@@ size people under@@ ne@@ ath .
( Laughter ) You get some sense of the size : 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in dia@@ me@@ ter , 7@@ ,000 t@@ ons .
And we re@@ -@@ create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe beg@@ an up to 6@@ 00 million times a second inside that detec@@ tor — im@@ men@@ se nu@@ mb@@ ers .
And if you see those me@@ tal b@@ its there — those are hu@@ ge ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts that b@@ end elec@@ tri@@ cally char@@ ged partic@@ les , so it can meas@@ ure how f@@ ast they &apos;re tra@@ vel@@ ing .
This is a picture about a year ago .
Th@@ ose ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts are in there .
And , again , a E@@ U stan@@ dar@@ d-@@ size , real person , so you get some sense of the s@@ cal@@ e .
And it &apos;s in there that those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ gs will be cre@@ ated , some@@ time in the su@@ mm@@ er this year .
And actually , this mor@@ ning , I got an e@@ mai@@ l saying that we &apos;ve just fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , today , buil@@ ding the last piece of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
So as of today , it &apos;s fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed . I &apos;d like to say that I plan@@ ned that for TED , but I didn &apos;t . So it &apos;s been comple@@ ted as of today .
( Applause ) Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s a wonderful ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment .
So , you might be as@@ king , &quot; &quot; Why ?
Why create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe beg@@ an ? &quot; &quot; Well , partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ sts are nothing if not ambi@@ ti@@ ous .
And the ai@@ m of partic@@ le physi@@ cs is to understand what everything &apos;s made of , and how everything stic@@ ks together .
And by everything I mean , of course , me and you , the Earth , the S@@ un , the 100 billion s@@ uns in our gal@@ ax@@ y and the 100 billion gal@@ axi@@ es in the observ@@ able universe .
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely everything .
Now you might say , &quot; &quot; Well , O@@ K , but why not just look at it ?
You know ? If you want to know what I &apos;m made of , let &apos;s look at me . &quot; &quot; Well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets h@@ ot@@ ter and h@@ ot@@ ter , den@@ ser and den@@ ser , and simp@@ ler and simp@@ ler .
Now , there &apos;s no real reason I &apos;m aw@@ are of for that , but that see@@ ms to be the case .
So , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and underst@@ an@@ da@@ ble .
All this comple@@ x@@ ity , all the way to these wonderful things — human bra@@ ins — are a pro@@ per@@ ty of an old and co@@ ld and comp@@ lica@@ ted universe .
B@@ ack at the start , in the first bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a second , we believe , or we &apos;ve obser@@ ved , it was very simple .
It &apos;s almost like ...
imagine a s@@ no@@ w@@ f@@ la@@ ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incre@@ di@@ bly comp@@ lica@@ ted , beautiful ob@@ ject . But as you he@@ at it up , it &apos;ll mel@@ t into a po@@ ol of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of H@@ 20 , water .
So it &apos;s in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of .
And , as of today , it &apos;s made of these things .
J@@ ust 12 partic@@ les of matter , st@@ uc@@ k together by four for@@ ces of n@@ ature .
The qu@@ ar@@ ks , these p@@ in@@ k things , are the things that make up pr@@ ot@@ ons and neu@@ tro@@ ns that make up the ato@@ mic nuc@@ le@@ i in your body .
The elec@@ tr@@ on — the thing that goes around the ato@@ mic nuc@@ le@@ us — hel@@ d around in or@@ bit , by the way , by the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic for@@ ce that &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed by this thing , the phot@@ on .
The qu@@ ar@@ ks are st@@ uc@@ k together by other things called g@@ lu@@ ons .
And these gu@@ ys , here , they &apos;re the we@@ ak nuc@@ lear for@@ ce , probably the le@@ ast famili@@ ar .
But , without it , the s@@ un w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t sh@@ ine .
And when the s@@ un sh@@ in@@ es , you get co@@ pi@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of these things , called neu@@ tr@@ in@@ os , po@@ ur@@ ing out .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , if you just look at your th@@ u@@ mb@@ na@@ il — about a s@@ qu@@ are cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter — there are something like 60 billion neu@@ tr@@ in@@ os per second from the s@@ un , pas@@ sing through every s@@ qu@@ are cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter of your body .
But you don &apos;t feel them , because the we@@ ak for@@ ce is correc@@ tly na@@ med — very sh@@ or@@ t ran@@ ge and very we@@ ak , so they just f@@ ly through you .
And these partic@@ les have been disco@@ vered over the last cent@@ ur@@ y , pretty much .
The first one , the elec@@ tr@@ on , was disco@@ vered in 1@@ 8@@ 9@@ 7 , and the last one , this thing called the ta@@ u neu@@ tr@@ ino , in the year 2@@ 000 . A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally just — I was going to say , just up the ro@@ ad in C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go . I know it &apos;s a big country , America , isn &apos;t it ?
J@@ ust up the ro@@ ad .
Re@@ la@@ tive to the universe , it &apos;s just up the ro@@ ad .
( Laughter ) So , this thing was disco@@ vered in the year 2@@ 000 , so it &apos;s a rela@@ tively rec@@ ent picture .
One of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we &apos;ve disco@@ vered any of them , when you realiz@@ e how tin@@ y they are .
You know , they &apos;re a ste@@ p in size from the entire observ@@ able universe .
So , 100 billion gal@@ axi@@ es , 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion light years away — a ste@@ p in size from that to M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , actually , is about the same as from M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey to these things .
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely , ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely minu@@ te , and yet we &apos;ve disco@@ vered pretty much the full set .
So , one of my most ill@@ u@@ stri@@ ous fo@@ re@@ be@@ ar@@ s at Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter Uni@@ versi@@ ty , E@@ r@@ n@@ est R@@ u@@ ther@@ for@@ d , disco@@ ver@@ er of the ato@@ mic nuc@@ le@@ us , on@@ ce said , &quot; &quot; All science is ei@@ ther physi@@ cs or sta@@ m@@ p col@@ lec@@ ting . &quot; &quot; Now , I don &apos;t think he me@@ ant to in@@ sul@@ t the res@@ t of science , al@@ though he was from Ne@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , so it &apos;s possible .
( Laughter ) But what he me@@ ant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is sta@@ m@@ p col@@ lec@@ t there .
O@@ K , we &apos;ve disco@@ vered the partic@@ les , but un@@ less you understand the under@@ l@@ ying reason for that pa@@ tter@@ n — you know , why it &apos;s buil@@ t the way it is — really you &apos;ve done sta@@ m@@ p col@@ lec@@ ting . You ha@@ ven &apos;t done science .
F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately , we have probably one of the gre@@ at@@ est scienti@@ fic ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ments of the tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y that under@@ p@@ ins that pa@@ tter@@ n .
It &apos;s the Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s la@@ ws , if you want , of partic@@ le physi@@ cs .
It &apos;s called the stan@@ d@@ ard mode@@ l — beauti@@ ful@@ ly simple ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical equ@@ ation .
You could stic@@ k it on the front of a T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , which is always the si@@ g@@ n of ele@@ g@@ ance .
This is it .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been a little dis@@ ing@@ en@@ u@@ ous , because I &apos;ve ex@@ pan@@ ded it out in all its g@@ ory de@@ ta@@ il .
This equ@@ ation , though , al@@ lo@@ ws you to cal@@ cu@@ late everything — other than gra@@ vi@@ ty — that happens in the universe .
So , you want to know why the sk@@ y is blue , why ato@@ mic nuc@@ le@@ i stic@@ k together — in princi@@ ple , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer — why DNA is the s@@ hap@@ e it is .
In princi@@ ple , you should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late it from that equ@@ ation .
But there &apos;s a problem .
C@@ an any@@ one see what it is ?
A bot@@ t@@ le of cha@@ m@@ pa@@ g@@ ne for any@@ one that te@@ lls me .
I &apos;ll make it e@@ asi@@ er , actually , by blo@@ wing one of the lin@@ es up .
B@@ asi@@ cally , each of these ter@@ ms re@@ fer@@ s to some of the partic@@ les .
So those W@@ s there ref@@ er to the W@@ s , and how they stic@@ k together .
These car@@ ri@@ ers of the we@@ ak for@@ ce , the Z@@ s , the same .
But there &apos;s an ex@@ tra sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l in this equ@@ ation : H@@ .
R@@ ight , H@@ .
H stan@@ ds for H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ le .
H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les have not been disco@@ vered .
But they &apos;re neces@@ s@@ ary : they &apos;re neces@@ s@@ ary to make that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics work .
So all the ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely de@@ ta@@ i@@ led cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be possible without an ex@@ tra bit .
So it &apos;s a pre@@ dic@@ tion : a pre@@ dic@@ tion of a new partic@@ le .
What does it do ?
Well , we had a long time to come up with good anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es .
And back in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , when we wanted the money for the L@@ H@@ C from the U.@@ K@@ . government , Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ ha@@ t@@ ch@@ er , at the time , said , &quot; &quot; If you gu@@ ys can ex@@ pla@@ in , in language a poli@@ tici@@ an can understand , what the h@@ ell it is that you &apos;re doing , you can have the money .
I want to know what this H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ le does . &quot; &quot; And we came up with this anal@@ o@@ gy , and it see@@ med to work .
Well , what the H@@ ig@@ gs does is , it gi@@ ves ma@@ ss to the funda@@ mental partic@@ les .
And the picture is that the whole universe — and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you — the whole universe is full of something called a H@@ ig@@ gs fiel@@ d .
H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les , if you will .
The anal@@ o@@ gy is that these people in a room are the H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les .
Now when a partic@@ le mo@@ ves through the universe , it can interac@@ t with these H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les .
But imagine someone who &apos;s not very popu@@ lar mo@@ ves through the room .
Then everyone ig@@ n@@ ores them . They can just pas@@ s through the room very qu@@ ick@@ ly , es@@ senti@@ ally at the spe@@ ed of light . They &apos;re mas@@ s@@ less .
And imagine someone incre@@ di@@ bly important and popu@@ lar and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent wal@@ ks into the room .
They &apos;re sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by people , and their pas@@ sa@@ ge through the room is im@@ pe@@ ded .
It &apos;s almost like they get he@@ av@@ y . They get mas@@ sive .
And that &apos;s exactly the way the H@@ ig@@ gs me@@ chan@@ ism works .
The picture is that the elec@@ tro@@ ns and the qu@@ ar@@ ks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are he@@ av@@ y , in a sense , and mas@@ sive , because they &apos;re sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les .
They &apos;re interac@@ ting with the H@@ ig@@ gs fiel@@ d .
If that picture &apos;s true , then we have to disco@@ ver those H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les at the L@@ H@@ C .
If it &apos;s not true — because it &apos;s quite a con@@ volu@@ ted me@@ chan@@ ism , al@@ though it &apos;s the simp@@ l@@ est we &apos;ve been able to think of — then w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver does the job of the H@@ ig@@ gs partic@@ les we know have to turn up at the L@@ H@@ C .
So , that &apos;s one of the pri@@ me reas@@ ons we buil@@ t this gi@@ ant mach@@ ine .
I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d you recogni@@ ze Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ ha@@ t@@ ch@@ er .
A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally , I thought about making it more cul@@ tur@@ ally re@@ lev@@ ant , but — ( Laughter ) any@@ way .
So that &apos;s one thing .
That &apos;s es@@ senti@@ ally a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e of what the L@@ H@@ C will find .
There are many other things . You &apos;ve heard many of the big problems in partic@@ le physi@@ cs .
One of them you heard about : dar@@ k matter , dar@@ k energy .
There &apos;s another is@@ su@@ e , which is that the for@@ ces in n@@ ature — it &apos;s quite beautiful , actually — see@@ m , as you go back in time , they see@@ m to change in str@@ eng@@ th .
Well , they do change in str@@ eng@@ th .
So , the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic for@@ ce , the for@@ ce that h@@ ol@@ ds us together , gets st@@ ron@@ ger as you go to high@@ er tem@@ per@@ atur@@ es .
The st@@ rong for@@ ce , the st@@ rong nuc@@ lear for@@ ce , which stic@@ ks nuc@@ le@@ i together , gets we@@ a@@ ker . And what you see is the stan@@ d@@ ard mode@@ l — you can cal@@ cu@@ late how these change — is the for@@ ces , the three for@@ ces , other than gra@@ vi@@ ty , almost see@@ m to come together at one point .
It &apos;s almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super@@ -@@ for@@ ce , back at the beg@@ in@@ ning of time .
But they just mi@@ ss .
Now there &apos;s a the@@ ory called super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try , which dou@@ bles the number of partic@@ les in the stan@@ d@@ ard mode@@ l , which , at first si@@ ght , doesn &apos;t sound like a simp@@ li@@ fi@@ cation .
But actually , with this the@@ ory , we find that the for@@ ces of n@@ ature do see@@ m to uni@@ f@@ y together , back at the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g — absolu@@ tely beautiful pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y . The mode@@ l was@@ n &apos;t buil@@ t to do that , but it see@@ ms to do it .
Al@@ so , those super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c partic@@ les are very st@@ rong can@@ di@@ da@@ tes for the dar@@ k matter .
So a very com@@ pe@@ lling the@@ ory that &apos;s really ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am physi@@ cs .
And if I was to put money on it , I would put money on — in a very un@@ scienti@@ fic way — that that these things would also cro@@ p up at the L@@ H@@ C .
M@@ any other things that the L@@ H@@ C could disco@@ ver .
But in the last few minu@@ tes , I just want to give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive of what I think — what partic@@ le physi@@ cs really means to me — partic@@ le physi@@ cs and co@@ s@@ mo@@ logy .
And that &apos;s that I think it &apos;s given us a wonderful n@@ arra@@ tive — almost a cre@@ ation story , if you &apos;d like — about the universe , from moder@@ n science over the last few deca@@ des .
And I &apos;d say that it des@@ er@@ ves , in the spi@@ ri@@ t of W@@ ade D@@ av@@ is &apos; talk , to be at le@@ ast put up there with these wonderful cre@@ ation stories of the pe@@ op@@ les of the high An@@ des and the fro@@ z@@ en nor@@ th .
This is a cre@@ ation story , I think , equ@@ ally as wonderful .
The story goes like this : we know that the universe beg@@ an 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago , in an im@@ men@@ se@@ ly ho@@ t , den@@ se sta@@ te , much s@@ mal@@ ler than a single ato@@ m .
It beg@@ an to ex@@ p@@ and about a million , billion , billion , billion bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a second — I think I got that right — after the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
Gra@@ vi@@ ty separ@@ ated away from the other for@@ ces .
The universe then under@@ went an ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al ex@@ pan@@ sion called inf@@ lation .
In about the first bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a second or so , the H@@ ig@@ gs fiel@@ d k@@ ic@@ ked in , and the qu@@ ar@@ ks and the g@@ lu@@ ons and the elec@@ tro@@ ns that make us up got ma@@ ss .
The universe continu@@ ed to ex@@ p@@ and and co@@ ol .
Af@@ ter about a few minu@@ tes , there was hy@@ dro@@ gen and he@@ li@@ um in the universe . That &apos;s all .
The universe was about 7@@ 5 percent hy@@ dro@@ gen , 25 percent he@@ li@@ um . It still is today .
It continu@@ ed to ex@@ p@@ and about 3@@ 00 million years .
Then light beg@@ an to tra@@ vel through the universe .
It was big enough to be trans@@ par@@ ent to light , and that &apos;s what we see in the co@@ s@@ mic micro@@ wa@@ ve bac@@ k@@ ground that Ge@@ or@@ ge S@@ mo@@ o@@ t descri@@ bed as looking at the face of God .
Af@@ ter about 4@@ 00 million years , the first star@@ s for@@ med , and that hy@@ dro@@ gen , that he@@ li@@ um , then beg@@ an to co@@ ok into the he@@ avi@@ er ele@@ ments .
So the ele@@ ments of life — car@@ b@@ on , and o@@ x@@ y@@ gen and ir@@ on , all the ele@@ ments that we need to make us up — were co@@ o@@ ked in those first gener@@ ations of star@@ s , which then ran out of fu@@ el , ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ded , th@@ re@@ w those ele@@ ments back into the universe .
They then re@@ -@@ col@@ la@@ p@@ sed into another gener@@ ation of star@@ s and plane@@ ts .
And on some of those plane@@ ts , the o@@ x@@ y@@ gen , which had been cre@@ ated in that first gener@@ ation of star@@ s , could f@@ use with hy@@ dro@@ gen to form water , li@@ qui@@ d water on the sur@@ face .
O@@ n at le@@ ast one , and maybe only one of those plane@@ ts , pri@@ mi@@ tive life e@@ vol@@ ved , which e@@ vol@@ ved over mi@@ llions of years into things that wal@@ ked u@@ pri@@ ght and left fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ ts about three and a half million years ago in the mu@@ d f@@ la@@ ts of T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia , and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally left a fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int on another world .
And buil@@ t this ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , this wonderful picture , that tur@@ ned the dar@@ k@@ ness into light , and you can see the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation from space .
As one of my great her@@ o@@ es , Car@@ l S@@ ag@@ an , said , these are the things — and actually , not only these , but I was looking around — these are the things , like S@@ atur@@ n V ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , and S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and DNA , and liter@@ ature and science — these are the things that hy@@ dro@@ gen ato@@ ms do when given 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion years .
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
And , the la@@ ws of physi@@ cs . R@@ ight ?
So , the right la@@ ws of physi@@ cs — they &apos;re beauti@@ ful@@ ly bal@@ an@@ ced .
If the we@@ ak for@@ ce had been a little bit different , then car@@ b@@ on and o@@ x@@ y@@ gen w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be sta@@ ble inside the hear@@ ts of star@@ s , and there would be n@@ one of that in the universe .
And I think that &apos;s a wonderful and signifi@@ can@@ t story .
50 years ago , I coul@@ dn &apos;t have told that story , because we didn &apos;t know it .
It makes me really feel that that ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation — which , as I say , if you believe the scienti@@ fic cre@@ ation story , has emer@@ ged pu@@ re@@ ly as a resul@@ t of the la@@ ws of physi@@ cs , and a few hy@@ dro@@ gen ato@@ ms — then I think , to me any@@ way , it makes me feel incre@@ di@@ bly valu@@ able .
So that &apos;s the L@@ H@@ C .
The L@@ H@@ C is cer@@ tain@@ ly , when it tur@@ ns on in su@@ mm@@ er , going to wri@@ te the next cha@@ p@@ ter of that book .
And I &apos;m cer@@ tain@@ ly looking for@@ ward with im@@ men@@ se exci@@ te@@ ment to it being tur@@ ned on .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
De@@ mo@@ cra@@ cy .
In the W@@ est , we make a co@@ lo@@ s@@ sa@@ l mi@@ sta@@ ke taking it for gran@@ ted .
We ten@@ d to think of it as an in@@ tr@@ an@@ si@@ g@@ ent given .
We mi@@ sta@@ k@@ en@@ ly believe that cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism be@@ gets in@@ evi@@ ta@@ bly democra@@ cy .
It doesn &apos;t .
S@@ ing@@ a@@ po@@ re &apos;s Le@@ e K@@ u@@ an Y@@ e@@ w and his great imi@@ ta@@ tors in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing have de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted be@@ y@@ on@@ d reas@@ on@@ able dou@@ b@@ t that it is perfec@@ tly possible to have a fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism , spec@@ ta@@ cular gro@@ w@@ th , while poli@@ tics rema@@ ins democra@@ cy@@ -@@ f@@ ree .
In@@ de@@ ed , democra@@ cy is rece@@ ding in our nec@@ k of the w@@ oo@@ ds , here in Europe .
A@@ t that moment , I fel@@ t that there could be no gre@@ ater v@@ indi@@ cation of Le@@ e K@@ u@@ an Y@@ e@@ w , or the Ch@@ in@@ ese Co@@ m@@ mun@@ ist Par@@ ty , in@@ de@@ ed of some re@@ cal@@ ci@@ tr@@ ant fri@@ ends of min@@ e who ke@@ pt telling me that democra@@ cy would be ban@@ ned if it ever th@@ re@@ aten@@ ed to change anything .
T@@ on@@ ight , here , I want to present to you an econo@@ mic case for an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c democra@@ cy .
I want to ask you to jo@@ in me in belie@@ ving again that Le@@ e K@@ u@@ an Y@@ e@@ w , the Ch@@ in@@ ese Co@@ m@@ mun@@ ist Par@@ ty and in@@ de@@ ed the Euro@@ gro@@ up are wrong in belie@@ ving that we can dis@@ pen@@ se with democra@@ cy — that we need an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c , bo@@ ist@@ er@@ ous democra@@ cy .
And without democra@@ cy , our socie@@ ties will be n@@ as@@ ti@@ er , our future b@@ lea@@ k and our great , new technolo@@ gi@@ es was@@ ted .
S@@ pe@@ a@@ king of was@@ te , al@@ low me to point out an interesting par@@ ado@@ x that is th@@ re@@ aten@@ ing our econo@@ mi@@ es as we spe@@ ak .
I call it the tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks par@@ ado@@ x .
One pe@@ ak you understand — you know it , you recogni@@ ze it — is the moun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ ts that has been ca@@ st@@ ing a long s@@ ha@@ do@@ w over the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , Europe , the whole world .
We all recogni@@ ze the moun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ ts .
But few people dis@@ cer@@ n its tw@@ in .
A moun@@ tain of id@@ le ca@@ sh be@@ lon@@ ging to ri@@ ch sa@@ ver@@ s and to cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions , too terri@@ fi@@ ed to inv@@ est it into the produc@@ tive activi@@ ties that can gener@@ ate the in@@ comes from which you can ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ is@@ h the moun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ ts and which can produ@@ ce all those things that human@@ ity des@@ per@@ ately nee@@ ds , like green energy .
Now let me give you two nu@@ mb@@ ers .
O@@ ver the last three months , in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , in Bri@@ tain and in the Euro@@ z@@ one , we have inv@@ es@@ ted , col@@ lec@@ tively , 3@@ .@@ 4 tri@@ llion dollars on all the we@@ al@@ th@@ -@@ produc@@ ing go@@ o@@ ds — things like industri@@ al plan@@ ts , mach@@ in@@ er@@ y , of@@ fi@@ ce blo@@ c@@ ks , s@@ cho@@ ols , ro@@ ads , ra@@ il@@ ways , mach@@ in@@ er@@ y , and so on and so for@@ th .
$ 3@@ .@@ 4 tri@@ llion so@@ unds like a lot of money until you compar@@ e it to the $ 5@@ .@@ 1 tri@@ llion that has been s@@ l@@ us@@ hing around in the same countries , in our finan@@ cial institu@@ tions , doing absolu@@ tely nothing dur@@ ing the same peri@@ od ex@@ cep@@ t inf@@ la@@ ting sto@@ ck ex@@ chan@@ ges and bi@@ d@@ ding up house pri@@ ces .
So a moun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ t and a moun@@ tain of id@@ le ca@@ sh form tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks , fa@@ il@@ ing to can@@ ce@@ l each other out through the normal oper@@ ation of the mar@@ ke@@ ts .
The resul@@ t is sta@@ gn@@ ant w@@ ages , more than a qu@@ ar@@ ter of 2@@ 5@@ - to 5@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds in America , in J@@ ap@@ an and in Europe out of work .
And conse@@ qu@@ ently , low ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te de@@ m@@ and , which in a ne@@ ver@@ -@@ en@@ ding cy@@ cle , re@@ in@@ for@@ ces the pes@@ simi@@ s@@ m of the inv@@ est@@ ors , who , f@@ ear@@ ing low de@@ m@@ and , re@@ produ@@ ce it by not inv@@ esting — exactly like O@@ edi@@ p@@ us &apos; fa@@ ther , who , terri@@ fi@@ ed by the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of the or@@ ac@@ le that his son would grow up to k@@ ill him , un@@ w@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed the condi@@ tions that en@@ su@@ red that O@@ edi@@ p@@ us , his son , would k@@ ill him .
This is my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism .
I@@ ts gro@@ ss was@@ te@@ ful@@ ness , all this id@@ le ca@@ sh , should be ener@@ gi@@ zed to impro@@ ve lives , to develo@@ p human tal@@ ents , and in@@ de@@ ed to fin@@ ance all these technolo@@ gi@@ es , green technolo@@ gi@@ es , which are absolu@@ tely es@@ senti@@ al for sa@@ ving plan@@ et Earth .
A@@ m I right in belie@@ ving that democra@@ cy might be the answer ?
I believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democra@@ cy ?
A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le defin@@ ed democra@@ cy as the con@@ stitu@@ tion in which the f@@ ree and the po@@ or , being in the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , control government .
Now , of course A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democra@@ cy ex@@ c@@ lu@@ ded too many .
W@@ o@@ men , mi@@ gran@@ ts and , of course , the s@@ la@@ ves .
But it would be a mi@@ sta@@ ke to dis@@ mi@@ ss the signifi@@ can@@ ce of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democra@@ cy on the bas@@ is of who@@ m it ex@@ c@@ lu@@ ded .
What was more per@@ tin@@ ent , and continu@@ es to be so about an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democra@@ cy , was the inclu@@ sion of the working po@@ or , who not only ac@@ qui@@ red the right to f@@ ree spe@@ ec@@ h , but more import@@ an@@ tly , cru@@ ci@@ ally , they ac@@ qui@@ red the ri@@ ghts to poli@@ tical j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments that were af@@ for@@ ded equ@@ al we@@ ight in the deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making con@@ cer@@ ning ma@@ t@@ ters of sta@@ te .
Now , of course , A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democra@@ cy didn &apos;t last long .
Li@@ ke a can@@ dle that bur@@ ns bri@@ gh@@ tly , it bur@@ ned out qu@@ ick@@ ly .
And in@@ de@@ ed , our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es today do not have their ro@@ ots in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens .
They have their ro@@ ots in the M@@ ag@@ na Car@@ ta , in the 1@@ 6@@ 8@@ 8 G@@ l@@ ori@@ ous Re@@ volu@@ tion , in@@ de@@ ed in the Ameri@@ can con@@ stitu@@ tion .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democra@@ cy was fo@@ c@@ using on the ma@@ ster@@ less ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en and em@@ power@@ ing the working po@@ or , our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es are fo@@ un@@ ded on the M@@ ag@@ na Car@@ ta tradi@@ tion , which was , after all , a char@@ ter for ma@@ st@@ ers .
And in@@ de@@ ed , liber@@ al democra@@ cy only sur@@ fac@@ ed when it was possible to separ@@ ate ful@@ ly the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ ere from the econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere , so as to con@@ fin@@ e the democra@@ tic process ful@@ ly in the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ ere , lea@@ ving the econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere — the cor@@ po@@ rate world , if you want — as a democra@@ cy@@ -@@ f@@ ree z@@ one .
Now , in our democra@@ ci@@ es today , this separ@@ ation of the econo@@ mic from the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ ere , the moment it started happen@@ ing , it ga@@ ve ri@@ se to an in@@ ex@@ or@@ able , e@@ pi@@ c stru@@ gg@@ le between the two , with the econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere co@@ lon@@ i@@ zing the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ ere , e@@ ating into its power .
Ha@@ ve you wonder@@ ed why poli@@ tici@@ ans are not what they used to be ?
It &apos;s not because their DNA has de@@ gener@@ ated .
( Laughter ) It is ra@@ ther because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has mi@@ gra@@ ted from the poli@@ tical to the econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere , which is separ@@ ate .
In@@ de@@ ed , I s@@ po@@ ke about my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism .
If you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of pre@@ da@@ tors , that are so suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful in deci@@ ma@@ ting the pre@@ y that they must fe@@ ed on , that in the end they star@@ ve .
S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , the econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere has been co@@ lon@@ i@@ zing and can@@ ni@@ b@@ aliz@@ ing the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ ere to such an ex@@ t@@ ent that it is under@@ min@@ ing it@@ self , ca@@ using econo@@ mic cri@@ sis .
C@@ or@@ po@@ rate power is incre@@ as@@ ing , poli@@ tical go@@ o@@ ds are de@@ valu@@ ing , in@@ equ@@ ality is ri@@ sing , ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te de@@ m@@ and is fal@@ ling and C@@ E@@ Os of cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions are too s@@ car@@ ed to inv@@ est the ca@@ sh of their cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions .
So the more cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds in taking the demos out of democra@@ cy , the tal@@ ler the tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks and the gre@@ ater the was@@ te of human res@@ our@@ ces and human@@ ity &apos;s we@@ al@@ th .
C@@ lear@@ ly , if this is right , we must re@@ uni@@ te the poli@@ tical and econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ er@@ es and better do it with a demos being in control , like in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens ex@@ cep@@ t without the s@@ la@@ ves or the ex@@ c@@ lu@@ sion of wo@@ men and mi@@ gran@@ ts .
Now , this is not an ori@@ g@@ in@@ al idea .
The Mar@@ x@@ ist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well , did it ?
The l@@ es@@ son that we learned from the So@@ vi@@ et de@@ bac@@ le is that only by a mi@@ rac@@ le will the working po@@ or be re@@ em@@ power@@ ed , as they were in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , without cre@@ ating new for@@ ms of br@@ u@@ tal@@ ity and was@@ te .
But there is a solu@@ tion : eli@@ min@@ ate the working po@@ or .
C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ ism &apos;s doing it by re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing low@@ -@@ w@@ age wor@@ kers with auto@@ ma@@ ta , an@@ dro@@ i@@ ds , ro@@ bot@@ s .
The problem is that as long as the econo@@ mic and the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ er@@ es are separ@@ ate , auto@@ ma@@ tion makes the tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks tal@@ ler , the was@@ te lo@@ f@@ ti@@ er and the social con@@ fli@@ c@@ ts de@@ e@@ per , inclu@@ ding — so@@ on , I believe — in places like Ch@@ ina .
So we need to re@@ con@@ figur@@ e , we need to re@@ uni@@ te the econo@@ mic and the poli@@ tical s@@ ph@@ er@@ es , but we &apos;d better do it by democra@@ ti@@ zing the re@@ uni@@ fi@@ ed s@@ ph@@ ere , l@@ est we end up with a sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ ma@@ d hy@@ per@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy that makes The M@@ at@@ ri@@ x , the mo@@ vi@@ e , look like a do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y .
The more interesting question is whether cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism will be suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded by something res@@ e@@ mb@@ ling a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia or something much clo@@ ser to a S@@ tar T@@ re@@ k@@ -@@ like socie@@ ty , where mach@@ in@@ es ser@@ ve the human@@ s and the human@@ s ex@@ pen@@ d their ener@@ gi@@ es ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the universe and in@@ d@@ ul@@ ging in long de@@ bat@@ es about the me@@ an@@ ing of life in some an@@ ci@@ ent , A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ like , high te@@ ch agora .
I think we can af@@ for@@ d to be op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic .
But what would it take , what would it look like to have this S@@ tar T@@ re@@ k@@ -@@ like u@@ to@@ pi@@ a , instead of the M@@ at@@ ri@@ x@@ -@@ like dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia ?
In prac@@ tical ter@@ ms , al@@ low me to share just bri@@ ef@@ ly , a cou@@ ple of examp@@ les .
A@@ t the level of the en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se , imagine a ca@@ pi@@ tal mar@@ ket , where you ear@@ n ca@@ pi@@ tal as you work , and where your ca@@ pi@@ tal fol@@ lo@@ ws you from one job to another , from one comp@@ any to another , and the comp@@ any — whi@@ che@@ ver one you happen to work at at that time — is so@@ le@@ ly o@@ w@@ ned by those who happen to work in it at that moment .
Then all in@@ come ste@@ ms from ca@@ pi@@ tal , from prof@@ its , and the very concep@@ t of w@@ age la@@ b@@ or be@@ comes ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
No more separ@@ ation between those who own but do not work in the comp@@ any and those who work but do not own the comp@@ any ; no more tu@@ g@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ w@@ ar between ca@@ pi@@ tal and la@@ b@@ or ; no great ga@@ p between inv@@ est@@ ment and sa@@ ving ; in@@ de@@ ed , no to@@ wer@@ ing tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks .
A@@ t the level of the global poli@@ tical econo@@ my , imagine for a moment that our national cur@@ ren@@ ci@@ es have a f@@ ree@@ -@@ flo@@ ating ex@@ change rate , with a univer@@ sa@@ l , global , di@@ gi@@ tal cur@@ ren@@ cy , one that is is@@ su@@ ed by the Inter@@ national M@@ on@@ e@@ tar@@ y F@@ und , the G@@ -@@ 20 , on be@@ half of all human@@ ity .
And imagine f@@ ur@@ ther that all inter@@ national tra@@ de is den@@ o@@ min@@ ated in this cur@@ ren@@ cy — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; the co@@ s@@ mos , &quot; &quot; in un@@ its of co@@ s@@ mos — with every government ag@@ ree@@ ing to be pa@@ ying into a common f@@ und a su@@ m of co@@ s@@ mos un@@ its pro@@ por@@ tional to the country &apos;s tra@@ de de@@ fici@@ t , or in@@ de@@ ed to a country &apos;s tra@@ de sur@@ pl@@ us .
And imagine that that f@@ und is utili@@ zed to inv@@ est in green technolo@@ gi@@ es , especi@@ ally in par@@ ts of the world where inv@@ est@@ ment fun@@ ding is s@@ car@@ ce .
This is not a new idea .
It &apos;s what , effec@@ tively , Jo@@ h@@ n Ma@@ y@@ n@@ ard K@@ ey@@ n@@ es pro@@ pos@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 4 at the B@@ re@@ tt@@ on W@@ oo@@ ds Con@@ fer@@ ence .
The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to imp@@ le@@ ment it .
Now we do , especi@@ ally in the con@@ text of a re@@ uni@@ fi@@ ed poli@@ tic@@ al@@ -@@ econo@@ mic s@@ ph@@ ere .
The world that I am descri@@ b@@ ing to you is si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously liber@@ t@@ ari@@ an , in that it pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ es em@@ power@@ ed individu@@ als , Mar@@ x@@ ist , sin@@ ce it will have con@@ fin@@ ed to the du@@ st@@ b@@ in of hist@@ ory the divi@@ sion between ca@@ pi@@ tal and la@@ b@@ or , and K@@ ey@@ n@@ esi@@ an , global K@@ ey@@ n@@ esi@@ an .
But ab@@ o@@ ve all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c democra@@ cy .
W@@ ill such a world da@@ wn ?
O@@ r sh@@ all we des@@ cen@@ d into a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x@@ -@@ like dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia ?
The answer li@@ es in the poli@@ tical cho@@ ice that we sh@@ all be making col@@ lec@@ tively .
It is our cho@@ ice , and we &apos;d better make it democra@@ tically .
Thank you .
( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Y@@ an@@ is ...
It was you who descri@@ bed yourself in your bi@@ os as a liber@@ t@@ ari@@ an Mar@@ x@@ ist .
What is the re@@ lev@@ ance of Mar@@ x &apos;s anal@@ y@@ sis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is V@@ ar@@ ou@@ fa@@ k@@ is : Well , if there was any re@@ lev@@ ance in what I just said , then Mar@@ x is re@@ lev@@ ant .
Because the whole point of re@@ uni@@ f@@ ying the poli@@ tical and econo@@ mic is — if we don &apos;t do it , then technolo@@ gi@@ cal in@@ no@@ va@@ tion is going to create such a mas@@ sive f@@ all in ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te de@@ m@@ and , what L@@ ar@@ ry Su@@ mm@@ ers re@@ fer@@ s to as se@@ cular sta@@ g@@ na@@ tion .
W@@ ith this cri@@ sis mi@@ gra@@ ting from one part of the world , as it is now , it will des@@ ta@@ bili@@ ze not only our democra@@ ci@@ es , but even the emer@@ ging world that is not that ke@@ en on liber@@ al democra@@ cy .
So if this anal@@ y@@ sis h@@ ol@@ ds water , then Mar@@ x is absolu@@ tely re@@ lev@@ ant .
But so is Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ ari@@ an Mar@@ x@@ ist , and so is K@@ ey@@ n@@ es , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m tot@@ ally con@@ fu@@ sed .
( Applause ) Y@@ V : If you are not con@@ fu@@ sed , you are not thinking , O@@ K ?
W@@ ould you like to share that ?
Y@@ V : Well , there &apos;s a great de@@ gre@@ e of hy@@ po@@ cri@@ s@@ y .
In our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es , we have a se@@ mb@@ lan@@ ce of democra@@ cy .
In a sense , if I am al@@ low@@ ed to be provo@@ ca@@ tive , Ch@@ ina today is clo@@ ser to Bri@@ tain in the 19@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y .
Because remember , we ten@@ d to as@@ soci@@ ate liber@@ al@@ ism with democra@@ cy — that &apos;s a mi@@ sta@@ ke , hist@@ or@@ ic@@ ally .
Li@@ ber@@ al@@ ism , liber@@ al , it &apos;s like Jo@@ h@@ n S@@ tu@@ art M@@ ill .
Jo@@ h@@ n S@@ tu@@ art M@@ ill was partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about the democra@@ tic process .
So what you are see@@ ing now in Ch@@ ina is a very similar process to the one that we had in Bri@@ tain dur@@ ing the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al Re@@ volu@@ tion , especi@@ ally the tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion from the first to the second .
And to be ca@@ sti@@ g@@ ating Ch@@ ina for doing that which the W@@ est did in the 19@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y , s@@ mac@@ ks of hy@@ po@@ cri@@ s@@ y .
B@@ G : I am sure that many people here are wonder@@ ing about your experience as the Fin@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of Gre@@ ece ear@@ li@@ er this year .
Y@@ V : I knew this was coming .
B@@ G : Y@@ es .
B@@ G : S@@ i@@ x months after , how do you look back at the first half of the year ?
No@@ t just Gre@@ ece , the Euro@@ z@@ one .
To move away from the com@@ pl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy and the con@@ st@@ ant den@@ ial that there was a mas@@ sive — and there is a mas@@ sive ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ tural fa@@ ul@@ t line going through the Euro@@ z@@ one , which is th@@ re@@ aten@@ ing , mas@@ si@@ vely , the whole of the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on process .
We had an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity on the bas@@ is of the G@@ ree@@ k progra@@ m — which by the way , was the first progra@@ m to man@@ i@@ f@@ est that den@@ ial — to put it right .
And , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the po@@ w@@ ers in the Euro@@ z@@ one , in the Euro@@ gro@@ up , ch@@ ose to ma@@ in@@ tain den@@ ial .
But you know what happens .
This is the experience of the So@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on .
When you try to keep ali@@ ve an econo@@ mic system that ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ tur@@ ally cannot sur@@ vi@@ ve , through poli@@ tical will and through au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you may suc@@ ce@@ ed in pro@@ lon@@ ging it , but when change happens it happens very ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly and ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ally .
B@@ G : What kind of change are you for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ ing ?
Y@@ V : Well , there &apos;s no dou@@ b@@ t that if we don &apos;t change the ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ ture of the Euro@@ z@@ one , the Euro@@ z@@ one has no future .
B@@ G : D@@ id you make any mi@@ sta@@ kes when you were Fin@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ ter ?
Y@@ V : E@@ very day .
B@@ G : For example ? Y@@ V : An@@ y@@ body who loo@@ ks back — ( Applause ) No , but seri@@ ously .
If there &apos;s any M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of Fin@@ ance , or of anything else for that matter , who te@@ lls you after six months in a job , especi@@ ally in such a st@@ res@@ s@@ ful situ@@ ation , that they have made no mi@@ sta@@ ke , they &apos;re dan@@ ger@@ ous people .
O@@ f course I made mi@@ sta@@ kes .
The gre@@ at@@ est mi@@ sta@@ ke was to si@@ g@@ n the ap@@ pli@@ cation for the ex@@ ten@@ sion of a lo@@ an ag@@ ree@@ ment in the end of F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary .
And there was@@ n &apos;t .
They were simply interes@@ ted in cr@@ us@@ hing our government , just because they did not want to have to de@@ al with the ar@@ chi@@ tec@@ tural fa@@ ul@@ t lin@@ es that were run@@ ning through the Euro@@ z@@ one .
And because they didn &apos;t want to ad@@ mi@@ t that for five years they were imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phi@@ c progra@@ m in Gre@@ ece .
We lost on@@ e@@ -@@ th@@ ird of our no@@ min@@ al G@@ D@@ P .
This is wor@@ se than the Gre@@ at De@@ pres@@ sion .
And no one has come c@@ le@@ an from the tro@@ i@@ k@@ a of len@@ ders that have been im@@ pos@@ ing this poli@@ cy to say , &quot; &quot; This was a co@@ lo@@ s@@ sa@@ l mi@@ sta@@ ke . &quot; &quot; B@@ G : Des@@ pi@@ te all this , and des@@ pi@@ te the ag@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion , you see@@ m to be rema@@ in@@ ing quite pro@@ -@@ Euro@@ pe@@ an .
Y@@ V : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely .
L@@ oo@@ k , my cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m of the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on and the Euro@@ z@@ one comes from a person who lives and bre@@ a@@ th@@ es Europe .
My gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar is that the Euro@@ z@@ one will not sur@@ vi@@ ve .
Because if it doesn &apos;t , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces that will be un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed will be de@@ mon@@ ic , and they will dest@@ ro@@ y the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on .
And that will be ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phi@@ c not just for Europe but for the whole global econo@@ my .
We are probably the lar@@ g@@ est econo@@ my in the world .
And if we al@@ low ourselves to f@@ all into a rou@@ te of the pos@@ t@@ moder@@ n 19@@ 30 &apos;s , which see@@ ms to me to be what we are doing , then that will be de@@ tri@@ mental to the future of Euro@@ pe@@ ans and n@@ on-@@ Euro@@ pe@@ ans ali@@ ke .

G@@ abri@@ el G@@ ar@@ c@@ ía M@@ ár@@ que@@ z is one of my fav@@ ori@@ te wri@@ ters , for his stor@@ y@@ telling , but even more , I think , for the be@@ au@@ ty and preci@@ sion of his pro@@ se .
And whether it &apos;s the op@@ en@@ ing line from &quot; &quot; One H@@ un@@ dre@@ d Y@@ ear@@ s of So@@ li@@ tu@@ de &quot; &quot; or the fan@@ ta@@ sti@@ cal stre@@ am of consci@@ ousness in &quot; &quot; Au@@ tu@@ m@@ n of the P@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , &quot; &quot; where the words r@@ us@@ h by , pa@@ ge after pa@@ ge of un@@ pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ated imag@@ er@@ y s@@ wee@@ ping the read@@ er al@@ ong like some w@@ il@@ d ri@@ ver tw@@ ist@@ ing through a pri@@ mal S@@ outh Ameri@@ can j@@ un@@ g@@ le , read@@ ing M@@ ár@@ que@@ z is a vis@@ cer@@ al experience .
Wh@@ ich struc@@ k me as partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly re@@ mar@@ k@@ able dur@@ ing one s@@ es@@ sion with the no@@ vel when I realiz@@ ed that I was being s@@ we@@ pt al@@ ong on this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able , vi@@ vi@@ d j@@ our@@ ne@@ y in trans@@ lation .
Now I was a compar@@ a@@ tive liter@@ ature ma@@ j@@ or in colle@@ ge , which is like an English ma@@ j@@ or , only instead of being st@@ uc@@ k stud@@ ying C@@ ha@@ uc@@ er for three months , we got to read great liter@@ ature in trans@@ lation from around the world .
And as great as these bo@@ o@@ ks were , you could always tell that you were getting clo@@ se to the full effec@@ t .
But not so with M@@ ár@@ que@@ z who on@@ ce pra@@ i@@ sed his trans@@ la@@ tor &apos;s versi@@ ons as being better than his own , which is an a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ hing comp@@ li@@ ment .
So when I heard that the trans@@ la@@ tor , Gre@@ g@@ ory R@@ ab@@ as@@ sa , had wri@@ t@@ ten his own book on the sub@@ ject , I coul@@ dn &apos;t wa@@ it to read it .
It &apos;s called a@@ pro@@ pos of the I@@ t@@ ali@@ an ada@@ ge that I li@@ f@@ ted from his for@@ ward , &quot; If This B@@ e T@@ reason . &quot;
And it &apos;s a char@@ ming read .
It &apos;s high@@ ly re@@ com@@ men@@ ded for any@@ one who &apos;s interes@@ ted in the trans@@ la@@ tor &apos;s art .
But the reason that I men@@ tion it is that early on , R@@ ab@@ as@@ sa of@@ fer@@ s this ele@@ g@@ an@@ tly simple in@@ si@@ ght : &quot; &quot; E@@ very ac@@ t of communi@@ cation is an ac@@ t of trans@@ lation . &quot; &quot; Now maybe that &apos;s been obvi@@ ous to all of you for a long time , but for me , as of@@ ten as I &apos;d en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed that exac@@ t dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty on a da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is , I had never seen the in@@ her@@ ent ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge of communi@@ cation in so cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ line a light .
E@@ ver sin@@ ce I can remember thinking consci@@ ously about such things , communi@@ cation has been my cent@@ ral pas@@ sion .
E@@ ven as a child , I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communi@@ cate it to everyone else .
So no e@@ go problems .
It &apos;s fun@@ ny , my wi@@ fe , D@@ a@@ is@@ y , wh@@ ose family is li@@ tter@@ ed with sch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic@@ s — and I mean li@@ tter@@ ed with them — on@@ ce said to me , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ r@@ is , I already have a bro@@ ther who thin@@ ks he &apos;s God .
I don &apos;t need a h@@ us@@ b@@ and who wan@@ ts to be . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , as I pl@@ un@@ ged through my 20@@ s ever more aw@@ are of how un@@ ob@@ tain@@ able the first part of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od ambi@@ tion was , it was that second part , being able to suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly communi@@ cate to others w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge I was ga@@ in@@ ing , where the fu@@ tili@@ ty of my qu@@ est really set in .
Ti@@ me after time , wh@@ en@@ ever I set out to share some great tru@@ th with a so@@ on-@@ to@@ -@@ be gra@@ te@@ ful reci@@ pi@@ ent , it had the op@@ posi@@ te effec@@ t .
Inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , when your op@@ en@@ ing line of communi@@ cation is , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , li@@ ste@@ n up , because I &apos;m about to dro@@ p some seri@@ ous kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge on you , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing how qu@@ ick@@ ly you &apos;ll disco@@ ver both ice and the fir@@ ing s@@ qu@@ ad .
Fin@@ ally , after about 10 years of ali@@ en@@ ating fri@@ ends and st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers ali@@ ke , I finally got it , a new person@@ al tru@@ th all my own , that if I was going to ever communi@@ cate well with other people the ideas that I was ga@@ in@@ ing , I &apos;d better find a different way of going about it .
And that &apos;s when I disco@@ vered come@@ dy .
Now come@@ dy tra@@ vel@@ s al@@ ong a dist@@ inc@@ t wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th from other for@@ ms of language .
If I had to place it on an ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary spec@@ tru@@ m , I &apos;d say it fal@@ ls some@@ where between poe@@ try and li@@ es .
And I &apos;m not talking about all come@@ dy here , because , c@@ lear@@ ly , there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of hu@@ mor that col@@ ors sa@@ fe@@ ly within the lin@@ es of what we already think and feel .
What I want to talk about is the uni@@ que ability that the best come@@ dy and sa@@ ti@@ re has at cir@@ cu@@ m@@ v@@ ent@@ ing our ing@@ ra@@ in@@ ed per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ es — come@@ dy as the phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er &apos;s st@@ one .
It takes the base me@@ tal of our conven@@ tional wis@@ dom and trans@@ for@@ ms it through ri@@ di@@ cu@@ le into a different way of see@@ ing and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely being in the world .
Because that &apos;s what I take from the the@@ me of this con@@ fer@@ ence : G@@ a@@ in@@ ed in T@@ ran@@ s@@ lation .
That it &apos;s about communi@@ cation that doesn &apos;t just produ@@ ce gre@@ ater underst@@ an@@ ding within the individu@@ al , but le@@ ads to real change .
Wh@@ ich in my experience means communi@@ cation that man@@ ages to spe@@ ak to and ex@@ p@@ and our concep@@ t of sel@@ f-@@ inter@@ est .
Now I &apos;m big on spe@@ a@@ king to people &apos;s sel@@ f-@@ inter@@ est because we &apos;re all wi@@ red for that .
It &apos;s part of our sur@@ viv@@ al p@@ ac@@ k@@ age , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s become so important for us , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re always listen@@ ing at that level .
And also because that &apos;s where , in ter@@ ms of our own sel@@ f-@@ inter@@ est , we finally beg@@ in to gra@@ s@@ p our ability to respon@@ d , our respon@@ si@@ bility to the res@@ t of the world .
Now as to what I mean by the best come@@ dy and sa@@ ti@@ re , I mean work that comes first and fo@@ re@@ most from a place of hon@@ est@@ y and inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty .
Now if you think back on T@@ ina F@@ ey &apos;s im@@ person@@ ations on S@@ atur@@ day N@@ ight Li@@ ve of the ne@@ w@@ ly no@@ min@@ ated vi@@ ce pres@@ identi@@ al can@@ di@@ da@@ te S@@ ar@@ ah P@@ al@@ in , they were de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting .
F@@ ey de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted far more effec@@ tively than any poli@@ tical pun@@ di@@ t the can@@ di@@ da@@ te &apos;s funda@@ mental lack of seri@@ ousness , ce@@ men@@ ting an imp@@ res@@ sion that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the Ameri@@ can publi@@ c still h@@ ol@@ ds today .
And the k@@ ey de@@ ta@@ il of this is that F@@ ey &apos;s s@@ cri@@ p@@ ts wer@@ en &apos;t wri@@ t@@ ten by her and they wer@@ en &apos;t wri@@ t@@ ten by the S@@ N@@ L wri@@ ters .
They were li@@ f@@ ted ver@@ ba@@ ti@@ m from P@@ al@@ in &apos;s own re@@ mar@@ ks .
( Laughter ) Here was a P@@ al@@ in im@@ person@@ at@@ or quot@@ ing P@@ al@@ in word for word .
Now that &apos;s hon@@ est@@ y and inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty , and it &apos;s also why F@@ ey &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ces left such a la@@ st@@ ing imp@@ res@@ sion .
O@@ n the other side of the poli@@ tical spec@@ tru@@ m , the first time that I heard R@@ us@@ h L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh ref@@ er to pres@@ identi@@ al ho@@ pe@@ ful Jo@@ h@@ n E@@ d@@ war@@ ds as the B@@ rec@@ k gir@@ l I knew that he &apos;d made a direc@@ t h@@ it .
Now it &apos;s not of@@ ten that I &apos;m going to as@@ soci@@ ate the words hon@@ est@@ y and inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty with L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh , but it &apos;s really hard to ar@@ gue with that pun@@ ch@@ line .
The descri@@ p@@ tion perfec@@ tly cap@@ tu@@ red E@@ d@@ war@@ ds &apos; person@@ al van@@ ity .
And gu@@ ess what ?
That en@@ ded up being the exac@@ t person@@ ality tra@@ it that was at the co@@ re of the s@@ can@@ da@@ l that en@@ ded his poli@@ tical car@@ e@@ er .
Now The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how with Jo@@ h@@ n Ste@@ war@@ t is by far the most — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) it &apos;s by far the most w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted example of the effec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess of this kind of come@@ dy .
S@@ ur@@ ve@@ y after sur@@ ve@@ y , from Pe@@ w R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch to the An@@ nen@@ ber@@ g C@@ en@@ ter for P@@ u@@ bli@@ c Po@@ li@@ cy , has found that D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how vie@@ w@@ ers are better in@@ for@@ med about cur@@ r@@ ent ev@@ ents than the vie@@ w@@ ers of all ma@@ j@@ or ne@@ t@@ work and ca@@ ble news sho@@ ws .
( Applause ) Now whether this says more about the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t between inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty and pro@@ fi@@ ta@@ bility of cor@@ po@@ rate j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ism than it does about the atten@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess of Ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s vie@@ w@@ ers , the lar@@ ger point rema@@ ins that Ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s material is always gro@@ un@@ ded in a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to the fac@@ ts — not because his in@@ t@@ ent is to in@@ form . It &apos;s not .
H@@ is in@@ t@@ ent is to be fun@@ ny .
It just so happens that Ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s br@@ and of fun@@ ny doesn &apos;t work un@@ less the fac@@ ts are true .
And the resul@@ t is great come@@ dy that &apos;s also an information de@@ li@@ very system that s@@ cor@@ es mar@@ ke@@ d@@ ly high@@ er in both cre@@ di@@ bility and re@@ ten@@ tion than the profes@@ sion@@ al news media .
Now this is dou@@ bly i@@ ro@@ ni@@ c when you consi@@ der that what gi@@ ves come@@ dy its e@@ dge at re@@ ach@@ ing around people &apos;s wal@@ ls is the way that it us@@ es de@@ liber@@ ate mis@@ direc@@ tion .
A great piece of come@@ dy is a ver@@ b@@ al ma@@ gi@@ c tri@@ ck , where you think it &apos;s going over here and then all of a su@@ d@@ den you &apos;re trans@@ por@@ ted over here .
And there &apos;s this mental de@@ light that &apos;s fol@@ low@@ ed by the physical respon@@ se of la@@ u@@ ghter , which , not co@@ inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , re@@ le@@ ases en@@ d@@ or@@ ph@@ ins in the brain .
And just like that , you &apos;ve been se@@ duc@@ ed into a different way of looking at something because the en@@ d@@ or@@ ph@@ ins have b@@ rou@@ ght down your defen@@ ses .
This is the exac@@ t op@@ posi@@ te of the way that an@@ ger and fe@@ ar and p@@ ani@@ c , all of the fli@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ fi@@ ght respon@@ ses , oper@@ ate .
F@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ fi@@ ght re@@ le@@ ases ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in , which th@@ ro@@ ws our wal@@ ls up sk@@ y@@ -@@ high .
And the come@@ dy comes al@@ ong , de@@ al@@ ing with a lot of the same are@@ as where our defen@@ ses are the st@@ ron@@ g@@ est — race , reli@@ gi@@ on , poli@@ tics , se@@ xu@@ ality — only by appro@@ ach@@ ing them through hu@@ mor instead of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in , we get en@@ d@@ or@@ ph@@ ins and the al@@ che@@ my of la@@ u@@ ghter tur@@ ns our wal@@ ls into win@@ do@@ ws , re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing a f@@ res@@ h and un@@ expec@@ ted point of vie@@ w .
Now let me give you an example from my ac@@ t .
I have some material about the so@@ -@@ called radi@@ cal ga@@ y ag@@ en@@ da , which star@@ ts off by as@@ king , how radi@@ cal is the ga@@ y ag@@ en@@ da ?
Because from what I can tell , the three things ga@@ y Amer@@ ic@@ ans see@@ m to want most are to jo@@ in the mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y , get mar@@ ri@@ ed and start a family .
( Laughter ) Th@@ ree things I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to a@@ vo@@ id my entire life . ( Laughter )
Ha@@ ve at it you radi@@ cal ba@@ star@@ ds . The fiel@@ d is your@@ s . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s fol@@ low@@ ed by these lin@@ es about ga@@ y ado@@ p@@ tion : What is the problem with ga@@ y ado@@ p@@ tion ?
Why is this re@@ mo@@ tely contro@@ versi@@ al ?
If you have a bab@@ y and you think that bab@@ y &apos;s ga@@ y , you should be al@@ low@@ ed to put it up for ado@@ p@@ tion .
( Laughter ) You have given bir@@ th to an ab@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
Re@@ move it from your h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old .
Now by taking the bi@@ bli@@ cal e@@ pi@@ the@@ t &quot; &quot; ab@@ o@@ min@@ ation &quot; &quot; and at@@ ta@@ ching it to the ul@@ ti@@ mate ima@@ ge of in@@ no@@ cen@@ ce , a bab@@ y , this jo@@ ke sh@@ or@@ t cir@@ cu@@ its the emo@@ tional w@@ ir@@ ing be@@ hind the de@@ ba@@ te and it lea@@ ves the audi@@ ence with the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity , through their la@@ u@@ ghter , to question its v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty .
M@@ is@@ direc@@ tion isn &apos;t the only tri@@ ck that come@@ dy has up its s@@ le@@ e@@ ve .
E@@ co@@ no@@ my of language is another real st@@ rong su@@ it of great come@@ dy .
There are few ph@@ ra@@ ses that p@@ ack a more con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted dose of sub@@ ject and sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l than the perfec@@ t pun@@ ch@@ line .
B@@ ill H@@ ic@@ ks — and if you don &apos;t know his work , you should really Goog@@ le him — H@@ ic@@ ks had a rou@@ t@@ ine about getting into one of those chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od bra@@ gg@@ ing cont@@ est@@ s on the play@@ ground , where finally the other kid says to him , &quot; H@@ u@@ h ? Well my da@@ d can be@@ at up your da@@ d , &quot; to which H@@ ic@@ ks re@@ pli@@ es , &quot; Re@@ ally ? How so@@ on ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s an entire chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od in three words . ( Laughter )
No@@ t to men@@ tion what it re@@ ve@@ als about the adul@@ t who &apos;s spe@@ a@@ king them .
And one last power@@ ful at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te that come@@ dy has as communi@@ cation is that it &apos;s in@@ her@@ ently vi@@ ral .
People can &apos;t wa@@ it to pas@@ s al@@ ong that new great jo@@ ke .
And this isn &apos;t some new ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on of our wi@@ red world .
Co@@ me@@ dy has been cro@@ s@@ sing country with re@@ mar@@ k@@ able spe@@ ed way before the Internet , social media , even ca@@ ble T@@ V .
B@@ ack in 19@@ 80 when co@@ medi@@ an R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard P@@ r@@ y@@ or ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally set hi@@ m@@ self on fire dur@@ ing a f@@ ree@@ bas@@ ing ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent , I was in L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles the day after it happened and then I was in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . two days after that .
And I heard the exac@@ t same pun@@ ch@@ line on both co@@ a@@ sts — something about the I@@ gni@@ ted Ne@@ gr@@ o C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge F@@ und .
C@@ lear@@ ly , it didn &apos;t come out of a T@@ on@@ ight S@@ how mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gue .
And my gu@@ ess here — and I have no research on this — is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it , you &apos;d find out that come@@ dy is the second ol@@ des@@ t vi@@ ral profes@@ sion .
F@@ ir@@ st there were dru@@ ms and then kno@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ kno@@ ck jo@@ kes .
( Laughter ) But it &apos;s when you put all of these ele@@ ments together — when you get the vi@@ ral ap@@ pe@@ al of a great jo@@ ke with a power@@ ful pun@@ ch@@ line that &apos;s cra@@ f@@ ted from hon@@ est@@ y and inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty , it can have a real world impac@@ t at chan@@ ging a conversa@@ tion .
Now I have a clo@@ se fri@@ end , Jo@@ el Pe@@ t@@ t , who &apos;s the edi@@ tori@@ al carto@@ on@@ ist for the L@@ ex@@ ing@@ ton H@@ er@@ al@@ d-@@ Le@@ ad@@ er .
And he used to be the U@@ S@@ A To@@ day M@@ on@@ day mor@@ ning guy .
I was visi@@ ting with Jo@@ el the wee@@ k@@ end before the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen con@@ fer@@ ence on climate change op@@ en@@ ed in D@@ ec@@ e@@ mber of 200@@ 9 .
And Jo@@ el was ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing to me that , because U@@ S@@ A To@@ day was one of America &apos;s four pa@@ per@@ s of recor@@ d , it would be s@@ can@@ ned by vir@@ tu@@ ally everyone in atten@@ d@@ ance at the con@@ fer@@ ence , which me@@ ant that , if he h@@ it it out of the par@@ k with his carto@@ on on M@@ on@@ day , the op@@ en@@ ing day of the con@@ fer@@ ence , it could get pas@@ sed around at the high@@ est level a@@ mon@@ g actual deci@@ sion@@ -@@ ma@@ kers .
So we started talking about climate change .
And it tur@@ ned out that Jo@@ el and I were both bo@@ ther@@ ed by the same thing , which was how so much of the de@@ ba@@ te was still fo@@ cu@@ sed on the science and how comple@@ te it was or was@@ n &apos;t , which , to both of us , see@@ ms some@@ what inten@@ tion@@ ally off point .
Because first of all , there &apos;s this fal@@ se pre@@ mi@@ se that such a thing as comple@@ te science exist@@ s .
Now G@@ o@@ vern@@ or Per@@ ry of my ne@@ w@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ ado@@ p@@ ted sta@@ te of T@@ ex@@ as was p@@ us@@ hing this same line this pa@@ st su@@ mm@@ er at the beg@@ in@@ ning of his o@@ op@@ s@@ -@@ fa@@ ted cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n for the Re@@ publi@@ can pres@@ identi@@ al no@@ min@@ ation , pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ing over and over that the science was@@ n &apos;t comple@@ te at the same time that 2@@ 50 out of 2@@ 5@@ 4 coun@@ ties in the sta@@ te of T@@ ex@@ as were on fire .
And Per@@ ry &apos;s poli@@ cy solu@@ tion was to ask the people of T@@ ex@@ as to pra@@ y for ra@@ in .
Per@@ son@@ ally , I was pra@@ ying for four more fir@@ es so we could finally comple@@ te the da@@ m@@ n science .
( Laughter ) But back in 200@@ 9 , the question Jo@@ el and I ke@@ pt tur@@ ning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being sp@@ ent talking about the science when the poli@@ ci@@ es neces@@ s@@ ary to ad@@ d@@ ress climate change were un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally ben@@ efici@@ al for human@@ ity in the long r@@ un re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the science .
So we to@@ s@@ sed it back and for@@ th until Jo@@ el came up with this .
Car@@ to@@ on : &quot; &quot; What if it &apos;s a big ho@@ a@@ x and we create a better world for nothing ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
( Applause ) How about that ? How about we create a better world for nothing ?
No@@ t for God , not for country , not for prof@@ it — just as a ba@@ sic me@@ tri@@ c for global deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making .
And this carto@@ on h@@ it the bul@@ l &apos;s ey@@ e .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the con@@ fer@@ ence was over , Jo@@ el got a re@@ qu@@ est for a si@@ g@@ ned co@@ p@@ y from the head of the E@@ P@@ A in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton wh@@ ose w@@ all it now han@@ gs on .
And not long after that , he got another re@@ qu@@ est for a co@@ p@@ y from the head of the E@@ P@@ A in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a who used it as part of her pres@@ en@@ tation at an inter@@ national con@@ fer@@ ence on climate change in S@@ ac@@ ra@@ mento last year .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
To da@@ te , Jo@@ el &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten re@@ qu@@ est@@ s from over 40 environ@@ mental g@@ rou@@ ps , in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , Can@@ ada and Europe .
And ear@@ li@@ er this year , he got a re@@ qu@@ est from the Gre@@ en Par@@ ty in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a who used it in their cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n where it became part of the de@@ ba@@ te that resul@@ ted in the Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an par@@ li@@ a@@ ment ado@@ p@@ ting the most ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous car@@ b@@ on ta@@ x re@@ gi@@ me of any country in the world .
( Applause ) That is a lot of pun@@ ch for 1@@ 4 words .
So my su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion to those of you out here who are seri@@ ously fo@@ cu@@ sed on cre@@ ating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and prac@@ tice thinking fun@@ ny , because you might just find the question that you &apos;ve been looking for .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i , my name is Fran@@ k , and I col@@ lec@@ t se@@ cre@@ ts .
It all started with a cra@@ z@@ y idea in No@@ ve@@ mber of 200@@ 4 .
I pr@@ in@@ ted up 3@@ ,000 sel@@ f-@@ ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , just like this .
They were b@@ lan@@ k on one side , and on the other side I li@@ s@@ ted some simple in@@ struc@@ tions .
I asked people to an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ously share an ar@@ t@@ ful se@@ cre@@ t they &apos;d never told any@@ one before .
And I han@@ ded out these pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly on the st@@ ree@@ ts of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , not kno@@ wing what to expec@@ t .
But so@@ on the idea beg@@ an s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing vir@@ ally .
People beg@@ an to bu@@ y their own pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds and make their own pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds .
I started rece@@ i@@ ving se@@ cre@@ ts in my home ma@@ il@@ bo@@ x , not just with pos@@ t@@ mar@@ ks from W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , but from T@@ ex@@ as , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver , Ne@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , I@@ ra@@ q .
So@@ on my cra@@ z@@ y idea didn &apos;t see@@ m so cra@@ z@@ y .
Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ .@@ co@@ m is the most visi@@ ted ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment@@ -@@ f@@ ree blo@@ g in the world .
And this is my pos@@ t@@ car@@ d col@@ lec@@ tion today .
You can see my wi@@ fe stru@@ gg@@ ling to sta@@ ck a bri@@ ck of pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds on a p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d of over a hal@@ f-@@ million se@@ cre@@ ts .
What I &apos;d like to do now is share with you a very spe@@ cial han@@ d@@ ful of se@@ cre@@ ts from that col@@ lec@@ tion , star@@ ting with this one .
&quot; &quot; I found these sta@@ mp@@ s as a child , and I have been wa@@ it@@ ing all my life to have someone to sen@@ d them to .
I never did have someone . &quot; &quot; S@@ ec@@ re@@ ts can take many for@@ ms .
They can be sho@@ c@@ king or si@@ l@@ ly or s@@ oul@@ ful .
They can connec@@ t us to our de@@ e@@ p@@ est human@@ ity or with people we &apos;ll never me@@ et .
( Laughter ) Ma@@ ybe one of you s@@ ent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
This one does a great job of de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ting the crea@@ tivi@@ ty that people have when they make and mai@@ l me a pos@@ t@@ car@@ d .
This one obvi@@ ously was made out of half a S@@ tar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks cu@@ p with a sta@@ m@@ p and my home ad@@ d@@ ress wri@@ t@@ ten on the other side .
&quot; &quot; De@@ ar B@@ ir@@ th@@ mother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happ@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ ec@@ re@@ ts can re@@ mind us of the coun@@ t@@ less human dra@@ mas , of fra@@ il@@ ty and her@@ o@@ ism , pla@@ ying out si@@ l@@ ently in the lives of people all around us even now .
&quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ one who knew me before 9 / 1@@ 1 belie@@ ves I &apos;m de@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I used to work with a bun@@ ch of u@@ p@@ ti@@ ght reli@@ gi@@ ous people , so sometimes I didn &apos;t we@@ ar p@@ anti@@ es , and just had a big s@@ mi@@ le and ch@@ uc@@ k@@ led to myself . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This next one takes a little ex@@ plan@@ ation before I share it with you .
I love to spe@@ ak on colle@@ ge camp@@ us@@ es and share se@@ cre@@ ts and the stories with stud@@ ents .
And sometimes af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds I &apos;ll stic@@ k around and si@@ g@@ n bo@@ o@@ ks and take phot@@ os with stud@@ ents .
And this next pos@@ t@@ car@@ d was made out of one of those phot@@ os .
And I should also men@@ tion that , just like today , at that Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t ev@@ ent , I was using a wi@@ re@@ less micro@@ ph@@ one .
&quot; &quot; Y@@ our mic was@@ n &apos;t off dur@@ ing sound ch@@ ec@@ k .
We all heard you pe@@ e . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was really e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ sing when it happened , until I realiz@@ ed it could have been wor@@ se .
R@@ ight . You know what I &apos;m saying .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; In@@ side this en@@ velo@@ pe is the ri@@ p@@ ped up rema@@ ins of a su@@ i@@ ci@@ de n@@ ote I didn &apos;t use .
I feel like the hap@@ pi@@ est person on Earth ( now . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One of these men is the fa@@ ther of my son .
He pa@@ ys me a lot to keep it a se@@ cre@@ t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; That S@@ atur@@ day when you wonder@@ ed where I was , well , I was getting your r@@ ing .
It &apos;s in my po@@ c@@ ket right now . &quot; &quot; I had this pos@@ t@@ car@@ d pos@@ ted on the Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t blo@@ g two years ago on V@@ al@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s D@@ ay .
It was the very bot@@ to@@ m , the last se@@ cre@@ t in the long co@@ lu@@ m@@ n .
And it ha@@ dn &apos;t been up for more than a cou@@ ple h@@ our@@ s before I rece@@ i@@ ved this ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant e@@ mai@@ l from the guy who mai@@ led me this pos@@ t@@ car@@ d .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Fran@@ k , I &apos;ve got to share with you this story that just play@@ ed out in my life . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; My k@@ ne@@ es are still s@@ ha@@ king . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; For three years , my gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end and I , we &apos;ve made it this S@@ un@@ day mor@@ ning ri@@ tual to visi@@ t the Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t blo@@ g together and read the se@@ cre@@ ts out l@@ ou@@ d .
I read some to her , she read@@ s some to me . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really b@@ rou@@ ght us clo@@ ser together through the years .
And so when I disco@@ vered that you had pos@@ ted my sur@@ pri@@ se pro@@ pos@@ al to my gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end at the very bot@@ to@@ m , I was b@@ esi@@ de myself .
And I tri@@ ed to ac@@ t cal@@ m , not to give anything away .
And just like every S@@ un@@ day , we started read@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ ts out l@@ ou@@ d to each other . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But this time it see@@ med like it was taking her fo@@ re@@ ver to get through each one . &quot; &quot; But she finally did .
She got to that bot@@ to@@ m se@@ cre@@ t , his pro@@ pos@@ al to her .
And he said , &quot; &quot; She read it on@@ ce and then she read it again . &quot; &quot; And she tur@@ ned to him and said , &quot; I@@ s that our c@@ at ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And when she saw him , he was down on one k@@ ne@@ e , he had the r@@ ing out .
He po@@ p@@ ped the question , she said y@@ es . It was a very happ@@ y en@@ ding .
So I e@@ mai@@ led him back and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase share with me an ima@@ ge , something , that I can share with the whole Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t commun@@ ity and let everyone know your fa@@ ir@@ y tal@@ e en@@ ding . &quot; &quot; And he e@@ mai@@ led me this picture .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I found your cam@@ era at L@@ ol@@ la@@ pal@@ oo@@ za this su@@ mm@@ er .
I finally got the pic@@ tures developed and I &apos;d love to give them to you . &quot; &quot; This picture never got re@@ tur@@ ned back to the people who lost it , but this se@@ cre@@ t has impac@@ ted many lives , star@@ ting with a stud@@ ent up in Can@@ ada na@@ med M@@ at@@ ty .
M@@ at@@ ty was in@@ spi@@ red by that se@@ cre@@ t to start his own we@@ b@@ si@@ te , a we@@ b@@ si@@ te called I@@ Fo@@ und@@ Y@@ our@@ C@@ am@@ era .
M@@ at@@ ty invi@@ tes people to mai@@ l him di@@ gi@@ tal ca@@ mer@@ as that they &apos;ve found , memor@@ y stic@@ ks that have been lost with or@@ p@@ ha@@ n phot@@ os .
And M@@ at@@ ty takes the pic@@ tures off these ca@@ mer@@ as and pos@@ ts them on his we@@ b@@ si@@ te every wee@@ k .
And people come to visi@@ t to see if they can identi@@ f@@ y a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the phot@@ os back to them that they might be des@@ per@@ ately se@@ ar@@ ching for .
This one &apos;s my fav@@ ori@@ te .
( Laughter ) M@@ at@@ ty has found this ing@@ en@@ i@@ ous way to le@@ ver@@ age the kin@@ d@@ ness of st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers .
And it might see@@ m like a simple idea , and it is , but the impac@@ t it can have on people &apos;s lives can be hu@@ ge .
M@@ at@@ ty shar@@ ed with me an emo@@ tional e@@ mai@@ l he rece@@ i@@ ved from the mother in that picture .
&quot; &quot; That &apos;s me , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and son .
The other pic@@ tures are of my very ill gran@@ d@@ mother .
Thank you for making your si@@ te .
These pic@@ tures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s bir@@ th is on this cam@@ era .
He tur@@ ns four to@@ mor@@ row . &quot; &quot; E@@ very picture that you see there and thousands of others have been re@@ tur@@ ned back to the person who lost it — sometimes cro@@ s@@ sing oce@@ ans , sometimes going through language bar@@ ri@@ ers .
This is the last pos@@ t@@ car@@ d I have to share with you today .
&quot; &quot; When people I love lea@@ ve vo@@ ic@@ e@@ ma@@ il@@ s on my ph@@ one I always sa@@ ve them in case they di@@ e to@@ mor@@ row and I have no other way of hear@@ ing their vo@@ ice ever again . &quot; &quot; When I pos@@ ted this se@@ cre@@ t , do@@ z@@ ens of people s@@ ent vo@@ ic@@ e@@ mai@@ l mes@@ sa@@ ges from their ph@@ ones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been ke@@ e@@ ping for years , mes@@ sa@@ ges from family or fri@@ ends who had died .
They said that by pres@@ er@@ ving those vo@@ ic@@ es and shar@@ ing them , it hel@@ ped them keep the spi@@ ri@@ t of their lo@@ ved ones ali@@ ve .
One young gir@@ l pos@@ ted the last mes@@ sa@@ ge she ever heard from her gran@@ d@@ mother .
S@@ ec@@ re@@ ts can take many for@@ ms .
They can be sho@@ c@@ king or si@@ l@@ ly or s@@ oul@@ ful .
They can connec@@ t us with our de@@ e@@ p@@ est human@@ ity or with people we &apos;ll never me@@ et again .
V@@ o@@ ic@@ e@@ mai@@ l recor@@ ding : F@@ ir@@ st sa@@ ved vo@@ ice mes@@ sa@@ ge .
G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma : ♫ It &apos;s somebody &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day today ♫ ♫ So@@ me@@ body &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day today ♫ ♫ The can@@ d@@ les are li@@ gh@@ ted ♫ ♫ on somebody &apos;s ca@@ ke ♫ ♫ And we &apos;re all invi@@ ted ♫ ♫ for somebody &apos;s sa@@ ke ♫ You &apos;re 2@@ 1 years old today .
Ha@@ ve a real happ@@ y bir@@ th@@ day , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say b@@ y@@ e for now .
F@@ W : Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
J@@ un@@ e Co@@ h@@ en : Fran@@ k , that was beautiful , so tou@@ ching .
Ha@@ ve you ever s@@ ent yourself a pos@@ t@@ car@@ d ?
Ha@@ ve you ever s@@ ent in a se@@ cre@@ t to Po@@ st@@ S@@ ec@@ re@@ t ?
F@@ W : I have one of my own se@@ cre@@ ts in every book .
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because I was stru@@ gg@@ ling with my own se@@ cre@@ ts .
And it was through cro@@ w@@ d-@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing , it was through the kin@@ d@@ ness that st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers were sho@@ wing me , that I could un@@ co@@ ver par@@ ts of my pa@@ st that were ha@@ un@@ ting me .
J@@ C : And has any@@ one ever disco@@ vered which se@@ cre@@ t was your@@ s in the book ?
H@@ as any@@ one in your life been able to tell ?
F@@ W : So@@ me@@ times I share that information , ye@@ ah .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
When I was 1@@ 4 years old , I was interes@@ ted in science — fas@@ cin@@ ated by it , exci@@ ted to learn about it .
And I had a high school science teach@@ er who would say to the cla@@ ss , &quot; The gir@@ ls don &apos;t have to li@@ ste@@ n to this . &quot;
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging , y@@ es .
( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose not to li@@ ste@@ n — but to that sta@@ te@@ ment al@@ one .
So let me take you to the An@@ des moun@@ ta@@ ins in C@@ hi@@ le , 5@@ 00 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters , 3@@ 00 miles nor@@ the@@ ast of S@@ anti@@ ago .
It &apos;s very re@@ m@@ ote , it &apos;s very dr@@ y and it &apos;s very beautiful .
And there &apos;s not much there .
There are con@@ d@@ ors , there are tar@@ an@@ t@@ ul@@ as , and at ni@@ ght , when the light di@@ ms , it re@@ ve@@ als one of the dar@@ k@@ est s@@ ki@@ es on Earth .
It &apos;s kind of a ma@@ gi@@ c place , the moun@@ tain .
It &apos;s a wonderful com@@ bin@@ ation of very re@@ m@@ ote moun@@ tain@@ top with ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted technology .
And our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , for as long as there &apos;s been recor@@ ded hist@@ ory , have looked at the ni@@ ght sk@@ y and pon@@ der@@ ed the n@@ ature of our exist@@ ence .
And we &apos;re no ex@@ cep@@ tion , our gener@@ ation .
The only dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty is that the ni@@ ght sk@@ y now is blo@@ c@@ ked by the g@@ l@@ are of city li@@ ghts .
And so a@@ st@@ ro@@ no@@ m@@ ers go to these very re@@ m@@ ote moun@@ tain@@ to@@ ps to vie@@ w and to study the co@@ s@@ mos .
So telesco@@ pes are our win@@ do@@ w to the co@@ s@@ mos .
It &apos;s no ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ e@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere is going to be the future of a@@ st@@ ro@@ no@@ my for the 2@@ 1@@ st cent@@ ur@@ y .
We have an arra@@ y of exist@@ ing telesco@@ pes already , in the An@@ des moun@@ ta@@ ins in C@@ hi@@ le , and that &apos;s so@@ on to be jo@@ in@@ ed by a really sen@@ sa@@ tional arra@@ y of new cap@@ ability .
There will be two inter@@ national g@@ rou@@ ps that are going to be buil@@ ding gi@@ ant telesco@@ pes , sen@@ si@@ tive to op@@ tical radi@@ ation , as our eyes are .
There will be a sur@@ ve@@ y telesco@@ pe that will be s@@ can@@ ning the sk@@ y every few ni@@ ghts .
There will be radi@@ o telesco@@ pes , sen@@ si@@ tive to lon@@ g@@ -@@ wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th radi@@ o radi@@ ation .
And then there will be telesco@@ pes in space .
There &apos;ll be a suc@@ ces@@ s@@ or to the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe ; it &apos;s called the J@@ a@@ mes W@@ e@@ b@@ b T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe , and it will be la@@ un@@ ched in 20@@ 1@@ 8 .
There &apos;ll be a sa@@ te@@ lli@@ te called TE@@ S@@ S that will disco@@ ver plane@@ ts out@@ side of our solar system .
For the last deca@@ de , I &apos;ve been le@@ ad@@ ing a gro@@ up — a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um — inter@@ national gro@@ up , to build what will be , when it &apos;s fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , the lar@@ g@@ est op@@ tical telesco@@ pe in exist@@ ence .
It &apos;s called the Gi@@ ant M@@ ag@@ el@@ lan T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe , or G@@ M@@ T .
This telesco@@ pe is going to have mir@@ r@@ ors that are 8@@ .@@ 4 me@@ ters in dia@@ me@@ ter — each of the mir@@ r@@ ors .
That &apos;s almost 2@@ 7 fe@@ et .
So it d@@ war@@ f@@ s this sta@@ ge — maybe out to the f@@ our@@ th row in this audi@@ ence .
E@@ ach of the se@@ ven mir@@ r@@ ors in this telesco@@ pe will be almost 2@@ 7 fe@@ et in dia@@ me@@ ter .
To@@ gether , the se@@ ven mir@@ r@@ ors in this telesco@@ pe will com@@ pri@@ se 80 fe@@ et in dia@@ me@@ ter .
So , es@@ senti@@ ally the size of this entire audi@@ tori@@ um .
The whole telesco@@ pe will st@@ and about 4@@ 3 me@@ ters high , and again , being in R@@ io , some of you have been to see the sta@@ tu@@ e of the gi@@ ant Ch@@ ri@@ st .
The s@@ cal@@ e is compar@@ able in he@@ ight ; in fact , it &apos;s s@@ mal@@ ler than this telesco@@ pe will be .
It &apos;s compar@@ able to the size of the Sta@@ tu@@ e of Li@@ ber@@ ty .
And it &apos;s going to be h@@ ou@@ sed in an en@@ clo@@ sure that &apos;s 2@@ 2 stories — 60 me@@ ters high .
But it &apos;s an un@@ us@@ u@@ al buil@@ ding to protec@@ t this telesco@@ pe .
It will have open win@@ do@@ ws to the sk@@ y , be able to point and look at the sk@@ y , and it will actually r@@ ot@@ ate on a base — 2@@ ,000 t@@ ons of r@@ ot@@ ating buil@@ ding .
The Gi@@ ant M@@ ag@@ el@@ lan T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe will have 10 times the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe .
It will be 20 million times more sen@@ si@@ tive than the human ey@@ e .
And it may , for the first time ever , be cap@@ able of fin@@ ding life on plane@@ ts out@@ side of our solar system .
It &apos;s going to al@@ low us to look back at the first light in the universe — liter@@ ally , the da@@ wn of the co@@ s@@ mos .
The co@@ s@@ mic da@@ wn .
It &apos;s a telesco@@ pe that &apos;s going to al@@ low us to pe@@ er back , w@@ it@@ ness gal@@ axi@@ es as they were when they were actually as@@ se@@ mb@@ ling , the first black h@@ ol@@ es in the universe , the first gal@@ axi@@ es .
Now , for thousands of years , we have been stud@@ ying the co@@ s@@ mos , we &apos;ve been wonder@@ ing about our place in the universe .
The an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ ree@@ ks told us that the Earth was the cen@@ ter of the universe .
F@@ i@@ ve hundre@@ d years ago , Co@@ per@@ n@@ ic@@ us dis@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed the Earth , and put the S@@ un at the heart of the co@@ s@@ mos .
And as we &apos;ve learned over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es , sin@@ ce G@@ ali@@ leo G@@ ali@@ le@@ i , the I@@ t@@ ali@@ an scienti@@ st , first tur@@ ned , in that time , a tw@@ o@@ -@@ in@@ ch , very small telesco@@ pe , to the sk@@ y , every time we have buil@@ t lar@@ ger telesco@@ pes , we have learned something about the universe ; we &apos;ve made disco@@ ver@@ ies , without ex@@ cep@@ tion .
We &apos;ve learned in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y that the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding and that our own solar system is not at the cen@@ ter of that ex@@ pan@@ sion .
We know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion gal@@ axi@@ es that are vi@@ sible to us , and each one of those gal@@ axi@@ es has 100 billion star@@ s within it .
So we &apos;re looking now at the de@@ e@@ p@@ est ima@@ ge of the co@@ s@@ mos that &apos;s ever been ta@@ ken .
It was ta@@ ken using the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe , and by po@@ in@@ ting the telesco@@ pe at what was pre@@ vi@@ ously a b@@ lan@@ k re@@ gi@@ on of sk@@ y , before the la@@ un@@ ch of H@@ u@@ b@@ ble .
And if you can imagine this tin@@ y are@@ a , it &apos;s only on@@ e@@ -@@ fi@@ f@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the size of the full mo@@ on .
So , if you can imagine the full mo@@ on .
And there are now 10@@ ,000 gal@@ axi@@ es vi@@ sible within that ima@@ ge .
And the fa@@ in@@ t@@ ness of those imag@@ es and the tin@@ y size is only a resul@@ t of the fact that those gal@@ axi@@ es are so far away , the v@@ ast dist@@ an@@ ces .
And each of those gal@@ axi@@ es may con@@ tain within it a few billion or even hundre@@ ds of bi@@ llions of individu@@ al star@@ s .
T@@ el@@ esco@@ pes are like time mach@@ in@@ es .
So the far@@ ther back we look in space , the f@@ ur@@ ther back we see in time .
And they &apos;re like light b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts — liter@@ ally , they col@@ lec@@ t light .
So lar@@ ger the b@@ uc@@ ket , the lar@@ ger the mir@@ ro@@ r we have , the more light we can see , and the far@@ ther back we can vie@@ w .
So , we &apos;ve learned in the last cent@@ ur@@ y that there are ex@@ o@@ tic ob@@ jects in the universe — black h@@ ol@@ es .
We &apos;ve even learned that there &apos;s dar@@ k matter and dar@@ k energy that we can &apos;t see .
So you &apos;re looking now at an actual ima@@ ge of dar@@ k matter .
( Laughter ) You got it . No@@ t all audi@@ ences get that . ( Laughter )
So the way we inf@@ er the pres@@ ence of dar@@ k matter — we can &apos;t see it — but there &apos;s an un@@ mi@@ sta@@ k@@ able tu@@ g , du@@ e to gra@@ vi@@ ty .
We now can look out , we see this sea of gal@@ axi@@ es in a universe that &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding .
What I do myself is to meas@@ ure the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the universe , and one of the pro@@ jects that I car@@ ri@@ ed out in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s used the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe to meas@@ ure how f@@ ast the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding .
We can now tra@@ ce back to 1@@ 4 billion years .
We &apos;ve learned over time that star@@ s have individu@@ al histori@@ es ; that is , they have bir@@ th , they have mi@@ d@@ dle ages and some of them even have dra@@ ma@@ tic de@@ a@@ ths .
So the e@@ mb@@ ers from those star@@ s actually then form the new star@@ s that we see , most of which turn out to have plane@@ ts going around them .
And one of the really sur@@ pri@@ sing resul@@ ts in the last 20 years has been the disco@@ very of other plane@@ ts going around other star@@ s .
These are called ex@@ op@@ lan@@ e@@ ts .
And until 19@@ 9@@ 5 , we didn &apos;t even know the exist@@ ence of any other plane@@ ts , other than going around our own s@@ un .
But now , there are almost 2@@ ,000 other plane@@ ts or@@ b@@ it@@ ing other star@@ s that we can now detec@@ t , meas@@ ure mas@@ ses for .
There are 5@@ 00 of those that are multi@@ ple@@ -@@ plan@@ et syste@@ ms .
And there are 4@@ ,000 — and still coun@@ ting — other can@@ di@@ da@@ tes for plane@@ ts or@@ b@@ it@@ ing other star@@ s .
They come in a be@@ w@@ il@@ der@@ ing vari@@ e@@ ty of different kinds .
There are J@@ u@@ p@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ like plane@@ ts that are ho@@ t , there are other plane@@ ts that are ic@@ y , there are water wor@@ l@@ ds and there are ro@@ c@@ k@@ y plane@@ ts like the Earth , so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; super@@ -@@ Ear@@ ths , &quot; &quot; and there have even been plane@@ ts that have been spe@@ cu@@ la@@ ted dia@@ mon@@ d wor@@ l@@ ds .
So we know there &apos;s at le@@ ast one plan@@ et , our own Earth , in which there is life .
We &apos;ve even found plane@@ ts that are or@@ b@@ it@@ ing two star@@ s .
That &apos;s no lon@@ ger the pro@@ vin@@ ce of science fi@@ c@@ tion .
So around our own plan@@ et , we know there &apos;s life , we &apos;ve developed a comple@@ x life , we now can question our own ori@@ g@@ ins .
And given all that we &apos;ve disco@@ vered , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming nu@@ mb@@ ers now su@@ gg@@ est that there may be mi@@ llions , per@@ haps — maybe even hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions — of other &#91; plane@@ ts &#93; that are clo@@ se enough — just the right dist@@ ance from their star@@ s that they &apos;re or@@ b@@ it@@ ing — to have the exist@@ ence of li@@ qui@@ d water and maybe could po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally sup@@ port life .
So we mar@@ vel now at those o@@ d@@ ds , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming o@@ d@@ ds , and the amazing thing is that within the next deca@@ de , the G@@ M@@ T may be able to take spec@@ tra of the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es of those plane@@ ts , and determin@@ e whether or not they have the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for life .
So , what is the G@@ M@@ T project ?
It &apos;s an inter@@ national project .
It inclu@@ des Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , S@@ outh K@@ o@@ rea , and I &apos;m happ@@ y to say , being here in R@@ io , that the ne@@ w@@ est par@@ t@@ ner in our telesco@@ pe is B@@ raz@@ il .
( Applause ) It also inclu@@ des a number of institu@@ tions across the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , inclu@@ ding H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Uni@@ versi@@ ty , the S@@ mi@@ th@@ son@@ i@@ an and the Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e In@@ stitu@@ tions , and the Uni@@ versi@@ ties of A@@ ri@@ zona , C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go , T@@ ex@@ as@@ -@@ A@@ us@@ ti@@ n and T@@ ex@@ as A &@@ amp@@ ; M Uni@@ versi@@ ty .
It also invol@@ ves C@@ hi@@ le .
Ta@@ ke ch@@ un@@ ks of g@@ la@@ ss , mel@@ t them in a f@@ ur@@ n@@ ace that is it@@ self r@@ ot@@ ating .
This happens under@@ ne@@ ath the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all sta@@ di@@ um at the Uni@@ versi@@ ty of A@@ ri@@ zona .
It &apos;s t@@ uc@@ ked away under 5@@ 2@@ ,000 se@@ at@@ s .
No@@ body know it &apos;s happen@@ ing .
And there &apos;s es@@ senti@@ ally a r@@ ot@@ ating ca@@ ul@@ dr@@ on .
The mir@@ r@@ ors are ca@@ st and they &apos;re co@@ o@@ led very s@@ low@@ ly , and then they &apos;re poli@@ sh@@ ed to an ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te preci@@ sion .
And so , if you think about the preci@@ sion of these mir@@ r@@ ors , the bu@@ mp@@ s on the mir@@ ro@@ r , over the entire 2@@ 7 fe@@ et , amount to less than on@@ e@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of an in@@ ch .
So , can you visu@@ aliz@@ e that ?
O@@ w !
( Laughter ) That &apos;s one fi@@ ve@@ -@@ thousan@@ d@@ ths of the wi@@ d@@ th of one of my ha@@ ir@@ s , over this entire 2@@ 7 fe@@ et .
It &apos;s a spec@@ ta@@ cular ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ment .
It &apos;s what al@@ lo@@ ws us to have the preci@@ sion that we will have .
So , what does that preci@@ sion bu@@ y us ?
So the G@@ M@@ T , if you can imagine — if I were to h@@ old up a co@@ in , which I just happen to have , and I look at the face of that co@@ in , I can see from here the wri@@ ting on the co@@ in ; I can see the face on that co@@ in .
My gu@@ ess that even in the front row , you can &apos;t see that .
But if we were to turn the Gi@@ ant M@@ ag@@ el@@ lan T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe , all 8@@ 0@@ -@@ fe@@ et dia@@ me@@ ter that we see in this audi@@ tori@@ um , and point it 200 miles away , if I were stan@@ ding in S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , we could res@@ ol@@ ve the face of this co@@ in .
That &apos;s the extraordin@@ ary res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion and power of this telesco@@ pe .
And if we were — ( Applause ) If an a@@ st@@ ro@@ na@@ ut went up to the Mo@@ on , a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a million miles away , and li@@ t a can@@ dle — a single can@@ dle — then we would be able to detec@@ t it , using the G@@ M@@ T .
Qu@@ i@@ te extraordin@@ ary .
This is a si@@ mu@@ la@@ ted ima@@ ge of a cl@@ us@@ ter in a ne@@ ar@@ by gal@@ ax@@ y .
&quot; &quot; N@@ ear@@ by &quot; &quot; is a@@ st@@ ro@@ no@@ mi@@ cal , it &apos;s all rela@@ tive .
It &apos;s ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ years away .
This is what this cl@@ us@@ ter would look like .
So look at those four b@@ right ob@@ jects , and now le@@ ts compar@@ e it with a cam@@ era on the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe .
You can see fa@@ int de@@ ta@@ il that star@@ ts to come through .
And now finally — and look how dra@@ ma@@ tic this is — this is what the G@@ M@@ T will see .
So , keep your eyes on those b@@ right imag@@ es again .
This is what we see on one of the most power@@ ful exist@@ ing telesco@@ pes on the Earth , and this , again , what the G@@ M@@ T will see .
Ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary preci@@ sion .
So , where are we ?
We have now le@@ ve@@ led the top of the moun@@ tain@@ top in C@@ hi@@ le .
We b@@ la@@ s@@ ted that off .
We &apos;ve t@@ es@@ ted and poli@@ sh@@ ed the first mir@@ ro@@ r .
We &apos;ve ca@@ st the second and the th@@ ird mir@@ r@@ ors .
And we &apos;re about to ca@@ st the f@@ our@@ th mir@@ ro@@ r .
We had a seri@@ es of re@@ vie@@ ws this year , inter@@ national pan@@ els that came in and re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed us , and said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re ready to go to con@@ struc@@ tion . &quot; &quot; And so we pla@@ n on buil@@ ding this telesco@@ pe with the first four mir@@ r@@ ors .
We want to get on the air qu@@ ick@@ ly , and be taking science data — what we a@@ st@@ ro@@ no@@ m@@ ers call &quot; &quot; first light , &quot; &quot; in 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
And the full telesco@@ pe will be fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed in the mi@@ d@@ dle of the next deca@@ de , with all se@@ ven mir@@ r@@ ors .
So we &apos;re now poi@@ sed to look back at the dist@@ ant universe , the co@@ s@@ mic da@@ wn .
We &apos;ll be able to study other plane@@ ts in ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te de@@ ta@@ il .
But for me , one of the most exci@@ ting things about buil@@ ding the G@@ M@@ T is the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to actually disco@@ ver something that we don &apos;t know about — that we can &apos;t even imagine at this point , something comple@@ tely new .
And my hope is that with the con@@ struc@@ tion of this and other faci@@ li@@ ties , that many young wo@@ men and men will be in@@ spi@@ red to re@@ ach for the star@@ s .
Thank you very much .
O@@ bri@@ gado .
( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Thank you , W@@ en@@ dy .
Sta@@ y with me , because I have a question for you .
You men@@ tion@@ ed different faci@@ li@@ ties .
So the M@@ ag@@ el@@ lan T@@ el@@ esco@@ pe is going up , but also A@@ L@@ M@@ A and others in C@@ hi@@ le and el@@ se@@ where , inclu@@ ding in Ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i .
I@@ s it about co@@ oper@@ ation and comple@@ men@@ tar@@ ity , or about com@@ peti@@ tion ?
I know there &apos;s com@@ peti@@ tion in ter@@ ms of fun@@ ding , but what about the science ?
W@@ en@@ dy F@@ ree@@ d@@ man : In ter@@ ms of the science , they &apos;re very comple@@ men@@ tar@@ y .
So when we disco@@ ver other plane@@ ts , we &apos;ll be able to test those obser@@ va@@ tions , we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es , be able to look in space with very high res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
So , they &apos;re very comple@@ men@@ tar@@ y .
You &apos;re right about the fun@@ ding , we com@@ pe@@ te ; but scienti@@ fi@@ cally , it &apos;s very comple@@ men@@ tar@@ y .
B@@ G : W@@ en@@ dy , th@@ ank you very much for coming to TE@@ D@@ G@@ lo@@ b@@ al .
W@@ F : Thank you .
( Applause )
So , this is an a@@ sto@@ un@@ ding table .
Because this is wrong .
So , what is cancer , first of all ?
So , as an a@@ side , I fir@@ m@@ ly believe in the fiel@@ d of trying to identi@@ f@@ y cancer early .
It is the only way you can start to fi@@ ght cancer , is by ca@@ t@@ ching it early .
You know , the pre@@ vi@@ ous talk al@@ lu@@ ded to pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing heart disease .
So the dise@@ ases we have today , which ref@@ lec@@ t pa@@ tter@@ ns in the system over the last se@@ ver@@ al deca@@ des , are going to change dra@@ ma@@ tically over the next deca@@ de or so based on things like this .
E@@ ach of the red d@@ ots are where a prote@@ in has actually been identi@@ fi@@ ed .
It was in her brain , in her l@@ un@@ gs , in her li@@ ver .
That cancer rec@@ ur@@ red , and she pas@@ sed away three years later from l@@ un@@ g cancer , but she got three years from a drug wh@@ ose sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms pre@@ do@@ min@@ ately were ac@@ ne .
You don &apos;t need to sh@@ r@@ in@@ k the disease .
W@@ ould it have been 10 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters , or am I gi@@ ving you a drug with no ben@@ ef@@ it and signifi@@ can@@ t co@@ st ?
And , again , that &apos;s where these new technolo@@ gi@@ es can come in .
Now this is a very un@@ -@@ TE@@ D@@ -@@ like thing to do , but let &apos;s k@@ ick off the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with a mes@@ sa@@ ge from a my@@ ster@@ y s@@ pon@@ s@@ or .
An@@ on@@ y@@ mous : De@@ ar Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws , it has come to our un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate attention that both the name and n@@ ature of An@@ on@@ y@@ mous has been ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed .
We are everyone . We are no one .
We are an@@ on@@ y@@ mous . We are le@@ gi@@ on .
We do not for@@ give . We do not for@@ get .
We are but the base of cha@@ os .
M@@ is@@ ha G@@ len@@ ny : An@@ on@@ y@@ mous , la@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men — a so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted gro@@ up of poli@@ tically mo@@ tiv@@ ated hac@@ kers who have emer@@ ged in 20@@ 1@@ 1 .
And they &apos;re pretty s@@ car@@ y .
You never know when they &apos;re going to at@@ ta@@ ck next , who or what the conse@@ quen@@ ces will be .
But inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , they have a sense of hu@@ mor .
These gu@@ ys hac@@ ked into Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ac@@ coun@@ t to an@@ no@@ un@@ ce P@@ res@@ id@@ ent O@@ ba@@ ma &apos;s as@@ sa@@ s@@ sin@@ ation .
Now you can imagine the p@@ ani@@ c that would have gener@@ ated in the ne@@ w@@ s@@ room at Fo@@ x .
&quot; &quot; What do we do now ?
P@@ ut on a black ar@@ mb@@ and , or cra@@ ck open the cha@@ m@@ pa@@ g@@ ne ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And of course , who could es@@ ca@@ pe the i@@ ron@@ y of a member of R@@ u@@ per@@ t M@@ ur@@ do@@ ch &apos;s Ne@@ ws C@@ or@@ p@@ .
being a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m of hac@@ king for a change .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So@@ me@@ times you turn on the news and you say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any@@ one left to h@@ ack ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ony P@@ la@@ y@@ sta@@ tion Ne@@ t@@ work — done , the government of Tur@@ k@@ ey — tic@@ k , Bri@@ tain &apos;s S@@ er@@ i@@ ous O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ zed C@@ ri@@ me A@@ gen@@ cy — a bre@@ e@@ ze , the C@@ I@@ A — fal@@ ling off a lo@@ g .
In fact , a fri@@ end of min@@ e from the se@@ curi@@ ty indu@@ stry told me the other day that there are two ty@@ pes of comp@@ ani@@ es in the world : those that know they &apos;ve been hac@@ ked , and those that don &apos;t .
I mean three comp@@ ani@@ es pro@@ vi@@ ding cy@@ ber@@ se@@ curi@@ ty ser@@ vi@@ ces to the F@@ B@@ I have been hac@@ ked .
I@@ s nothing sac@@ red any@@ more , for he@@ a@@ ven &apos;s sa@@ ke ?
An@@ y@@ way , this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous gro@@ up An@@ on@@ y@@ mous — and they would say this themselves — they are pro@@ vi@@ ding a ser@@ vi@@ ce by de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ting how u@@ sel@@ ess comp@@ ani@@ es are at protec@@ ting our data .
But there is also a very seri@@ ous as@@ pec@@ t to An@@ on@@ y@@ mous — they are ide@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally dri@@ ven .
They cla@@ i@@ m that they are bat@@ t@@ ling a da@@ star@@ d@@ ly con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y .
They say that govern@@ ments are trying to take over the Internet and control it , and that they , An@@ on@@ y@@ mous , are the au@@ th@@ enti@@ c vo@@ ice of resist@@ ance — be it aga@@ in@@ st M@@ id@@ dle E@@ a@@ ster@@ n dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ shi@@ ps , aga@@ in@@ st global media cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions , or aga@@ in@@ st inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , or who@@ ever it is .
And their poli@@ tics are not enti@@ re@@ ly un@@ at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive .
Okay , they &apos;re a little in@@ cho@@ ate .
There &apos;s a st@@ rong whi@@ ff of hal@@ f-@@ ba@@ ked an@@ ar@@ ch@@ ism about them .
But one thing is true : we are at the beg@@ in@@ ning of a mi@@ gh@@ ty stru@@ gg@@ le for control of the Internet .
The W@@ e@@ b lin@@ ks everything , and very so@@ on it will medi@@ ate most human activi@@ ty .
Because the Internet has fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed a new and comp@@ lica@@ ted environment for an ol@@ d-@@ age di@@ le@@ m@@ ma that p@@ its the de@@ man@@ ds of se@@ curi@@ ty with the des@@ i@@ re for f@@ ree@@ dom .
Now this is a very comp@@ lica@@ ted stru@@ gg@@ le .
And un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , for mor@@ tal@@ s like you and me , we probably can &apos;t understand it very well .
N@@ on@@ e@@ the@@ less , in an un@@ expec@@ ted at@@ ta@@ ck of hu@@ br@@ is a cou@@ ple of years ago , I decided I would try and do that .
And I sort of get it .
These were the vari@@ ous things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it .
But in order to try and ex@@ pla@@ in the whole thing , I would need another 1@@ 8 minu@@ tes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on tr@@ ust from me on this oc@@ ca@@ sion , and let me as@@ sure you that all of these is@@ su@@ es are invol@@ ved in cy@@ ber@@ se@@ curi@@ ty and control of the Internet one way or the other , but in a confi@@ gu@@ ra@@ tion that even Ste@@ ph@@ en Ha@@ w@@ king would probably have dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty trying to get his head around .
So there you are .
And as you see , in the mi@@ d@@ dle , there is our old fri@@ end , the hac@@ ker .
The hac@@ ker is absolu@@ tely cent@@ ral to many of the poli@@ tical , social and econo@@ mic is@@ su@@ es af@@ fec@@ ting the N@@ et .
And so I thought to myself , &quot; Well , these are the gu@@ ys who I want to talk to . &quot;
And what do you know , no@@ body else does talk to the hac@@ kers .
They &apos;re comple@@ tely an@@ on@@ y@@ mous , as it were .
So des@@ pi@@ te the fact that we are beg@@ in@@ ning to po@@ u@@ r bi@@ llions , hundre@@ ds of bi@@ llions of dollars , into cy@@ ber@@ se@@ curi@@ ty — for the most extraordin@@ ary tech@@ ni@@ cal solu@@ tions — no one wan@@ ts to talk to these gu@@ ys , the hac@@ kers , who are doing everything .
In@@ stead , we pre@@ fer these really da@@ z@@ z@@ ling technolo@@ gi@@ cal solu@@ tions , which co@@ st a hu@@ ge amount of money .
And so nothing is going into the hac@@ kers .
Well , I say nothing , but actually there is one te@@ en@@ y we@@ en@@ y little research un@@ it in Tur@@ in , I@@ tal@@ y called the H@@ ac@@ kers Pro@@ fi@@ ling Pro@@ ject .
And they are doing some fan@@ ta@@ stic research into the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics , into the abili@@ ties and the soci@@ aliz@@ ation of hac@@ kers .
But because they &apos;re a U.@@ N@@ . oper@@ ation , maybe that &apos;s why govern@@ ments and cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions are not that interes@@ ted in them .
Because it &apos;s a U.@@ N@@ . oper@@ ation , of course , it l@@ ac@@ ks fun@@ ding .
But I think they &apos;re doing very important work .
Because where we have a sur@@ pl@@ us of technology in the cy@@ ber@@ se@@ curi@@ ty indu@@ stry , we have a defini@@ te lack of — call me ol@@ d-@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed — human inte@@ lli@@ gen@@ ce .
Now , so far I &apos;ve men@@ tion@@ ed the hac@@ kers An@@ on@@ y@@ mous who are a poli@@ tically mo@@ tiv@@ ated hac@@ king gro@@ up .
O@@ f course , the cri@@ min@@ al j@@ us@@ tice system tre@@ at@@ s them as common old gar@@ den cri@@ min@@ als .
But inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , An@@ on@@ y@@ mous does not make use of its hac@@ ked information for finan@@ cial ga@@ in .
But what about the real cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als ?
Well real organi@@ zed cri@@ me on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a gro@@ up of gi@@ f@@ ted U@@ k@@ ra@@ ini@@ an hac@@ kers developed a we@@ b@@ si@@ te , which led to the industri@@ aliz@@ ation of cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me .
W@@ el@@ come to the now for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten re@@ al@@ m of Car@@ der@@ P@@ lan@@ et .
This is how they were ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing themselves a deca@@ de ago on the N@@ et .
Now Car@@ der@@ P@@ lan@@ et was very interesting .
C@@ y@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als would go there to bu@@ y and se@@ ll st@@ ol@@ en cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d de@@ ta@@ il@@ s , to ex@@ change information about new mal@@ w@@ are that was out there .
And remember , this is a time when we &apos;re see@@ ing for the first time so@@ -@@ called of@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ sh@@ el@@ f mal@@ w@@ are .
This is ready for use , out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x stuff , which you can de@@ p@@ lo@@ y even if you &apos;re not a terri@@ bly so@@ ph@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted hac@@ ker .
And so Car@@ der@@ P@@ lan@@ et became a sort of super@@ mar@@ ket for cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als .
And its cre@@ at@@ ors were incre@@ di@@ bly s@@ mar@@ t and ent@@ re@@ pren@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al , because they were fac@@ ed with one enor@@ mous ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge as cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als .
And that ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge is : How do you do bus@@ in@@ ess , how do you tr@@ ust somebody on the W@@ e@@ b who you want to do bus@@ in@@ ess with when you know that they &apos;re a cri@@ min@@ al ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s axi@@ o@@ ma@@ tic that they &apos;re do@@ d@@ gy , and they &apos;re going to want to try and ri@@ p you off .
So the family , as the in@@ ner co@@ re of Car@@ der@@ P@@ lan@@ et was kno@@ wn , came up with this bri@@ lli@@ ant idea called the es@@ cro@@ w system .
They ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted an of@@ fi@@ cer who would medi@@ ate between the ven@@ dor and the pur@@ cha@@ ser .
The ven@@ dor , say , had st@@ ol@@ en cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ; the pur@@ cha@@ ser wanted to get a h@@ old of them .
The pur@@ cha@@ ser would sen@@ d the ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive of@@ fi@@ cer some dollars di@@ g@@ it@@ ally , and the ven@@ dor would se@@ ll the st@@ ol@@ en cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d de@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
And the of@@ fi@@ cer would then ver@@ i@@ f@@ y if the st@@ ol@@ en cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d worked .
And if they did , he then pas@@ sed on the money to the ven@@ dor and the st@@ ol@@ en cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d de@@ ta@@ il@@ s to the pur@@ cha@@ ser .
And it was this which comple@@ tely re@@ volu@@ tion@@ i@@ zed cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me on the W@@ e@@ b .
And after that , it just went w@@ il@@ d .
We had a cha@@ m@@ pa@@ g@@ ne deca@@ de for people who we know as Car@@ ders .
Now I s@@ po@@ ke to one of these Car@@ ders who we &apos;ll call Re@@ d@@ Bri@@ ga@@ de — al@@ though that was@@ n &apos;t even his pro@@ per n@@ ick@@ name — but I pro@@ mi@@ sed I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t re@@ ve@@ al who he was .
And he ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed to me how in 200@@ 3 and 200@@ 4 he would go on s@@ pre@@ es in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , taking out $ 10@@ ,000 from an A@@ T@@ M here , $ 3@@ 0@@ ,000 from an A@@ T@@ M there , using c@@ lon@@ ed cre@@ di@@ t car@@ ds .
He was making , on a@@ ver@@ age a wee@@ k , $ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 — ta@@ x f@@ ree of course .
And he said that he had so much money sta@@ sh@@ ed in his u@@ p@@ per@@ -@@ E@@ ast side apar@@ t@@ ment at one point that he just didn &apos;t know what to do with it and actually f@@ ell into a depres@@ sion .
But that &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly different story , which I w@@ on &apos;t go into now .
Now the interesting thing about Re@@ d@@ Bri@@ ga@@ de is that he was@@ n &apos;t an ad@@ van@@ ced hac@@ ker .
He sort of underst@@ o@@ od the technology , and he realiz@@ ed that se@@ curi@@ ty was very important if you were going to be a Car@@ der , but he didn &apos;t s@@ pen@@ d his days and ni@@ ghts b@@ ent over a computer , e@@ ating pi@@ z@@ za , dr@@ in@@ king co@@ ke and that sort of thing .
He was out there on the to@@ wn having a fa@@ b time en@@ jo@@ ying the high life .
And this is because hac@@ kers are only one ele@@ ment in a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ al en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se .
And of@@ ten they &apos;re the most vulner@@ able ele@@ ment of all .
And I want to ex@@ pla@@ in this to you by in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing you to six char@@ ac@@ ters who I me@@ t while I was doing this research .
D@@ imi@@ try G@@ ol@@ u@@ bo@@ v , a@@ k@@ a S@@ C@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ T — bor@@ n in O@@ des@@ sa , U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine in 19@@ 8@@ 2 .
Now he developed his social and moral compas@@ s on the B@@ lack Se@@ a port dur@@ ing the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s .
This was a sin@@ k@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ s@@ wi@@ m environment where invol@@ ve@@ ment in cri@@ min@@ al or cor@@ ru@@ pt activi@@ ties was enti@@ re@@ ly neces@@ s@@ ary if you wanted to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
As an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed computer us@@ er , what D@@ imi@@ try did was to trans@@ fer the g@@ an@@ g@@ s@@ ter cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism of his ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn on@@ to the W@@ or@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b .
And he did a great job in it .
You have to understand though that from his n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , the only environment he knew was g@@ an@@ g@@ ster@@ ism .
He knew no other way of making a living and making money .
Then we have R@@ en@@ u@@ k@@ an@@ th Su@@ bra@@ man@@ i@@ am , a@@ k@@ a J@@ i@@ L@@ si — fo@@ under of D@@ ar@@ k@@ Mar@@ ket , bor@@ n in Co@@ lo@@ mb@@ o , S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a .
As an ei@@ ght year@@ -old , he and his parents f@@ led the S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ an ca@@ pi@@ tal because S@@ in@@ gh@@ al@@ ese mo@@ b@@ s were ro@@ am@@ ing the city , looking for Ta@@ mi@@ ls like R@@ en@@ u to m@@ ur@@ der .
A@@ t 1@@ 1 , he was inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ ted by the S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ an mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y , ac@@ cu@@ sed of being a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist , and his parents s@@ ent him on his own to Bri@@ tain as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e see@@ king poli@@ tical as@@ y@@ lu@@ m .
A@@ t 1@@ 3 , with only little English and being bul@@ li@@ ed at school , he es@@ ca@@ ped into a world of compu@@ ters where he sho@@ w@@ ed great tech@@ ni@@ cal ability , but he was so@@ on being se@@ duc@@ ed by people on the Internet .
He was con@@ vi@@ c@@ ted of mor@@ t@@ g@@ age and cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d fra@@ u@@ d , and he will be re@@ lea@@ sed from W@@ or@@ m@@ wo@@ od S@@ cru@@ b@@ s j@@ a@@ il in L@@ on@@ don in 20@@ 12 .
M@@ at@@ ri@@ x@@ 0@@ 0@@ 1 , who was an ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tor at D@@ ar@@ k@@ Mar@@ ket .
B@@ or@@ n in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many to a sta@@ ble and w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ res@@ pec@@ ted mi@@ d@@ dle cla@@ ss family , his ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with ga@@ ming as a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er led him to hac@@ king .
And he was so@@ on contro@@ lling hu@@ ge ser@@ ver@@ s around the world where he sto@@ red his games that he had cra@@ c@@ ked and pira@@ ted .
H@@ is sli@@ de into cri@@ min@@ ality was incre@@ mental .
And when he finally wo@@ ke up to his situ@@ ation and underst@@ o@@ od the imp@@ lica@@ tions , he was already in too de@@ ep .
Ma@@ x Vi@@ sion , a@@ k@@ a I@@ C@@ E@@ M@@ A@@ N — ma@@ ster@@ mind of Car@@ der@@ s@@ Mar@@ ket .
B@@ or@@ n in M@@ er@@ i@@ di@@ an , I@@ da@@ h@@ o .
Ma@@ x Vi@@ sion was one of the best pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tion t@@ est@@ ers working out of S@@ an@@ ta C@@ lar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in the late 9@@ 0@@ s for priva@@ te comp@@ ani@@ es and vol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly for the F@@ B@@ I .
Now in the late 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s , he disco@@ vered a vulner@@ ability on all U.@@ S@@ . government ne@@ t@@ works , and he went in and pa@@ t@@ ched it up — because this inclu@@ ded nuc@@ lear research faci@@ li@@ ties — s@@ par@@ ing the Ameri@@ can government a hu@@ ge se@@ curi@@ ty e@@ mb@@ arra@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
But also , because he was an in@@ ve@@ ter@@ ate hac@@ ker , he left a tin@@ y di@@ gi@@ tal wor@@ m@@ ho@@ le through which he al@@ one could cra@@ w@@ l .
But this was s@@ po@@ t@@ ted by an e@@ ag@@ le@@ -@@ ey@@ e investi@@ g@@ at@@ or , and he was con@@ vi@@ c@@ ted .
A@@ t his open pri@@ son , he came under the inf@@ lu@@ ence of finan@@ cial fra@@ ud@@ st@@ ers , and those finan@@ cial fra@@ ud@@ st@@ ers per@@ su@@ a@@ ded him to work for them on his re@@ le@@ ase .
And this man with a plane@@ tar@@ y@@ -@@ si@@ zed brain is now ser@@ ving a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year s@@ ent@@ ence in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
A@@ de@@ wal@@ e Ta@@ i@@ w@@ o , a@@ k@@ a F@@ re@@ d@@ dy@@ B@@ B — mas@@ ter b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t cra@@ c@@ ker from A@@ bu@@ j@@ a in N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia .
He set up his pro@@ sa@@ ic@@ ally enti@@ t@@ led ne@@ w@@ s@@ gro@@ up , ban@@ k@@ fra@@ u@@ ds @ y@@ a@@ ho@@ o@@ .@@ co@@ .@@ u@@ k before ar@@ ri@@ ving in Bri@@ tain in 200@@ 5 to take a Ma@@ st@@ ers in che@@ mi@@ cal eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing at Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter Uni@@ versi@@ ty .
He imp@@ res@@ sed in the priva@@ te sec@@ tor , develo@@ ping che@@ mi@@ cal ap@@ pli@@ ca@@ tions for the oil indu@@ stry while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously run@@ ning a wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de b@@ ank and cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d fra@@ u@@ d oper@@ ation that was wor@@ th mi@@ llions until his ar@@ res@@ t in 200@@ 8 .
And then finally , C@@ aga@@ ta@@ y E@@ v@@ y@@ ap@@ an , a@@ k@@ a C@@ ha@@ 0 — one of the most re@@ mar@@ k@@ able hac@@ kers ever , from An@@ k@@ ara in Tur@@ k@@ ey .
He com@@ bin@@ ed the tre@@ men@@ dous s@@ ki@@ lls of a ge@@ e@@ k with the su@@ a@@ ve social eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing s@@ ki@@ lls of the mas@@ ter cri@@ min@@ al .
One of the s@@ mar@@ test people I &apos;ve ever me@@ t .
He also had the most effec@@ tive virtual priva@@ te ne@@ t@@ work se@@ curi@@ ty ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment the poli@@ ce have ever en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed a@@ mon@@ g@@ st global cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als .
Now the important thing about all of these people is they share cer@@ tain char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics des@@ pi@@ te the fact that they come from very different environ@@ ments .
They are all people who learned their hac@@ king s@@ ki@@ lls in their early to mi@@ d-@@ te@@ ens . They are all people
who de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te ad@@ van@@ ced ability in ma@@ ths and the sci@@ ences .
Re@@ member that , when they developed those hac@@ king s@@ ki@@ lls , their moral compas@@ s had not yet developed .
And most of them , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of S@@ C@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ T and C@@ ha@@ 0 , they did not de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te any real social s@@ ki@@ lls in the out@@ side world — only on the W@@ e@@ b .
And the other thing is the high inci@@ den@@ ce of hac@@ kers like these who have char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics which are consi@@ st@@ ent with As@@ per@@ ger &apos;s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
Now I dis@@ c@@ us@@ sed this with Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or S@@ im@@ on B@@ ar@@ on-@@ Co@@ h@@ en who &apos;s the profes@@ s@@ or of develo@@ p@@ mental p@@ sy@@ cho@@ path@@ o@@ logy at C@@ a@@ mb@@ ri@@ dge .
And he has done path@@ -@@ bre@@ a@@ king work on autism and con@@ fir@@ med , also for the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties here , that G@@ ary M@@ c@@ K@@ in@@ non — who is wanted by the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes for hac@@ king into the Pen@@ ta@@ g@@ on — suf@@ fer@@ s from As@@ per@@ ger &apos;s and a secon@@ dar@@ y condi@@ tion of depres@@ sion .
And B@@ ar@@ on-@@ Co@@ h@@ en ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed that cer@@ tain disa@@ bili@@ ties can man@@ i@@ f@@ est themselves in the hac@@ king and compu@@ ting world as tre@@ men@@ dous s@@ ki@@ lls , and that we should not be th@@ ro@@ wing in j@@ a@@ il people who have such disa@@ bili@@ ties and s@@ ki@@ lls because they have lost their way soci@@ ally or been du@@ ped .
Now I think we &apos;re mis@@ sing a tri@@ ck here , because I don &apos;t think people like Ma@@ x Vi@@ sion should be in j@@ a@@ il .
And let me be b@@ l@@ unt about this .
In Ch@@ ina , in R@@ us@@ si@@ a and in lo@@ ads of other countries that are develo@@ ping cy@@ ber@@ -@@ of@@ fen@@ sive cap@@ abili@@ ties , this is exactly what they are doing .
They are rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ing hac@@ kers both before and after they become invol@@ ved in cri@@ min@@ al and industri@@ al es@@ pi@@ on@@ age activi@@ ties — are mo@@ bili@@ zing them on be@@ half of the sta@@ te .
We need to eng@@ age and find ways of of@@ fer@@ ing gu@@ id@@ ance to these young people , because they are a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able bre@@ ed .
And if we re@@ ly , as we do at the moment , so@@ le@@ ly on the cri@@ min@@ al j@@ us@@ tice system and the th@@ re@@ at of p@@ uni@@ tive s@@ enten@@ ces , we will be n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a mon@@ s@@ ter we cannot ta@@ me .
Thank you very much for listen@@ ing .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So your idea wor@@ th s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing is hi@@ re hac@@ kers .
How would someone get over that kind of fe@@ ar that the hac@@ ker they hi@@ re might pres@@ er@@ ve that little te@@ en@@ s@@ y wor@@ m@@ ho@@ le ?
M@@ G : I think to an ex@@ t@@ ent , you have to understand that it &apos;s axi@@ o@@ ma@@ tic a@@ mon@@ g hac@@ kers that they do that .
They &apos;re just re@@ l@@ ent@@ less and ob@@ s@@ es@@ sive about what they do .
But all of the people who I &apos;ve s@@ po@@ ken to who have fal@@ l@@ en f@@ ou@@ l of the la@@ w , they have all said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , ple@@ ase give us a chan@@ ce to work in the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate indu@@ stry .
We just never knew how to get there , what we were doing .
We want to work with you . &quot; &quot; Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Okay , well that makes sense . Th@@ an@@ ks a lot M@@ is@@ ha .
( Applause )
Af@@ ter all , take a look at these ev@@ ents : I@@ m@@ peri@@ al@@ ism and co@@ lon@@ i@@ z@@ ation , world war@@ s , Ge@@ or@@ ge W@@ . B@@ us@@ h .
As@@ k yourself , who &apos;s respon@@ sible ? A@@ d@@ ul@@ ts .
Now , what have kids done ?
Well , An@@ ne Fran@@ k tou@@ ched mi@@ llions with her power@@ ful ac@@ coun@@ t of the Ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust .
R@@ u@@ by Bri@@ d@@ ges hel@@ ped to end se@@ gre@@ ga@@ tion in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
Now , if you don &apos;t tr@@ ust someone , you place r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ tions on them , right ?
Now , what &apos;s even wor@@ se than r@@ est@@ ri@@ c@@ tion , is that adul@@ ts of@@ ten under@@ esti@@ mate kids &apos; abili@@ ties .
Thank you , B@@ ill G@@ ates , and th@@ ank you , M@@ a .
In@@ stead of just s@@ co@@ f@@ f@@ ing at this her@@ es@@ y that a kid wanted to get publi@@ sh@@ ed , or saying wa@@ it until you &apos;re ol@@ der , my parents were really sup@@ por@@ tive .
One lar@@ ge children &apos;s publi@@ sh@@ er i@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally said that they didn &apos;t work with children .
K@@ i@@ ds grow up and become adul@@ ts just like you .
It &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the D@@ ar@@ k Ag@@ es any@@ more .
Now , the world nee@@ ds op@@ portuni@@ ties for new lea@@ ders and new ideas .
K@@ i@@ ds need op@@ portuni@@ ties to le@@ ad and suc@@ ce@@ ed .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
So I &apos;m going to talk to you about you about the poli@@ tical che@@ mi@@ stry of oil spi@@ lls and why this is an incre@@ di@@ bly important , long , o@@ i@@ ly , ho@@ t su@@ mm@@ er , and why we need to keep ourselves from getting dist@@ rac@@ ted .
But before I talk about the poli@@ tical che@@ mi@@ stry , I actually need to talk about the che@@ mi@@ stry of oil .
This is a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h from when I visi@@ ted P@@ ru@@ d@@ ho@@ e B@@ ay in A@@ la@@ sk@@ a in 200@@ 2 to wat@@ ch the M@@ in@@ er@@ als Man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment S@@ er@@ vi@@ ce t@@ esting their ability to bur@@ n oil spi@@ lls in ice .
And what you see here is , you see a little bit of cru@@ de oil , you see some ice cu@@ b@@ es , and you see two san@@ d@@ w@@ ich b@@ ag@@ gi@@ es of na@@ pal@@ m .
The na@@ pal@@ m is bur@@ ning there quite n@@ ic@@ e@@ ly .
And the thing is , is that oil is really an ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tion for us as the Ameri@@ can consu@@ m@@ er .
We &apos;re four percent of the world &apos;s population ; we use 25 percent of the world &apos;s oil produc@@ tion .
And we don &apos;t really understand what oil is , until you ch@@ ec@@ k out its mole@@ cul@@ es , And you don &apos;t really understand that until you see this stuff bur@@ n .
So this is what happens as that bur@@ n gets going .
It takes off . It &apos;s a big w@@ oo@@ sh .
I high@@ ly re@@ com@@ men@@ d that you get a chan@@ ce to see cru@@ de oil bur@@ n some@@ day , because you will never need to he@@ ar another po@@ l@@ i s@@ c@@ i lec@@ ture on the ge@@ o@@ poli@@ tics of oil again .
It &apos;ll just ba@@ ke your re@@ tin@@ as .
So there it is ; the re@@ tin@@ as are ba@@ king .
Let me tell you a little bit about this che@@ mi@@ stry of oil .
O@@ il is a ste@@ w of hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ on mole@@ cul@@ es .
It star@@ ts of with the very small ones , which are one car@@ b@@ on , four hy@@ dro@@ gen — that &apos;s me@@ th@@ an@@ e — it just flo@@ at@@ s off .
Then there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of inter@@ medi@@ ate ones with mi@@ d@@ dle amo@@ un@@ ts of car@@ b@@ on .
You &apos;ve probably heard of ben@@ z@@ en@@ e r@@ ings ; they &apos;re very car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic .
And it goes all the way over to these big , th@@ ick , gal@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ y ones that have hundre@@ ds of car@@ b@@ ons , and they have thousands of hy@@ dro@@ gen@@ s , and they have van@@ adi@@ um and he@@ av@@ y me@@ tal@@ s and sul@@ fu@@ r and all kinds of cra@@ z@@ in@@ ess han@@ ging off the si@@ des of them .
Th@@ ose are called the as@@ ph@@ al@@ ten@@ es ; they &apos;re an ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent in as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
They &apos;re very important in oil spi@@ lls .
Let me tell you a little bit about the che@@ mi@@ stry of oil in water .
It is this che@@ mi@@ stry that makes oil so disa@@ st@@ ro@@ us .
O@@ il doesn &apos;t sin@@ k , it flo@@ at@@ s .
If it s@@ ank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil sp@@ ill .
And the other thing it does is it s@@ pre@@ ads out the moment it h@@ its the water .
It s@@ pre@@ ads out to be really th@@ in , so you have a hard time cor@@ r@@ al@@ ling it .
The next thing that happens is the light ends e@@ va@@ po@@ rate , and some of the to@@ xi@@ c things flo@@ at into the water co@@ lu@@ m@@ n and k@@ ill fish e@@ g@@ gs and s@@ mal@@ ler fish and things like that , and sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
And then the as@@ ph@@ al@@ ten@@ es — and this is the cru@@ cial thing — the as@@ ph@@ al@@ ten@@ es get whi@@ p@@ ped by the wa@@ ves into a fro@@ th@@ y e@@ mul@@ sion , something like ma@@ y@@ on@@ na@@ i@@ se .
It tri@@ pl@@ es the amount of o@@ i@@ ly , mes@@ s@@ y go@@ o that you have in the water , and it makes it very hard to han@@ dle .
It also makes it very vis@@ co@@ us .
When the P@@ res@@ ti@@ ge s@@ ank off the co@@ ast of S@@ pa@@ in , there were big , flo@@ ating c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons the size of sof@@ a c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons of e@@ mul@@ si@@ fi@@ ed oil , with the consi@@ st@@ en@@ cy , or the vis@@ co@@ si@@ ty , of che@@ wing gu@@ m .
It &apos;s incre@@ di@@ bly hard to c@@ le@@ an up .
And every single oil is different when it h@@ its water .
When the che@@ mi@@ stry of the oil and water also h@@ its our poli@@ tics , it &apos;s absolu@@ tely ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sive .
For the first time , Ameri@@ can consu@@ m@@ ers will kind of see the oil sup@@ p@@ ly cha@@ in in front of themselves .
They have a &quot; &quot; e@@ u@@ re@@ k@@ a ! &quot; &quot; moment , when we su@@ d@@ den@@ ly understand oil in a different con@@ text .
So I &apos;m going to talk just a little bit about the ori@@ g@@ in of these poli@@ tics , because it &apos;s really cru@@ cial to underst@@ an@@ ding why this su@@ mm@@ er is so important , why we need to sta@@ y fo@@ cu@@ sed .
No@@ body gets up in the mor@@ ning and thin@@ ks , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow ! I &apos;m going to go bu@@ y some th@@ ree@@ -@@ car@@ bon@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ on mole@@ cul@@ es to put in my tan@@ k and dri@@ ve hap@@ pi@@ ly to work . &quot; &quot; No , they think , &quot; &quot; U@@ gh . I have to go bu@@ y gas .
I &apos;m so an@@ gr@@ y about it . The oil comp@@ ani@@ es are ri@@ p@@ ping me off .
They set the pri@@ ces , and I don &apos;t even know .
I am hel@@ pl@@ ess over this . &quot; &quot; And this is what happens to us at the gas pu@@ m@@ p — and actually , gas pu@@ mp@@ s are speci@@ fi@@ cally desig@@ ned to dif@@ f@@ use that an@@ ger .
You might no@@ tice that many gas pu@@ mp@@ s , inclu@@ ding this one , are desig@@ ned to look like A@@ T@@ M@@ s .
I &apos;ve tal@@ ked to eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers . That &apos;s speci@@ fi@@ cally to dif@@ f@@ use our an@@ ger , because sup@@ pos@@ e@@ d@@ ly we feel good about A@@ T@@ M@@ s .
( Laughter ) That sho@@ ws you how bad it is .
But actually , I mean , this fe@@ el@@ ing of hel@@ pl@@ es@@ s@@ ness comes in because most Amer@@ ic@@ ans actually feel that oil pri@@ ces are the resul@@ t of a con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y , not of the vi@@ ci@@ s@@ situ@@ des of the world oil mar@@ ket .
And the thing is , too , is that we also feel very hel@@ pl@@ ess about the amount that we consu@@ me , which is some@@ what reas@@ on@@ able , because in fact , we have desig@@ ned this system where , if you want to get a job , it &apos;s much more important to have a car that r@@ uns , to have a job and keep a job , than to have a G@@ E@@ D .
And that &apos;s actually very per@@ ver@@ se .
Now there &apos;s another per@@ ver@@ se thing about the way we bu@@ y gas , which is that we &apos;d ra@@ ther be doing anything else .
This is B@@ P &apos;s gas sta@@ tion in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles .
It is green . It is a sh@@ r@@ ine to gre@@ en@@ is@@ h@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; you think , &quot; &quot; why would something so la@@ me work on people so s@@ mar@@ t ? &quot; &quot; Well , the reason is , is because , when we &apos;re bu@@ ying gas , we &apos;re very inv@@ es@@ ted in this sort of co@@ gni@@ tive dis@@ son@@ ance .
I mean , we &apos;re an@@ gr@@ y at the one hand and we want to be some@@ where else .
We don &apos;t want to be bu@@ ying oil ; we want to be doing something green .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
I mean — and this is fun@@ ny , it loo@@ ks fun@@ ny here .
But in fact , that &apos;s why the s@@ lo@@ gan &quot; &quot; be@@ y@@ on@@ d pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um &quot; &quot; worked .
But it &apos;s an in@@ her@@ ent part of our energy poli@@ cy , which is we don &apos;t talk about re@@ duc@@ ing the amount of oil that we use .
We talk about energy in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce . We talk about hy@@ dro@@ gen car@@ s .
We talk about bio@@ fu@@ els that ha@@ ven &apos;t been in@@ ven@@ ted yet .
And so , co@@ gni@@ tive dis@@ son@@ ance is part and par@@ ce@@ l of the way that we de@@ al with oil , and it &apos;s really important to de@@ al@@ ing with this oil sp@@ ill .
Okay , so the poli@@ tics of oil are very moral in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
The oil indu@@ stry is like a hu@@ ge , gi@@ g@@ anti@@ c oc@@ to@@ p@@ us of eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing and fin@@ ance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral ter@@ ms .
This is an ear@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ on phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h — you can see , we had these g@@ us@@ h@@ ers .
Ear@@ ly j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts looked at these spi@@ lls , and they said , &quot; &quot; This is a fil@@ th@@ y indu@@ stry . &quot; &quot; But they also saw in it that people were getting ri@@ ch for doing nothing .
They wer@@ en &apos;t far@@ m@@ ers , they were just getting ri@@ ch for stuff coming out of the ground .
It &apos;s the &quot; &quot; Be@@ ver@@ ly H@@ ill@@ bi@@ lli@@ es , &quot; &quot; basi@@ cally .
But in the beg@@ in@@ ning , this was seen as a very mor@@ ally proble@@ ma@@ tic thing , long before it became fun@@ ny .
And then , of course , there was Jo@@ h@@ n D@@ . R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ ler .
And the thing about Jo@@ h@@ n D@@ . is that he went into this cha@@ o@@ tic w@@ il@@ d-@@ e@@ ast of oil indu@@ stry , and he ra@@ tion@@ aliz@@ ed it into a ver@@ tically inte@@ gra@@ ted comp@@ any , a mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional .
It was terri@@ f@@ ying ; you think W@@ al@@ mar@@ t is a terri@@ f@@ ying bus@@ in@@ ess mode@@ l now , imagine what this looked like in the 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 0@@ s or 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
And it also the kind of roo@@ t of how we see oil as a con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y .
But what &apos;s really amazing is that I@@ da T@@ ar@@ be@@ ll , the j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist , went in and did a big ex@@ pos@@ é of R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ ler and actually got the whole anti@@ tr@@ ust la@@ ws put in place .
But in many ways , that ima@@ ge of the con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y still stic@@ ks with us .
And here &apos;s one of the things that I@@ da T@@ ar@@ be@@ ll said — she said , &quot; &quot; He has a th@@ in no@@ se like a th@@ or@@ n .
There were no li@@ ps .
There were pu@@ f@@ f@@ s under the little col@@ or@@ less eyes with cre@@ ases run@@ ning from them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Okay , so that guy is actually still with us . ( Laughter )
I mean , this is a very per@@ va@@ sive — this is part of our DNA .
And then there &apos;s this guy , o@@ kay .
So , you might be wonder@@ ing why it is that , every time we have high oil pri@@ ces or an oil sp@@ ill , we call these C@@ E@@ Os down to W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , and we sort of pe@@ p@@ per them with ques@@ tions in publi@@ c and we try to s@@ ha@@ me them .
And this is something that we &apos;ve been doing sin@@ ce 19@@ 7@@ 4 , when we first asked them , &quot; &quot; Why are there these ob@@ s@@ cen@@ e prof@@ its ? &quot; &quot; And we &apos;ve sort of person@@ aliz@@ ed the whole oil indu@@ stry into these C@@ E@@ Os .
And we take it as , you know — we look at it on a moral level , ra@@ ther than looking at it on a le@@ g@@ al and finan@@ cial level .
And so I &apos;m not saying these gu@@ ys ar@@ en &apos;t li@@ able to answer ques@@ tions — I &apos;m just saying that , when you fo@@ c@@ us on whether they are or are not a bun@@ ch of gre@@ e@@ dy ba@@ star@@ ds , you don &apos;t actually get around to the point of making la@@ ws that are ei@@ ther going to ei@@ ther change the way they oper@@ ate , or you &apos;re going to get around to really re@@ duc@@ ing the amount of oil and re@@ duc@@ ing our depen@@ den@@ ce on oil .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a dist@@ rac@@ tion .
But it makes for good the@@ ater , and it &apos;s power@@ ful@@ ly ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic as you probably saw last wee@@ k .
So the thing about water oil spi@@ lls is that they are very poli@@ tically gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zing .
I mean , these pic@@ tures — this is from the S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a sp@@ ill .
You have these pic@@ tures of bir@@ ds .
They really inf@@ lu@@ ence people .
When the S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a sp@@ ill happened in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , it for@@ med the environ@@ mental mo@@ ve@@ ment in its moder@@ n form .
It started Earth D@@ ay .
It also put in place the Na@@ tional En@@ vi@@ ron@@ mental Po@@ li@@ cy A@@ c@@ t , the C@@ le@@ an A@@ ir A@@ c@@ t , the C@@ le@@ an W@@ ater A@@ c@@ t .
E@@ very@@ thing that we are really ste@@ m@@ med from this peri@@ od .
I think it &apos;s important to kind of look at these pic@@ tures of the bir@@ ds and understand what happens to us .
Here we are nor@@ m@@ ally ; we &apos;re stan@@ ding at the gas pu@@ m@@ p , and we &apos;re fe@@ el@@ ing kind of hel@@ pl@@ ess .
We look at these pic@@ tures and we understand , for the first time , our ro@@ le in this sup@@ p@@ ly cha@@ in .
We connec@@ t the d@@ ots in the sup@@ p@@ ly cha@@ in .
And we have this kind of — as v@@ ot@@ ers , we have kind of a &quot; &quot; e@@ u@@ re@@ k@@ a ! &quot; &quot; moment .
This is why these mo@@ ments of these oil spi@@ lls are so important .
But it &apos;s also really important that we don &apos;t get dist@@ rac@@ ted by the the@@ ater or the mor@@ als of it .
We actually need to go in and work on the ro@@ ots of the problem .
One of the things that happened with the two pre@@ vi@@ ous oil spi@@ lls was that we really worked on some of the sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms .
We were very reac@@ tive , as op@@ pos@@ ed to being pro@@ ac@@ tive about what happened .
And so what we did was , actually , we made mor@@ atori@@ u@@ ms on the e@@ ast and w@@ est co@@ a@@ sts on dri@@ lling .
We st@@ op@@ ped dri@@ lling in A@@ N@@ W@@ R , but we didn &apos;t actually redu@@ ce the amount of oil that we consu@@ med .
In fact , it &apos;s continu@@ ed to incre@@ ase .
The only thing that really re@@ duc@@ es the amount of oil that we consu@@ me is much high@@ er pri@@ ces .
As you can see , our own produc@@ tion has fal@@ l@@ en off as our res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s have g@@ ot@@ ten old and ex@@ pen@@ sive to dri@@ ll out .
We only have two percent of the world &apos;s oil res@@ er@@ ves ; 6@@ 5 percent of them are in the Per@@ si@@ an G@@ ul@@ f .
One of the things that &apos;s happened because of this is that , sin@@ ce 19@@ 6@@ 9 , the country of N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia , or the part of N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia that pu@@ mp@@ s oil , which is the de@@ l@@ ta — which is two times the size of Mar@@ y@@ land — has had thousands of oil spi@@ lls a year .
I mean , we &apos;ve es@@ senti@@ ally been ex@@ por@@ ting oil spi@@ lls when we im@@ port oil from places without ti@@ ght environ@@ mental regu@@ la@@ tions .
That has been the equi@@ val@@ ent of an Ex@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z sp@@ ill every year sin@@ ce 19@@ 6@@ 9 .
And we can w@@ ra@@ p our he@@ ads around the spi@@ lls , because that &apos;s what we see here , but in fact , these gu@@ ys actually live in a w@@ ar z@@ one .
There &apos;s a thou@@ s@@ and bat@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ rela@@ ted de@@ a@@ ths a year in this are@@ a tw@@ ice the size of Mar@@ y@@ land , and it &apos;s all rela@@ ted to the oil .
And these gu@@ ys , I mean , if they were in the U.@@ S@@ . , they might be actually here in this room .
They have de@@ gre@@ es in poli@@ tical science , de@@ gre@@ es in bus@@ in@@ ess — they &apos;re ent@@ re@@ pren@@ e@@ ur@@ s . They don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
And it &apos;s sort of one of the other g@@ rou@@ ps of people who pa@@ y a pri@@ ce for us .
The other thing that we &apos;ve done , as we &apos;ve continu@@ ed to incre@@ ase de@@ m@@ and , is that we kind of play a sh@@ ell game with the co@@ sts .
One of the places we put in a big oil project in C@@ had , with Ex@@ x@@ on .
So the U.@@ S@@ . ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ er pa@@ id for it ; the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , Ex@@ x@@ on pa@@ id for it .
We put it in . There was a tre@@ men@@ dous ban@@ di@@ try problem .
I was there in 200@@ 3 .
We were dri@@ ving al@@ ong this dar@@ k , dar@@ k ro@@ ad , and the guy in the green ste@@ p@@ ped out , and I was just like , &quot; &quot; A@@ h@@ h@@ h ! This is it . &quot; &quot; And then the guy in the Ex@@ x@@ on uni@@ form ste@@ p@@ ped out , and we realiz@@ ed it was o@@ kay .
They have their own priva@@ te sort of ar@@ my around them at the oil fiel@@ ds .
But at the same time , C@@ had has become much more un@@ sta@@ ble , and we are not pa@@ ying for that pri@@ ce at the pu@@ m@@ p .
We pa@@ y for it in our ta@@ xes on A@@ pri@@ l 1@@ 5@@ th .
We do the same thing with the pri@@ ce of poli@@ c@@ ing the Per@@ si@@ an G@@ ul@@ f and ke@@ e@@ ping the shi@@ p@@ ping lan@@ es open .
This is 19@@ 8@@ 8 — we actually bo@@ m@@ bed two I@@ ran@@ i@@ an oil pla@@ t@@ for@@ ms that year .
That was the beg@@ in@@ ning of an escal@@ ating U.@@ S@@ . invol@@ ve@@ ment there that we do not pa@@ y for at the pu@@ m@@ p .
We pa@@ y for it on A@@ pri@@ l 1@@ 5@@ th , and we can &apos;t even cal@@ cu@@ late the co@@ st of this invol@@ ve@@ ment .
The other place that is sort of sup@@ por@@ ting our depen@@ den@@ ce on oil and our incre@@ a@@ sed consu@@ mp@@ tion is the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ico , which was not part of the mor@@ atori@@ u@@ ms .
Now what &apos;s happened in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ico — as you can see , this is the M@@ in@@ er@@ als Man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment diag@@ ra@@ m of w@@ el@@ ls for gas and oil .
It &apos;s become this inten@@ se industri@@ aliz@@ ed z@@ one .
It doesn &apos;t have the same res@@ on@@ ance for us that the Ar@@ c@@ tic Na@@ tional W@@ il@@ d@@ life Re@@ fu@@ ge has , but it should , I mean , it &apos;s a bir@@ d san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
Al@@ so , every time you bu@@ y ga@@ so@@ line in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes , half of it is actually being re@@ fin@@ ed al@@ ong the co@@ ast , because the G@@ ul@@ f actually has about 50 percent of our re@@ fin@@ ing capaci@@ ty and a lot of our mar@@ ine termin@@ als as well .
So the people of the G@@ ul@@ f have es@@ senti@@ ally been sub@@ si@@ di@@ zing the res@@ t of us through a l@@ es@@ s@@ -@@ c@@ le@@ an environment .
And finally , Ameri@@ can famili@@ es also pa@@ y a pri@@ ce for oil .
Now on the one hand , the pri@@ ce at the pu@@ m@@ p is not really very high when you consi@@ der the actual co@@ st of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other tr@@ an@@ si@@ t op@@ tions means that they pa@@ y a lar@@ ge amount of their in@@ come into just getting back and for@@ th to work , gener@@ ally in a fa@@ ir@@ ly cru@@ m@@ my car .
If you look at people who make $ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three j@@ ob@@ s or more , and then they have to really com@@ mu@@ te .
They &apos;re actually s@@ pen@@ ding more on their car and fu@@ el than they are on ta@@ xes or on health care .
And the same thing happens at the 5@@ 0@@ th per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le , around 8@@ 0@@ ,000 .
G@@ a@@ so@@ line co@@ sts are a tre@@ men@@ dous dra@@ in on the Ameri@@ can econo@@ my , but they &apos;re also a dra@@ in on individu@@ al famili@@ es and it &apos;s kind of terri@@ f@@ ying to think about what happens when pri@@ ces get high@@ er .
So , what I &apos;m going to talk to you about now is : what do we have to do this time ?
What are the la@@ ws ? What do we have to do to keep ourselves fo@@ cu@@ sed ?
One thing is — we need to sta@@ y away from the the@@ ater .
We need to sta@@ y away from the mor@@ atori@@ u@@ ms .
We need to fo@@ c@@ us really back again on the mole@@ cul@@ es .
The mor@@ atori@@ u@@ ms are fin@@ e , but we do need to fo@@ c@@ us on the mole@@ cul@@ es on the oil .
One of the things that we also need to do , is we need to try to not kind of fo@@ ol ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world , before you redu@@ ce the amount of oil that we use .
We need to fo@@ c@@ us on re@@ duc@@ ing the oil .
What you see in this top dra@@ wing is a s@@ che@@ ma@@ tic of how pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um gets used in the U.@@ S@@ . econo@@ my .
It comes in on the side — the u@@ se@@ ful stuff is the dar@@ k gra@@ y , and the un@@ -@@ u@@ se@@ ful stuff , which is called the re@@ jec@@ ted energy — the was@@ te , goes up to the top .
Now you can see that the was@@ te far ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh@@ s the actually u@@ se@@ ful amount .
And one of the things that we need to do is , not only fi@@ x the fu@@ el ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy of our ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les and make them much more ef@@ fici@@ ent , but we also need to fi@@ x the econo@@ my in gener@@ al .
We need to re@@ move the per@@ ver@@ se incen@@ tiv@@ es to use more fu@@ el .
For example , we have an in@@ sur@@ ance system where the person who dri@@ ves 20@@ ,000 miles a year pa@@ ys the same in@@ sur@@ ance as somebody who dri@@ ves 3@@ ,000 .
We actually en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to dri@@ ve more .
We have poli@@ ci@@ es that re@@ ward sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l — we have all kinds of poli@@ ci@@ es .
We need to have more mo@@ bility cho@@ ic@@ es .
We need to make the gas pri@@ ce better ref@@ lec@@ t the real co@@ st of oil .
And we need to shi@@ ft sub@@ si@@ dies from the oil indu@@ stry , which is at le@@ ast 10 billion dollars a year , into something that al@@ lo@@ ws mi@@ d@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cla@@ ss people to find better ways to com@@ mu@@ te .
W@@ he@@ ther that &apos;s getting a much more ef@@ fici@@ ent car and also kind of buil@@ ding mar@@ ke@@ ts for new car@@ s and new fu@@ els down the ro@@ ad , this is where we need to be .
We need to kind of ra@@ tion@@ aliz@@ e this whole thing , and you can find more about this poli@@ cy .
It &apos;s called S@@ T@@ R@@ O@@ N@@ G , which is &quot; &quot; S@@ ec@@ ure T@@ ran@@ s@@ por@@ tation Re@@ duc@@ ing O@@ il Ne@@ e@@ ds Gra@@ du@@ ally , &quot; &quot; and the idea is instead of being hel@@ pl@@ ess , we need to be more st@@ rong .
They &apos;re up at Ne@@ w@@ Ameri@@ ca@@ .@@ ne@@ t@@ .
What &apos;s important about these is that we try to move from fe@@ el@@ ing hel@@ pl@@ ess at the pu@@ m@@ p , to actually being ac@@ tive and to really sort of thinking about who we are , having kind of that spe@@ cial moment , where we connec@@ t the d@@ ots actually at the pu@@ m@@ p .
Now sup@@ pos@@ e@@ d@@ ly , oil ta@@ xes are the th@@ ird ra@@ il of Ameri@@ can poli@@ tics — the no@@ -@@ f@@ ly z@@ one .
I actually — I ag@@ ree that a dol@@ lar a gal@@ l@@ on on oil is probably too much , but I think that if we started this year with three c@@ ents a gal@@ l@@ on on ga@@ so@@ line , and u@@ p@@ ped it to six c@@ ents next year , n@@ ine c@@ ents the fol@@ lo@@ wing year , all the way up to 30 c@@ ents by 20@@ 20 , that we could actually signifi@@ can@@ tly redu@@ ce our ga@@ so@@ line consu@@ mp@@ tion , and at the same time we would give people time to pre@@ par@@ e , time to respon@@ d , and we would be ra@@ is@@ ing money and ra@@ is@@ ing consci@@ ousness at the same time .
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work .
This is a gas rece@@ i@@ pt , hy@@ po@@ the@@ tically , for a year from now .
The first thing that you have on the ta@@ x is — you have a ta@@ x for a st@@ ron@@ ger America — 3@@ 3 c@@ ents .
So you &apos;re not hel@@ pl@@ ess at the pu@@ m@@ p .
And the second thing that you have is a kind of war@@ ning si@@ g@@ n , very similar to what you would find on a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te p@@ ack .
And what it says is , &quot; &quot; The Na@@ tional A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ences esti@@ ma@@ tes that every gal@@ l@@ on of gas you bur@@ n in your car cre@@ ates 2@@ 9 c@@ ents in health care co@@ sts . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a lot .
And so this — you can see that you &apos;re pa@@ ying consider@@ ab@@ ly less than the health care co@@ sts on the ta@@ x .
And also , the hope is that you start to be connec@@ ted to the whole gre@@ ater system .
And at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on com@@ mu@@ ting , or a low@@ -@@ inter@@ est lo@@ an on a different kind of car , or w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it is you &apos;re going to need to actually redu@@ ce your ga@@ so@@ line depen@@ den@@ ce .
W@@ ith this whole sort of su@@ i@@ te of poli@@ ci@@ es , we could actually redu@@ ce our ga@@ so@@ line consu@@ mp@@ tion — or our oil consu@@ mp@@ tion — by 20 percent by 20@@ 20 .
So , three million bar@@ re@@ ls a day .
But in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ on .
We need to keep or min@@ ds on the mole@@ cul@@ es and not get dist@@ rac@@ ted by the the@@ ater , not get dist@@ rac@@ ted by the co@@ gni@@ tive dis@@ son@@ ance of the green pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ties that are out there .
We need to kind of get down and do the g@@ ri@@ tty work of re@@ duc@@ ing our depen@@ den@@ ce u@@ po@@ n this fu@@ el and these mole@@ cul@@ es .
Thank you .

D@@ r. Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , in a 19@@ 6@@ 8 spe@@ ec@@ h where he ref@@ lec@@ ts u@@ po@@ n the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts Mo@@ ve@@ ment , sta@@ tes , &quot; &quot; In the end , we will remember not the words of our en@@ e@@ mi@@ es but the si@@ l@@ ence of our fri@@ ends . &quot; &quot; As a teach@@ er , I &apos;ve inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed this mes@@ sa@@ ge .
E@@ very day , all around us , we see the conse@@ quen@@ ces of si@@ l@@ ence man@@ i@@ f@@ est themselves in the form of dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , viol@@ ence , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de and w@@ ar .
In the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , I ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge my stud@@ ents to ex@@ pl@@ ore the si@@ len@@ ces in their own lives through poe@@ try .
We work together to fi@@ ll those sp@@ aces , to recogni@@ ze them , to name them , to understand that they don &apos;t have to be s@@ our@@ ces of s@@ ha@@ me .
In an ef@@ for@@ t to create a culture within my cla@@ s@@ s@@ room where stud@@ ents feel sa@@ fe shar@@ ing the in@@ ti@@ ma@@ ci@@ es of their own si@@ len@@ ces , I have four co@@ re princi@@ pl@@ es pos@@ ted on the bo@@ ard that si@@ ts in the front of my cla@@ ss , which every stud@@ ent si@@ g@@ ns at the beg@@ in@@ ning of the year : read cri@@ tically , wri@@ te consci@@ ously , spe@@ ak c@@ lear@@ ly , tell your tru@@ th .
And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your tru@@ th .
And I realiz@@ ed that if I was going to ask my stud@@ ents to spe@@ ak up , I was going to have to tell my tru@@ th and be hon@@ est with them about the times where I fa@@ i@@ led to do so .
So I tell them that gro@@ wing up , as a kid in a C@@ a@@ th@@ oli@@ c family in Ne@@ w O@@ r@@ le@@ ans , dur@@ ing L@@ ent I was always ta@@ u@@ ght that the most me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful thing one could do was to give something up , sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce something you ty@@ pic@@ ally in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge in to pro@@ ve to God you understand his san@@ c@@ ti@@ ty .
I &apos;ve given up so@@ da , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s , F@@ ren@@ ch fri@@ es , F@@ ren@@ ch k@@ is@@ ses , and everything in between .
But one year , I ga@@ ve up spe@@ a@@ king .
I fi@@ gu@@ red the most valu@@ able thing I could sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce was my own vo@@ ice , but it was like I ha@@ dn &apos;t realiz@@ ed that I had given that up a long time ago .
I sp@@ ent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to he@@ ar instead of the things they nee@@ ded to , told myself I was@@ n &apos;t me@@ ant to be any@@ one &apos;s consci@@ ence because I still had to figur@@ e out being my own , so sometimes I just w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t say anything , ap@@ pe@@ as@@ ing ig@@ nor@@ ance with my si@@ l@@ ence , un@@ aw@@ are that v@@ ali@@ da@@ tion doesn &apos;t need words to en@@ d@@ or@@ se its exist@@ ence .
When Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an was be@@ at up for being ga@@ y , I put my han@@ ds in my po@@ c@@ ket and wal@@ ked with my head down as if I didn &apos;t even no@@ tice .
I coul@@ dn &apos;t use my lo@@ c@@ ker for wee@@ ks because the bol@@ t on the lo@@ ck re@@ min@@ ded me of the one I had put on my li@@ ps when the ho@@ me@@ less man on the cor@@ ner looked at me with eyes up mer@@ e@@ ly se@@ ar@@ ching for an af@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion that he was wor@@ th see@@ ing .
I was more con@@ cer@@ ned with tou@@ ching the s@@ cre@@ en on my Ap@@ ple than actually fe@@ e@@ ding him one .
When the woman at the fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing gal@@ a said &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so pro@@ u@@ d of you .
It must be so hard teach@@ ing those po@@ or , un@@ inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent kids , &quot; &quot; I bit my li@@ p , because ap@@ par@@ ently we nee@@ ded her money more than my stud@@ ents nee@@ ded their di@@ gn@@ ity .
We s@@ pen@@ d so much time listen@@ ing to the things people are saying that we r@@ are@@ ly pa@@ y attention to the things they don &apos;t .
S@@ il@@ ence is the res@@ i@@ du@@ e of fe@@ ar .
It is fe@@ el@@ ing your f@@ la@@ ws gu@@ t@@ -@@ w@@ ren@@ ch gu@@ ill@@ ot@@ ine your ton@@ gue .
It is the air re@@ tre@@ ating from your ch@@ est because it doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe in your l@@ un@@ gs .
S@@ il@@ ence is R@@ wan@@ dan gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de . S@@ il@@ ence is K@@ a@@ tr@@ ina .
It is what you he@@ ar when there ar@@ en &apos;t enough body b@@ ag@@ s left .
It is the sound after the no@@ ose is already ti@@ ed .
It is char@@ r@@ ing . It is cha@@ ins . It is pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge . It is pa@@ in .
There is no time to pic@@ k your bat@@ t@@ les when your bat@@ t@@ les have already pic@@ ked you .
I will not let si@@ l@@ ence w@@ ra@@ p it@@ self around my in@@ deci@@ sion .
I will tell Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an that he is a li@@ on , a san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary of bra@@ very and bri@@ lli@@ ance .
I will ask that ho@@ me@@ less man what his name is and how his day was , because sometimes all people want to be is human .
I will tell that woman that my stud@@ ents can talk about trans@@ cen@@ d@@ ent@@ al@@ ism like their last name was Th@@ o@@ re@@ a@@ u , and just because you wat@@ ched one e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of &quot; &quot; The W@@ i@@ re &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t mean you know anything about my kids .
So this year , instead of gi@@ ving something up , I will live every day as if there were a micro@@ ph@@ one t@@ uc@@ ked under my ton@@ gue , a sta@@ ge on the under@@ side of my in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
Because who has to have a so@@ ap@@ bo@@ x when all you &apos;ve ever nee@@ ded is your vo@@ ice ?
Thank you .

I think it &apos;s sa@@ fe to say that all human@@ s will be in@@ ti@@ mate with death at le@@ ast on@@ ce in their lives .
But what if that in@@ ti@@ mac@@ y beg@@ an long before you fac@@ ed your own tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion from life into death ?
What would life be like if the de@@ ad liter@@ ally li@@ ved al@@ on@@ g@@ side you ?
In my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s ho@@ me@@ land in the high@@ lan@@ ds of Su@@ la@@ w@@ es@@ i is@@ land in e@@ a@@ ster@@ n In@@ don@@ esi@@ a , there is a commun@@ ity of people that experience death not as a sin@@ gu@@ lar ev@@ ent but as a gra@@ du@@ al social process .
In T@@ ana T@@ or@@ aj@@ a , the most important social mo@@ ments in people &apos;s lives , the fo@@ cal po@@ in@@ ts of social and cul@@ tural interac@@ tion are not we@@ d@@ d@@ ings or bir@@ ths or even family din@@ n@@ ers , but fun@@ er@@ als .
So these fun@@ er@@ als are char@@ ac@@ teri@@ zed by e@@ labor@@ ate ri@@ tu@@ als that ti@@ e people in a system of reci@@ pro@@ cal de@@ b@@ t based on the amount of animals — pi@@ gs , ch@@ ick@@ ens and , most import@@ an@@ tly , water bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o — that are sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced and dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted in the name of the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed .
So this cul@@ tural comple@@ x sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding death , the ri@@ tual en@@ ac@@ t@@ ment of the end of life , has made death the most vi@@ sible and re@@ mar@@ k@@ able as@@ pec@@ t of T@@ or@@ aj@@ a &apos;s lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ing any@@ where from a few days to a few wee@@ ks , fun@@ er@@ al cere@@ mon@@ ies are a ra@@ u@@ co@@ us af@@ fa@@ ir , where com@@ memor@@ ating someone who &apos;s died is not so much a priva@@ te sa@@ d@@ ness but more of a publi@@ c@@ ly shar@@ ed tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion .
And it &apos;s a tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion that &apos;s just as much about the identi@@ ty of the living as it is about re@@ me@@ m@@ br@@ ance of the de@@ ad .
So every year , thousands of visi@@ tors come to T@@ ana T@@ or@@ aj@@ a to see , as it were , this culture of death , and for many people these gran@@ di@@ ose cere@@ mon@@ ies and the l@@ eng@@ th of the cere@@ mon@@ ies are some@@ how in@@ com@@ men@@ su@@ ra@@ ble with the way that we face our own mor@@ tal@@ ity in the W@@ est .
So even as we share death as a univer@@ sa@@ l experience , it &apos;s not experi@@ en@@ ced the same way the world over .
And as an an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , I see these differ@@ ences in experience being roo@@ ted in the cul@@ tural and social world through which we defin@@ e the ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ a around us .
So where we see an un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able re@@ ality , death as an ir@@ re@@ fu@@ table bio@@ logical condi@@ tion , T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans see the ex@@ pi@@ red cor@@ po@@ real form as part of a lar@@ ger social gen@@ esis .
So again , the physical ces@@ sa@@ tion of life is not the same as death .
In fact , a member of socie@@ ty is only tru@@ ly de@@ ad when the ex@@ ten@@ ded family can ag@@ ree u@@ po@@ n and mar@@ s@@ ha@@ l the res@@ our@@ ces neces@@ s@@ ary to h@@ old a fun@@ er@@ al cere@@ mon@@ y that is consider@@ ed appro@@ pri@@ ate in ter@@ ms of res@@ our@@ ces for the sta@@ tu@@ s of the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed .
And this cere@@ mon@@ y has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole commun@@ ity with everyone &apos;s partici@@ pa@@ tion .
So after a person &apos;s physical death , their body is pl@@ ac@@ ed in a spe@@ cial room in the tradi@@ tional res@@ iden@@ ce , which is called the ton@@ g@@ k@@ on@@ an .
And the ton@@ g@@ k@@ on@@ an is sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c not only of the family &apos;s identi@@ ty but also of the human life cy@@ cle from bir@@ th to death .
So es@@ senti@@ ally , the s@@ hap@@ e of the buil@@ ding that you &apos;re bor@@ n into is the s@@ hap@@ e of the struc@@ ture which car@@ ri@@ es you to your an@@ c@@ est@@ ral r@@ esting place .
Un@@ til the fun@@ er@@ al cere@@ mon@@ y , which can be hel@@ d years after a person &apos;s physical death , the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed is re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; &quot; to ma@@ k@@ al@@ a , &quot; &quot; a si@@ ck person , or &quot; &quot; to ma@@ ma , &quot; &quot; a person who is as@@ le@@ ep , and they continu@@ e to be a member of the h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old .
They are sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ cally f@@ ed and car@@ ed for , and the family at this time will beg@@ in a number of ri@@ tual in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tions , which communi@@ ca@@ tes to the wi@@ der commun@@ ity around them that one of their me@@ mb@@ ers is under@@ going the tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion from this life into the af@@ ter@@ life kno@@ wn as P@@ u@@ y@@ a .
So I know what some of you must be thinking right now .
I@@ s she really saying that these people live with the bo@@ dies of their de@@ ad rela@@ tiv@@ es ?
And that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m saying .
But instead of gi@@ ving in to the sort of vis@@ cer@@ al reac@@ tion we have to this idea of pro@@ xi@@ mi@@ ty to bo@@ dies , pro@@ xi@@ mi@@ ty to death , or how this no@@ tion just does not f@@ it into our very bio@@ logical or medical sort of defini@@ tion of death , I like to think about what the T@@ or@@ aj@@ an way of vie@@ wing death en@@ compas@@ ses of the human experience that the medical defini@@ tion lea@@ ves out .
I think that T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans soci@@ ally recogni@@ ze and cul@@ tur@@ ally expres@@ s what many of us feel to be true des@@ pi@@ te the wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce of the bio@@ medical defini@@ tion of death , and that is that our rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps with other human@@ s , their impac@@ t on our social re@@ ality , doesn &apos;t ce@@ ase with the termin@@ ation of the physical pro@@ ces@@ ses of the body , that there &apos;s a peri@@ od of tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion as the rela@@ tion@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad is trans@@ for@@ med but not en@@ ded .
So T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans expres@@ s this idea of this en@@ dur@@ ing rela@@ tion@@ ship by la@@ vi@@ sh@@ ing love and attention on the most vi@@ sible sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of that rela@@ tion@@ ship , the human body .
So my h@@ us@@ b@@ and has fon@@ d memor@@ ies of talking to and pla@@ ying with and gener@@ ally being around his de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther , and for him there is nothing un@@ natural about this .
This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to ter@@ ms with the tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion in their rela@@ tion@@ ship to the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed , and this is the tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion from rela@@ ting to the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed as a person who &apos;s living to rela@@ ting to the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed as a person who &apos;s an an@@ c@@ est@@ or .
And here you can see these w@@ oo@@ den ef@@ fi@@ gi@@ es of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , so these are people who have already been bu@@ ri@@ ed , already had a fun@@ er@@ al cere@@ mon@@ y .
These are called ta@@ u ta@@ u .
So the fun@@ er@@ al cere@@ mon@@ y it@@ self em@@ bo@@ dies this rela@@ tional per@@ spec@@ tive on death .
It ri@@ tu@@ aliz@@ es the impac@@ t of death on famili@@ es and communi@@ ties .
And it &apos;s also a moment of sel@@ f-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
It &apos;s a moment when people think about who they are , their place in socie@@ ty , and their ro@@ le in the life cy@@ cle in ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ance with T@@ or@@ aj@@ an co@@ s@@ mo@@ logy .
There &apos;s a saying in T@@ or@@ aj@@ a that all people will become gran@@ d@@ parents , and what this means is that after death , we all become part of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ral line that an@@ ch@@ ors us between the pa@@ st and the present and will defin@@ e who our lo@@ ved ones are into the future .
So es@@ senti@@ ally , we all become gran@@ d@@ parents to the gener@@ ations of human children that come after us .
And this meta@@ ph@@ or of me@@ m@@ ber@@ ship in the gre@@ ater human family is the way that children also descri@@ be the money that they inv@@ est in these sac@@ ri@@ fici@@ al bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o@@ es that are thought to car@@ ry people &apos;s s@@ ou@@ l from here to the af@@ ter@@ life , and children will ex@@ pla@@ in that they will inv@@ est the money in this because they want to re@@ pa@@ y their parents the de@@ b@@ t for all of the years their parents sp@@ ent inv@@ esting and car@@ ing for them .
But the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o and the ri@@ tual dis@@ play of we@@ al@@ th also ex@@ hi@@ b@@ its the sta@@ tu@@ s of the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed , and , by ex@@ ten@@ sion , the de@@ ce@@ a@@ sed &apos;s family .
So at fun@@ er@@ als , rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps are re@@ con@@ fir@@ med but also trans@@ for@@ med in a ri@@ tual dra@@ ma that high@@ li@@ ghts the most s@@ ali@@ ent fe@@ ature about death in this place : its impac@@ t on life and the rela@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps of the living .
So all of this fo@@ c@@ us on death doesn &apos;t mean that T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans don &apos;t as@@ pi@@ re to the ide@@ al of a long life .
They eng@@ age in many prac@@ tic@@ es thought to con@@ fer good health and sur@@ viv@@ al to an ad@@ van@@ ced age .
But they don &apos;t put much sto@@ ck in ef@@ for@@ ts to pro@@ long life in the face of de@@ bili@@ ta@@ ting ill@@ ness or in old age .
It &apos;s said in T@@ or@@ aj@@ a that every@@ body has sort of a pre@@ determin@@ ed amount of life .
It &apos;s called the s@@ un@@ ga &apos; .
And like a th@@ read , it should be al@@ low@@ ed to un@@ s@@ po@@ ol to its natural end .
So by having death as a part of the cul@@ tural and social f@@ abri@@ c of life , people &apos;s every@@ day deci@@ si@@ ons about their health and health@@ care are af@@ fec@@ ted .
The pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch of my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s ma@@ ter@@ n@@ al cla@@ n , N@@ en@@ et K@@ at@@ c@@ ha , is now appro@@ ach@@ ing the age of 100 , as far as we can tell .
And there are incre@@ as@@ ing si@@ g@@ ns that he is about to de@@ part on his own j@@ our@@ ne@@ y for P@@ u@@ y@@ a .
And his death will be gre@@ at@@ ly m@@ our@@ ned .
But I know that my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s family loo@@ ks for@@ ward to the moment when they can ri@@ tu@@ ally dis@@ play what his re@@ mar@@ k@@ able pres@@ ence has me@@ ant to their lives , when they can ri@@ tu@@ ally re@@ coun@@ t his life &apos;s n@@ arra@@ tive , we@@ a@@ ving his story into the hist@@ ory of their commun@@ ity .
H@@ is story is their story .
H@@ is fun@@ er@@ al son@@ gs will sing them a son@@ g about themselves .
And it &apos;s a story that has no dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble beg@@ in@@ ning , no for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ able end .
It &apos;s a story that goes on long after his body no lon@@ ger does .
People ask me if I &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed or re@@ pul@@ sed by partici@@ pa@@ ting in a culture where the physical man@@ i@@ f@@ esta@@ tions of death gre@@ et us at every turn .
But I see something pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly trans@@ forma@@ tive in experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing death as a social process and not just a bio@@ logical one .
In re@@ ality , the rela@@ tion@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad has its own dra@@ ma in the U.@@ S@@ . health@@ care system , where deci@@ si@@ ons about how long to stre@@ t@@ ch the th@@ read of life are made based on our emo@@ tional and social ties with the people around us , not just on medic@@ ine &apos;s ability to pro@@ long life .
We , like the T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans , base our deci@@ si@@ ons about life on the me@@ an@@ ings and the defini@@ tions that we as@@ cri@@ be to death .
So I &apos;m not su@@ gg@@ esting that any@@ one in this audi@@ ence should r@@ un out and ado@@ pt the tradi@@ tions of the T@@ or@@ aj@@ ans .
It might be a little bit dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t to put into play in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
But I want to ask what we can ga@@ in from see@@ ing physical death not only as a bio@@ logical process but as part of the gre@@ ater human story .
What would it be like to look on the ex@@ pi@@ red human form with love because it &apos;s so in@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely a part of who we all are ?
If we could ex@@ p@@ and our defini@@ tion of death to en@@ compas@@ s life , we could experience death as part of life and per@@ haps face death with something other than fe@@ ar .
Per@@ haps one of the ans@@ w@@ ers to the ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es that are fac@@ ing the U.@@ S@@ . health@@ care system , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in the en@@ d-@@ of@@ -@@ life care , is as simple as a shi@@ ft in per@@ spec@@ tive , and the shi@@ ft in per@@ spec@@ tive in this case would be to look at the social life of every death .
It might help us recogni@@ ze that the way we limi@@ t our conversa@@ tion about death to something that &apos;s medical or bio@@ logical is ref@@ lec@@ tive of a lar@@ ger culture that we all share of a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding death , being af@@ ra@@ id of talking about it .
If we could en@@ ter@@ tain and valu@@ e other kinds of kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge about life , inclu@@ ding other defini@@ tions of death , it has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to change the dis@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons that we have about the end of life .
It could change the way that we di@@ e , but more import@@ an@@ tly , it could trans@@ form the way that we live .
