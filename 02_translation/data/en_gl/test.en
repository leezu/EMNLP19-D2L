It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at the ACLU as the organization &apos;s science advisor .
I really , really loved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged .
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights .
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — super interesting .
But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
So Chris cut right to the chase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biobanking , and ...
oh , there &apos;s this really cool issue , functional MRI and using it for lie detection , and ...
oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; Gene patents ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
&quot; Oh my god ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit .
First , we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene .
Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
Gene patent proponents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t patent the gene in your body , we patented an isolated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated .
And the patents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mutations , without permission of the patent holder .
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
Allowing patent holders , often private companies , to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients .
Consider Abigail , a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome , a serious heart condition that , if left untreated , can result in sudden death .
The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
During that time , Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT .
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not patent eligible .
You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that codes for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
As we delved into this issue , we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years .
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo , the biotech industry had grown up around this practice , and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress , and had gone absolutely nowhere .
So the bottom line : courts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to overturn these patents .
Now , neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
So we set out to build our case .
Now , patent cases tend to be : Company A sues Company B over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
We weren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that .
This was about scientific freedom , medical progress , the rights of patients .
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case — more like a civil rights case .
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation .
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics , a company that &apos;s based in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Myriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes .
Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer .
It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop .
It charged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
It has been estimated that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
Kathleen &apos;s sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family was relieved .
That meant that Eileen &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be tested .
But two years later , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer .
It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result .
Had Eileen received the proper result , Kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t that an invention ?
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts , trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately .
And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
So isolating DNA — it &apos;s like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t patent it , it &apos;s still gold .
And the gold , once it &apos;s extracted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make jewelry out of it for example — still can &apos;t patent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet .
In March 2010 , Judge Sweet issued his opinion — 152 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
In reading the opinion , we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case .
I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
We just could not comprehend how this had happened .
So it turned out , Judge Sweet &apos;s clerk working for him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
He was not just a scientist — he had a PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What an incredible stroke of luck !
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
And here things got really interesting .
First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad &apos;s side .
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office , the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible .
This was a really big deal , totally unexpected .
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases , and it has a reputation for being very , very pro-patent .
So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
And we did .
Sort of .
Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
But the two judges who ruled against us , did so for completely different reasons .
The first one , Judge Lourie , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
Myriad didn &apos;t even argue this , so it came out of the blue .
The other , Judge Moore , said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph , like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses , &quot; wherein this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &apos; Is isolated DNA patentable ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nope .
I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives , and it agreed to hear ours .
The day of the oral argument arrives , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse .
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-discoverer of DNA himself , James Watson , who had submitted a brief to the court , where he referred to gene patenting as &quot; &quot; lunacy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake .
The argument itself was riveting .
Chris argued brilliantly .
But for me , the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA , through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon .
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day , but I could never have anticipated the outcome : nine to zero .
&quot; &quot; A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature , and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated .
And furthermore , Myriad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes .
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad &apos;s .
Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering .
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States .
It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail , Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need .
A few weeks after the court issued its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
A little luck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bridged , the alliances that we created , that made pigs fly .
Thank you .

Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Maybe you &apos;re hunching , crossing your legs , maybe wrapping your ankles .
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and I &apos;m hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life unfolds .
So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States .
Here comes the Prime Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy Cuddy : So a handshake , or the lack of a handshake , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
So what is your body language communicating to me ?
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
So it doesn &apos;t have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent , but do we like that person and how they interacted ?
Even more dramatic , Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates &apos; faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes , and even , let &apos;s go digital , emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation .
If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
So when we think of nonverbals , we think of how we judge others , how they judge us and what the outcomes are .
We tend to forget , though , the other audience that &apos;s influenced by our nonverbals , and that &apos;s ourselves .
We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up .
And this is true across the animal kingdom .
It &apos;s not just limited to primates .
And humans do the same thing . ( Laughter ) So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are .
This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
So when they cross the finish line and they &apos;ve won , it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;ve never seen anyone do it .
They do this .
So the arms up in the V , the chin is slightly lifted .
What do we do when we feel powerless ?
We do exactly the opposite .
We close up . We wrap ourselves up .
We make ourselves small .
We don &apos;t want to bump into the person next to us .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other &apos;s nonverbals .
So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
We do the opposite of them .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals .
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occupy space .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
You see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating , and how well they were participating .
And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attributable to participation .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
So my main collaborator Dana Carney , who &apos;s at Berkeley , and I really wanted to know , can you fake it till you make it ?
Like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question really was , do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves ?
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
So it goes both ways .
When it comes to power , it also goes both ways .
So when you feel powerful , you &apos;re more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that &apos;s hormones . I look at hormones .
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people .
Physiologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
So what does that mean ? When you think about power , people tended to think only about testosterone , because that was about dominance .
But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
Probably not , right ?
You want the person who &apos;s powerful and assertive and dominant , but not very stress reactive , the person who &apos;s laid back .
So we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
&quot; &quot; For two minutes , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; I want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; So this is what we did .
We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment , and these people adopted , for two minutes , either high-power poses or low-power poses , and I &apos;m just going to show you five of the poses , although they took on only two .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
This one has been dubbed the &quot; &quot; Wonder Woman &quot; &quot; by the media .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-power .
When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
So this is what happens .
They come in , they spit into a vial , for two minutes , we say , &quot; &quot; You need to do this or this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t look at pictures of the poses .
We don &apos;t want to prime them with a concept of power .
We want them to be feeling power .
So two minutes they do this .
We then ask them , &quot; &quot; How powerful do you feel ? &quot; &quot; on a series of items , and then we give them an opportunity to gamble , and then we take another saliva sample .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
So this is what we find .
Risk tolerance , which is the gambling , we find that when you are in the high-power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gamble .
When you &apos;re in the low-power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a whopping significant difference .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
From their baseline when they come in , high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase , and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease , and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase .
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and feeling sort of shut down .
And we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
But the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
This is in the lab , it &apos;s this little task , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes .
Where can you actually apply this ?
Which we cared about , of course .
And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
Where are you being evaluated , either by your friends ?
For teenagers , it &apos;s at the lunchroom table .
For some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting .
It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through , was the job interview .
So we published these findings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
( Laughter ) You know , so we were of course horrified , and said , Oh my God , no , that &apos;s not what we meant at all .
For numerous reasons , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
What do you do before you go into a job interview ? You do this .
You &apos;re sitting down . You &apos;re looking at your iPhone — or your Android , not trying to leave anyone out .
You &apos;re looking at your notes , you &apos;re hunching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the bathroom , right ? Do that . Find two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
So we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview .
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
They &apos;re being judged also , and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback , so they look like this .
Imagine this is the person interviewing you .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
People hate this .
It &apos;s what Marianne LaFrance calls &quot; &quot; standing in social quicksand . &quot; &quot; So this really spikes your cortisol .
So this is the job interview we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
They have no idea who &apos;s been posing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of tapes , and they say , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all the high-power posers .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to hire these people .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s driving it ?
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence , like , how well-structured is the speech ?
How good is it ? What are their qualifications ?
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
These kinds of things .
People are bringing their true selves , basically .
They &apos;re bringing themselves .
They bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , residue over them .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
So when I tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; &quot; It feels fake . &quot; &quot; Right ?
So I said , fake it till you make it .
It &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
And that really resonated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
I was thrown from the car .
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward , and I had been withdrawn from college , and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations , which was very traumatic .
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Just , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that &apos;s not going to work out for you . &quot; &quot; So I really struggled with this , and I have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that .
So I felt entirely powerless .
I worked and worked , and I got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
Eventually I graduated from college .
It took me four years longer than my peers , and I convinced someone , my angel advisor , Susan Fiske , to take me on , and so I ended up at Princeton , and I was like , I am not supposed to be here .
That &apos;s it .
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m quitting . &quot; &quot; She was like , &quot; &quot; You are not quitting , because I took a gamble on you , and you &apos;re staying .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my gosh , I &apos;m doing it .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
Five years in grad school , a few years , you know , I &apos;m at Northwestern , I moved to Harvard , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time I had been thinking , &quot; Not supposed to be here . &quot;
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who I had said , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; &quot; came into my office . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
She came in totally defeated , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
And that was the moment for me .
Because two things happened .
One was that I realized , oh my gosh , I don &apos;t feel like that anymore .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , you are ! You are supposed to be here !
And tomorrow you &apos;re going to fake it , you &apos;re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know — ( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . &quot; &quot; You know ? And she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there . ( Laughter ) She comes back to me months later , and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it , she had actually faked it till she became it .
So she had changed .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
Fake it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation , for two minutes , try doing this , in the elevator , in a bathroom stall , at your desk behind closed doors .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Leave that situation feeling like , I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am .
So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power posing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this . ( Laughter ) Give it away . Share it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power .
Give it to them because they can do it in private .
They need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
So get out your pen and paper .
Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people starving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
We have not had an idea .
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
Likewise in communicable diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
And then you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
Yet it would do very little good .
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
This third best one was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
Since then our aid has halved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m all for that .
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
They all come out with very much the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
For your passport , a particular drawer .
If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
And so I want to talk about that .
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
The number should be one .
But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
I ran through the numbers myself .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It definitely hurts !
How did we get here ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
They kept it close to them .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
Now I will tell you a secret .
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
As much as genocide is about killing .
It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust .
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
Once all the missing persons are identified , only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain .
In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
Thank you very much .

There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
It &apos;s awful .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .

I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the basics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shores are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
