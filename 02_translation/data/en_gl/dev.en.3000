( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) I see@@ k re@@ fu@@ ge in Al@@ la@@ h from cur@@ sed Sa@@ tan . In the Na@@ me of Al@@ la@@ h , the most Gra@@ ci@@ ous , the most M@@ er@@ ci@@ ful .
( English ) I was bor@@ n in a mi@@ d@@ dle cla@@ ss family .
My fa@@ ther was five years old when he lost his fa@@ ther , but by the time I was bor@@ n , he was already a bus@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man .
So I gu@@ ess I was the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y one .
My mother had 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es .
F@@ ro@@ m 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
D@@ ay to day , I wat@@ ched wo@@ men being car@@ ri@@ ed to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard .
A@@ t that time , when I fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed my high school , I really wanted to be a doc@@ tor .
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help wo@@ men and children .
So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to uni@@ versi@@ ty .
Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there was@@ n &apos;t a d@@ or@@ mi@@ t@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a resul@@ t , my fa@@ ther s@@ ent me to America .
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
W@@ hi@@ le I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was in@@ va@@ ded by R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I b@@ rou@@ ght my family to America .
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
D@@ ay after day , when I listen@@ ed to the news , when I fol@@ low@@ ed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ a@@ king up .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
I was a profes@@ s@@ or at a uni@@ versi@@ ty .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I was@@ n &apos;t happ@@ y .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in P@@ a@@ k@@ is@@ tan , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
A@@ b@@ out 90 percent of them were wo@@ men and children . Mo@@ st of the men have been k@@ il@@ led or they were in w@@ ar . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ,
when I went da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ ve@@ y , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a wi@@ do@@ w with five to ei@@ ght children si@@ tting there and wee@@ ping and not kno@@ wing what to do .
I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their fa@@ ther and their home , and they are sup@@ por@@ ting the family as a 10@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old , trying to protec@@ t their si@@ s@@ ter and their mother and their children .
So it was a very de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting situ@@ ation .
My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
A@@ t that moment , we talk about mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m .
A@@ t that moment , I fel@@ t , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education chan@@ ged my life .
It trans@@ for@@ med me . It ga@@ ve me sta@@ tu@@ s .
It ga@@ ve me confi@@ den@@ ce . It ga@@ ve me a car@@ e@@ er .
It hel@@ ped me to sup@@ port my family , to br@@ ing my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe .
And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
But do you think it was e@@ as@@ y ?
No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , comple@@ tely .
And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ad@@ ing Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , people were not tru@@ st@@ ing any@@ one .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?
So@@ me@@ body who comes from the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
So@@ me@@ body who got edu@@ ca@@ ted here .
D@@ id they tr@@ ust me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really nee@@ ded to build the tr@@ ust in this commun@@ ity .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed and looked and looked .
I asked .
Fin@@ ally , I found one man .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teach@@ er . &quot;
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y woman , cra@@ z@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a teach@@ er ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my of@@ fer , and on@@ ce I started a cla@@ ss in his com@@ po@@ und , the word s@@ pre@@ ad all over .
In a matter of one year , we had 25 s@@ cho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were gi@@ ving teach@@ er tra@@ in@@ ing . We were tra@@ in@@ ing wo@@ men &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , democra@@ cy , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were gi@@ ving all kinds of tra@@ in@@ ing . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the of@@ fi@@ ce in P@@ es@@ ha@@ w@@ ar , P@@ a@@ k@@ is@@ tan .
All of a su@@ d@@ den , I saw my sta@@ ff run@@ ning to roo@@ ms and lo@@ c@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ un away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a le@@ ad@@ er , what do you do ?
You &apos;re s@@ car@@ ed . You know it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
But as a le@@ ad@@ er , you have to h@@ old it together .
You have to h@@ old it together and show str@@ eng@@ th .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were po@@ ur@@ ing into my of@@ fi@@ ce .
So I invi@@ ted them to the of@@ fi@@ ce .
They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ ban .
They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
( Laughter ) V@@ er@@ y me@@ an@@ -@@ looking people , black clo@@ th@@ es , black tur@@ ban , and they po@@ u@@ r into my of@@ fi@@ ce .
And I invi@@ ted them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ in@@ k te@@ a .
And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very s@@ car@@ y , but I was really s@@ ha@@ king up .
But also I was st@@ rong , h@@ ol@@ ding myself up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I d@@ ress — I d@@ ress from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ j@@ a@@ b .
The only thing you could see , my eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Wh@@ ere is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
We have some stud@@ ents coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , Ho@@ ly B@@ oo@@ k .
And you know , K@@ or@@ an says that if you learn the Ho@@ ly B@@ oo@@ k , the woman , they can be a good wi@@ fe , and they can o@@ be@@ y their h@@ us@@ b@@ and . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started spe@@ a@@ king P@@ as@@ h@@ to .
They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , lea@@ ve her al@@ one , she &apos;s O@@ K . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I of@@ fer@@ ed them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left .
B@@ y that time , my sta@@ ff po@@ u@@ red into my of@@ fi@@ ce .
They were s@@ car@@ ed to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But every@@ body was happ@@ y to see me .
V@@ er@@ y happ@@ y , and I was happ@@ y to be ali@@ ve , of course .
( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happ@@ y to be ali@@ ve .
But also , as we continu@@ ously ga@@ ve tra@@ in@@ ing dur@@ ing the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ ban — of course dur@@ ing the T@@ ali@@ ban there is another story .
We went under@@ ground and we pro@@ vi@@ ded education for 80 s@@ cho@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls , 3@@ ,000 stud@@ ents under@@ ground , and continu@@ ously we tra@@ in@@ ed .
W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ ban , we went into the country , and we op@@ en@@ ed school after school .
We op@@ en@@ ed wo@@ men &apos;s learning cen@@ ter .
We continu@@ ously op@@ en@@ ed c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
We had re@@ produc@@ tive health tra@@ in@@ ing .
We had all kinds of tra@@ in@@ ing that you can imagine .
I was very happ@@ y . I was de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , again , I was st@@ op@@ ped in the mi@@ d@@ dle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men .
R@@ i@@ f@@ les on their sh@@ oul@@ ders , they blo@@ c@@ ked the ro@@ ad .
And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
And by that time , the wo@@ men are y@@ el@@ ling and s@@ crea@@ ming inside the car .
I am very s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it .
This time , we all are going to be k@@ il@@ led .
There is no dou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take str@@ eng@@ th from w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you believe and w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can wal@@ k on it .
So I just h@@ old myself on the side of the car .
My le@@ g was s@@ ha@@ king , and I got out@@ side .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
You tra@@ in wo@@ men , you te@@ ach them and also you give them an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to have a job .
You build their s@@ ki@@ lls . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s O@@ K .
The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re bor@@ n , we just h@@ old the g@@ un and k@@ ill .
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course .
So I wal@@ k out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I si@@ t in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; Tur@@ n around and go back to the of@@ fi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were sup@@ por@@ ting gir@@ ls .
We only had money for wo@@ men to tra@@ in them , to sen@@ d them to school , and nothing else .
B@@ y the time I came to the of@@ fi@@ ce , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were g@@ one .
They ran away home . No@@ body sta@@ y@@ ed there .
My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was comple@@ tely g@@ one .
I was s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?
Because we had tra@@ in@@ ing going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of wo@@ men were there coming to get tra@@ in@@ ing .
So I was si@@ tting there , all of a su@@ d@@ den , at this moment , talking about mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a re@@ port .
And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ k@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tri@@ ed to co@@ ver .
No matter what I tri@@ ed to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
&quot; O@@ K , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I told her the whole story .
A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you go next time , and you will help them .
You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same young men , stan@@ ding up there and h@@ ol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and po@@ in@@ ting to us to stop the car .
So we st@@ op@@ ped the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one condi@@ tion , that w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver I say , you ac@@ cep@@ t it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do .
So I took them to the mos@@ que , and to make a long story sh@@ or@@ t , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
To@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ i@@ des .
E@@ very are@@ a that is un@@ kno@@ wn to us in the moun@@ tain are@@ as , they go with me . They are a@@ head , and we go .
And they protec@@ t us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That te@@ lls you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
When you edu@@ cate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gen@@ der equ@@ ality .
We cannot only tra@@ in wo@@ men but for@@ get about the men , because the men are the real people who are gi@@ ving wo@@ men the har@@ des@@ t time .
( Laughter ) So we started tra@@ in@@ ing men because the men should know the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of wo@@ men , know how much these po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al men has , and how much these wo@@ men can do the same job they are doing .
So we are continu@@ ously gi@@ ving tra@@ in@@ ing to men , and I really believe st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly .
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country .
We were going every@@ where .
W@@ o@@ men were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , eng@@ in@@ e@@ er , teach@@ er , and we were going from house to house .
We never lo@@ c@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
To@@ day , people cannot wal@@ k out of their do@@ or without se@@ curi@@ ty is@@ su@@ es .
But we want the same Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
To@@ day , the wo@@ men of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan are working very , very hard .
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be doc@@ tors , back again .
They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be teachers , and they are run@@ ning bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses .
So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al , and all of this is going to happen .
I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of tr@@ ust and hon@@ est@@ y .
If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh .
We have one po@@ et , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
He said that by having compassion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world .
And I tell you , we could .
And if we could do it in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
Thank you very , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago , I got a ph@@ one call that chan@@ ged my life .
A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ dia@@ c imag@@ ing tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es .
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ mal@@ e ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e had wo@@ ken up with a fa@@ cial dro@@ o@@ p and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a st@@ ro@@ ke .
Now , to be c@@ lear , Nor@@ th Ameri@@ can z@@ o@@ os are sta@@ f@@ f@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ stan@@ ding care of their animal patients .
And this pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ e , which I have done on many human patients , was iden@@ tical , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il .
And oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on ro@@ unds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter and at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ eles Z@@ o@@ o .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very c@@ lear fo@@ c@@ us for me .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were es@@ senti@@ ally taking care of the same dis@@ or@@ ders in their animal and human patients : con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure , brain tu@@ mor@@ s , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , diabe@@ tes , ar@@ th@@ ri@@ ti@@ s , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ mes like depres@@ sion , an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty , comp@@ ul@@ si@@ ons , e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and sel@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
Now , I &apos;ve got a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to make .
E@@ ven though I stu@@ died compar@@ a@@ tive physi@@ o@@ logy and evolu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even wri@@ t@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or th@@ esis on D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an the@@ ory — learning about the signifi@@ can@@ t over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and human@@ s , it came as a much nee@@ ded wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for me .
So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ la@@ ps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ sul@@ t the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?
For that matter , why was any of this a sur@@ pri@@ se ?
I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bio@@ logical connec@@ tion between animals and human@@ s .
E@@ very medi@@ cation that we pres@@ cri@@ be or that we &apos;ve ta@@ ken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our famili@@ es has first been t@@ es@@ ted on an animal .
But there &apos;s something very different about gi@@ ving an animal a medi@@ cation or a human disease and the animal develo@@ ping con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure or diabe@@ tes or bre@@ ast cancer on their own .
Now , maybe some of the sur@@ pri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing separ@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ ban and the n@@ on@@ ur@@ ban .
You know , we he@@ ar about these city kids who think that w@@ ool gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a pl@@ ant .
Well , today &apos;s human ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ lea@@ ming ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als of technology .
And this cre@@ ates a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical dist@@ ance between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and animal patients who are living in oce@@ ans and far@@ ms and j@@ un@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ e@@ per reason .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and scienti@@ sts , we ac@@ cep@@ t inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tu@@ ally that our species , Ho@@ mo sa@@ pi@@ ens , is mer@@ e@@ ly one species , no more uni@@ que or spe@@ cial than any other .
But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t comple@@ tely believe that .
I feel it myself when I &apos;m listen@@ ing to Mo@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mar@@ s R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ oo@@ k .
I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I recogni@@ ze the scienti@@ fi@@ cally i@@ so@@ la@@ ting co@@ st of see@@ ing ourselves as a su@@ peri@@ or species , a@@ part .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the animal doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human animal pati@@ ent ?
Here are a few examp@@ les of the kind of exci@@ ting connec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
It was descri@@ bed in a ga@@ mb@@ ling fa@@ ther who had lost his life &apos;s sa@@ v@@ ings with a ro@@ ll of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter .
But it tur@@ ns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagno@@ sis was ne@@ i@@ ther new , n@@ or was it uni@@ que@@ ly human .
V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diagno@@ sing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing emo@@ tion@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ ke@@ ys to f@@ la@@ m@@ ing@@ os , from to de@@ er to ra@@ b@@ b@@ its , sin@@ ce the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge had been put into the han@@ ds of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
So@@ me human patients har@@ m themselves .
So@@ me animal patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are st@@ al@@ li@@ ons that re@@ peti@@ tively bi@@ te their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effec@@ tive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing sel@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y in their sel@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ ing animals .
S@@ h@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge be put into the han@@ ds of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ a@@ pi@@ sts and parents and patients stru@@ gg@@ ling with sel@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ?
Po@@ st@@ par@@ tu@@ m depres@@ sion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis .
So@@ me@@ times , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , some wo@@ men become depres@@ sed , and sometimes they become seri@@ ously depres@@ sed and even p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic .
They may ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t their ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n , and in some extre@@ me ca@@ ses , even har@@ m the child .
E@@ qu@@ ine ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t the fo@@ al , ref@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to death .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have devi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to de@@ al with this fo@@ al re@@ jec@@ tion sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me that invol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ ci@@ n in the m@@ are .
O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ ci@@ n is the bon@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this le@@ ads to ren@@ e@@ w@@ ed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al .
S@@ h@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t this information be put into the han@@ ds of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m depres@@ sion and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis ?
Well , des@@ pi@@ te all of this pro@@ mi@@ se , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds rema@@ ins lar@@ ge .
To ex@@ pla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty la@@ un@@ dr@@ y .
So@@ me physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about den@@ ti@@ sts and op@@ to@@ me@@ tri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , but maybe especi@@ ally animal doc@@ tors .
O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t realiz@@ e that it is har@@ der to get into ve@@ t school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Ho@@ mo sa@@ pi@@ ens , but ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ mm@@ als , amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds .
So I don &apos;t b@@ la@@ me the ve@@ ts for fe@@ el@@ ing an@@ no@@ y@@ ed by my profes@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
A physi@@ ci@@ an . ( Laughter ) C@@ lo@@ sing the ga@@ p has become a pas@@ sion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through progra@@ ms like D@@ ar@@ w@@ in on R@@ oun@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing animal ex@@ per@@ ts and evolu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logi@@ sts and em@@ be@@ d@@ ding them on our medical te@@ a@@ ms with our inter@@ ns and our res@@ id@@ ents .
And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we br@@ ing medical s@@ cho@@ ols together with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary s@@ cho@@ ols for col@@ labor@@ tive dis@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons of the shar@@ ed dise@@ ases and dis@@ or@@ ders of animal and human patients .
A@@ t Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , partici@@ pan@@ ts learn how tre@@ ating bre@@ ast cancer in a ti@@ ger can help us better tre@@ at bre@@ ast cancer in a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ; how underst@@ an@@ ding po@@ l@@ y@@ cy@@ stic over@@ ies in a H@@ ol@@ ste@@ in co@@ w can help us better take care of a d@@ ance in@@ struc@@ tor with pa@@ in@@ ful peri@@ o@@ ds ; and how better underst@@ an@@ ding the tre@@ at@@ ment of separ@@ ation an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty in a high@@ -@@ str@@ un@@ g S@@ hel@@ ti@@ e can help an an@@ xi@@ ous young child stru@@ gg@@ ling with his first days of school .
In the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes and now inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally , at Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences physi@@ ci@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans ch@@ ec@@ k their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and their pre@@ concep@@ tions at the do@@ or and come together as col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , as pe@@ ers , as doc@@ tors .
Because it tur@@ ns out , some of the best and most human@@ is@@ tic medic@@ ine is being prac@@ tic@@ ed by doc@@ tors wh@@ ose patients ar@@ en &apos;t human .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human pati@@ ent is by pa@@ ying clo@@ se attention to how all the other patients on the plan@@ et live , grow , get si@@ ck and he@@ al .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
Is@@ n &apos;t it n@@ ice ?
( Laughter ) The k@@ ey ph@@ ra@@ se is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; p@@ he@@ w .
I knew nothing about cancer .
Y@@ our life as a comple@@ x human being is re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed by medical data : Y@@ our imag@@ es , your ex@@ a@@ ms , your lab valu@@ es , a li@@ st of medi@@ cin@@ es .
You su@@ d@@ den@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ a@@ king a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start po@@ in@@ ting their f@@ ing@@ ers at your body and your imag@@ es .
People start chan@@ ging as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ lo . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with ques@@ tions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer .
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; ques@@ tions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be crea@@ tive ?
And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to des@@ er@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?
A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good gu@@ ys in all these s@@ cen@@ arios , because they are very profes@@ sion@@ al and de@@ di@@ ca@@ ted to cur@@ ing you .
But they also are very used to having to de@@ al with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lo@@ se the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;
( Laughter ) Th@@ ings are chan@@ ging , but cla@@ s@@ si@@ cally , they ten@@ d to not eng@@ age you in any way to learn about your condi@@ tion , to get your fri@@ ends and family eng@@ ag@@ ed , or sho@@ wing you ways in which you can change your li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le to min@@ imi@@ ze the ris@@ ks of what you &apos;re going through .
But instead , you &apos;re for@@ ced there to wa@@ it in the han@@ ds of a seri@@ es of very profes@@ sion@@ al st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers .
It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common prac@@ tice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
There &apos;s more to me .
A cur@@ e , whi@@ che@@ ver it is , will have to de@@ al with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital aga@@ in@@ st medical ad@@ vi@@ ce .
I was determin@@ ed to change my rela@@ tion@@ ship with the cancer and I was determin@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dra@@ stic as a sur@@ ger@@ y .
I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use se@@ ver@@ al for@@ ms of op@@ en@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ ce technolo@@ gi@@ es and open information in my prac@@ tice .
So my best be@@ t was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be ac@@ ces@@ sed by any@@ one .
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ec@@ h .
( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ t@@ ali@@ an means &quot; &quot; the cur@@ e &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; cur@@ e &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
In our W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ adi@@ ca@@ ting or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from L@@ a@@ ti@@ n countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
O@@ f course , I was interes@@ ted in the op@@ ini@@ ons of doc@@ tors and health@@ care pro@@ vi@@ ders , but I was also interes@@ ted in the cur@@ e of the arti@@ st , of the po@@ et , of the desig@@ ner , of , who kno@@ ws , the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans .
I was interes@@ ted in the social cur@@ e , I was interes@@ ted in the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical cur@@ e , I was interes@@ ted in the spi@@ ri@@ tual cur@@ e , I was interes@@ ted in the emo@@ tional cur@@ e , I was interes@@ ted in any form of cur@@ e .
And , it worked .
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ si@@ te went vi@@ ral .
I rece@@ i@@ ved l@@ ots of media attention from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I qu@@ ick@@ ly rece@@ i@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 con@@ tac@@ ts — e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , social ne@@ t@@ working — most of them were a su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion on how to cur@@ e my cancer , but more of them were about how to cur@@ e myself as a full individu@@ al .
For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , imag@@ es , pic@@ tures , art per@@ for@@ man@@ ces were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
For example , here we see Fran@@ ces@@ ca Fin@@ i in her per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ at@@ ri@@ ck Li@@ ch@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ mor and put it on sal@@ e on Th@@ ing@@ i@@ ver@@ se .
Now you can have my cancer , too !
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is a n@@ ice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
And this was going on — scienti@@ sts , the tradi@@ tional medic@@ ine ex@@ per@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al resear@@ ch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all connec@@ ted with me to give ad@@ vi@@ ce .
W@@ ith all this information and sup@@ port , I was able to form a te@@ am of se@@ ver@@ al neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , tradi@@ tional doc@@ tors , on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with who@@ m I was able to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the information I was rece@@ i@@ ving , which is very important .
And together , we were able to form a stra@@ te@@ gy for my own cur@@ e in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures .
And the cur@@ r@@ ent stra@@ te@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human hist@@ ory , which is quite re@@ mar@@ k@@ able for me .
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the hospital I wanted to sta@@ y in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was sup@@ por@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of who@@ m fel@@ t p@@ ity for me .
E@@ very@@ one fel@@ t like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in hel@@ ping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
What are the out@@ comes ?
I &apos;m fin@@ e , as you can see , pretty fin@@ e .
( Applause ) I had ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent news after the sur@@ ger@@ y — I have — I had a very low@@ -@@ gra@@ de gli@@ o@@ ma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
I have comple@@ tely chan@@ ged my life and my li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the func@@ tional ma@@ p of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to a@@ vo@@ id .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were .
Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people shar@@ ed their stories , their experi@@ ences .
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t us@@ u@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
I &apos;m a sel@@ f-@@ fo@@ un@@ ding , continu@@ ous sta@@ te of trans@@ lation a@@ mon@@ g many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ e@@ ts emo@@ tion and conven@@ tional research me@@ e@@ ts tradi@@ tional research .
&#91; So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and connec@@ ted socie@@ ty wh@@ ose w@@ el@@ l@@ ness really depen@@ ds on the w@@ el@@ l@@ ness of all of its com@@ pon@@ ents .
This global per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is my op@@ en@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ ce cur@@ e for cancer .
( Applause ) .
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I w@@ on &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realiz@@ e there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s w@@ el@@ come M@@ r. J@@ ami@@ re W@@ il@@ li@@ a@@ ms on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ n@@ is@@ s T@@ ra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r. Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ an@@ ds on the pi@@ ano . ( Applause )
So the ban@@ d@@ st@@ and , as we call it , this is an incre@@ di@@ ble space .
It is really a sac@@ red space .
And one of the things that is really sac@@ red about it is that you have no op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to think about the future , or the pa@@ st .
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many deci@@ si@@ ons being made when you wal@@ k on the ban@@ d@@ st@@ and .
We had no idea what k@@ ey we were going to play in .
In the mi@@ d@@ dle , we sort of made our way into a son@@ g called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i B@@ oo@@ m . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s listen@@ ing . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for pro@@ jec@@ ted ideas .
So the idea of a mi@@ sta@@ ke : F@@ ro@@ m the per@@ spec@@ tive of a j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , it &apos;s e@@ asi@@ er to talk about someone else &apos;s mi@@ sta@@ ke .
So the way I per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve a mi@@ sta@@ ke when I &apos;m on the ban@@ d@@ st@@ and — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
The only mi@@ sta@@ ke li@@ es in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mi@@ sta@@ ke &quot; &quot; is an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity in j@@ az@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even descri@@ be what a fun@@ ny n@@ ote would be .
So for example , if I play@@ ed a col@@ or , like we were pla@@ ying on a pal@@ et@@ te , that so@@ un@@ ded like this ...
( Music ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an play@@ ed a n@@ ote — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
Se@@ e , these are all right inside of the col@@ or pal@@ et@@ te .
If you play@@ ed an E@@ .
Se@@ e , these all li@@ e right inside of this gener@@ al emo@@ tional pal@@ et@@ te that we were pa@@ in@@ ting .
If you play@@ ed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ear@@ s , they would per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ et@@ te .
And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this n@@ ote .
And we w@@ on &apos;t reac@@ t to it .
He &apos;ll in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ et@@ te .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tu@@ ally per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
The only way that I would say it was a mi@@ sta@@ ke is in that we didn &apos;t reac@@ t to it .
It was an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this pal@@ et@@ te again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll reac@@ t to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all ac@@ cep@@ t his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he play@@ ed this n@@ ote .
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a me@@ lo@@ dy out of it .
The tex@@ ture chan@@ ged in the dru@@ ms this time .
It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic , a little bit more inten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it .
So there is no mi@@ sta@@ ke .
The only mi@@ sta@@ ke is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individu@@ al mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an is not aw@@ are and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and member to in@@ cor@@ po@@ rate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for crea@@ tivi@@ ty .
So j@@ az@@ z , this ban@@ d@@ st@@ and is absolu@@ tely amazing .
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I spe@@ ak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gran@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the ban@@ d@@ st@@ and and play music is a b@@ l@@ es@@ sing .
So how does this all rela@@ te to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
Well we &apos;re j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , so ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great rela@@ tion@@ ship to fin@@ ance .
( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we han@@ dle it .
And the other dy@@ na@@ mic of it is that we don &apos;t micro@@ man@@ age in j@@ az@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limi@@ ts the arti@@ stic pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ties .
If I come up and I dic@@ ta@@ te to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just j@@ u@@ m@@ p right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m bul@@ l@@ ying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to li@@ ste@@ n .
This is a science of listen@@ ing .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a cer@@ tain level of inten@@ si@@ ty , the first ste@@ p for me is to be pati@@ ent , to li@@ ste@@ n to what &apos;s going on and pul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you eng@@ age and in@@ spi@@ re the other mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds .
W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organi@@ c . It &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
It &apos;s not about bul@@ l@@ ying my vi@@ sion or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and al@@ lo@@ wing crea@@ tivi@@ ty to f@@ low .
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es is to in@@ no@@ va@@ te funda@@ ment@@ ally in education .
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ led to in education .
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incre@@ di@@ ble spe@@ e@@ ches and ideas that are being s@@ pre@@ ad , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward posi@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about tele@@ vi@@ sion .
So most everyone wat@@ ches T@@ V .
We like it . We like some par@@ ts of it .
Here in America , people actually love T@@ V .
The a@@ ver@@ age Ameri@@ can wat@@ ches T@@ V for almost 5 h@@ our@@ s a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in tele@@ vi@@ sion , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
They call it stu@@ pi@@ d , and wor@@ se , believe me .
My mother , gro@@ wing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ o@@ t bo@@ x . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ ba@@ te whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tele@@ vi@@ sion has a consci@@ ence .
So why I believe that tele@@ vi@@ sion has a consci@@ ence is that I actually believe that tele@@ vi@@ sion direc@@ tly ref@@ lec@@ ts the moral , poli@@ tical , social and emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes of our na@@ tion — that tele@@ vi@@ sion is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire valu@@ e system .
So all these things are uni@@ que@@ ly human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of consci@@ ence .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about popu@@ lar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over the course of 50 years .
How do these N@@ i@@ el@@ sen ra@@ t@@ ings ref@@ lec@@ t not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , col@@ lec@@ tive un@@ consci@@ ous , but how do these to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over 50 years ref@@ lec@@ t the idea of our social consci@@ ence ?
How does tele@@ vi@@ sion e@@ vol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our socie@@ ty ?
Now spe@@ a@@ king of evolu@@ tion , from ba@@ sic bio@@ logy , you probably remember that the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , inclu@@ ding human@@ s , have four ba@@ sic pri@@ mal inst@@ inc@@ ts .
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess .
As human@@ s , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve e@@ vol@@ ved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these ba@@ sic animal inst@@ inc@@ ts .
We have the capaci@@ ty to la@@ u@@ gh and cr@@ y .
We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity .
That is separ@@ ate and a@@ part from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ed .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly separ@@ ates us from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch .
So I had an ambi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be underst@@ o@@ od from this uni@@ que@@ ly human rela@@ tion@@ ship between tele@@ vi@@ sion progra@@ ms and the human consci@@ ous .
Why has tele@@ vi@@ sion en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment e@@ vol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this carto@@ on devi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l si@@ tting on our sh@@ oul@@ ders .
I@@ s tele@@ vi@@ sion liter@@ ally func@@ tion@@ ing as our consci@@ ence , temp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?
So to beg@@ in to answer these ques@@ tions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed the to@@ p@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen sho@@ ws every year for 50 years — a thou@@ s@@ and sho@@ ws .
We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 1@@ 8 to 70 , and we asked them how they fel@@ t emo@@ tion@@ ally .
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these sho@@ ws ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you la@@ u@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audi@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S@@ . sa@@ mp@@ le .
But as you can see , these emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes are tru@@ ly univer@@ sa@@ l .
And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.@@ S@@ . &apos; s most popu@@ lar sho@@ ws are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world .
So I really hope our global audi@@ ences can rela@@ te .
T@@ w@@ o ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : For in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of consci@@ ence and the tri@@ c@@ ks that consci@@ ence can play on us on a da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y ra@@ b@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED commun@@ ity super@@ s@@ tar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study .
T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion sta@@ te and the moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity sta@@ te , which , for this pur@@ pos@@ e , we defin@@ ed in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion as tele@@ vi@@ sion sho@@ ws that u@@ pli@@ ft me , that make me feel much more posi@@ tive about the world .
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity are tele@@ visi@@ ons sho@@ ws in which I don &apos;t understand the differ@@ ence between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is h@@ ol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to cli@@ m@@ b .
R@@ ight at the end of the 6@@ 0@@ s , moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is kind of on the wan@@ e .
Why ?
The C@@ u@@ ban M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts mo@@ ve@@ ment , race ri@@ ots , the Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ a@@ ter@@ ga@@ te .
L@@ oo@@ k what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ts .
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
They cro@@ ss , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a tele@@ gen@@ ic pres@@ id@@ ent , is in of@@ fi@@ ce .
It &apos;s trying to reco@@ ver .
But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ er disa@@ s@@ ter , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l .
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the do@@ min@@ ant me@@ me in tele@@ vi@@ sion from 19@@ 90 for the next 20 years .
Ta@@ ke a look at this .
This char@@ t is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very similar tr@@ end .
But in this case , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in blue and green .
Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ anza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have do@@ mes@@ tic sho@@ ws all about com@@ for@@ t .
This is ri@@ sing . Co@@ m@@ for@@ t sta@@ ys whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y is all of a su@@ d@@ den spi@@ king up .
You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens .
You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y , not only bat@@ t@@ ling it out in our socie@@ ty , but you liter@@ ally have two esta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ment sho@@ ws — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ o@@ m@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ th@@ ree@@ -@@ ra@@ ted tele@@ vi@@ sion sho@@ ws .
What &apos;s number one ?
The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; R@@ o@@ w@@ an and Mar@@ ti@@ n &apos;s Lau@@ gh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Vi@@ e@@ w@@ ers had respon@@ ded dra@@ ma@@ tically .
L@@ oo@@ k at this green spi@@ ke in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show .
When you gu@@ ys he@@ ar this indu@@ stry ter@@ m , a bre@@ a@@ k@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?
It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where .
This was the first show that al@@ low@@ ed vie@@ w@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , about the pres@@ iden@@ cy , through tele@@ vi@@ sion ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ a@@ k@@ out show .
So then , just like the last char@@ t , look what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , the da@@ m bur@@ sts . The da@@ m bur@@ sts .
Co@@ m@@ for@@ t is no lon@@ ger why we wat@@ ch tele@@ vi@@ sion .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se throu@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0@@ s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0@@ s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ ami@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and Son , &quot; &quot; and the do@@ min@@ ant show — in the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0@@ s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;
In the entire 50 years of tele@@ vi@@ sion that we stu@@ died , se@@ ven of 10 sho@@ ws ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed on air dur@@ ing the Vi@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , five of the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 dur@@ ing the N@@ ix@@ on ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very sa@@ v@@ v@@ y cro@@ w@@ d , I also want to n@@ ote the di@@ gi@@ tal fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive .
Ar@@ chi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his e@@ as@@ y cha@@ ir al@@ ong with the res@@ t of us 40 years ago .
This is a qu@@ ick char@@ t . Here &apos;s another at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te : fan@@ tas@@ y and imag@@ in@@ ation , which are sho@@ ws defin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day re@@ al@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ma@@ p@@ ped aga@@ in@@ st the red do@@ t , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , which is a simple B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ par@@ t@@ ment sta@@ ti@@ stic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fan@@ tas@@ y and imag@@ in@@ ation sho@@ ws ri@@ se , it ma@@ ps to a spi@@ ke in un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
D@@ o we want to see sho@@ ws about people sa@@ ving money and being un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ?
No . In the 7@@ 0@@ s you have the be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The B@@ i@@ on@@ ic W@@ o@@ man &quot; &quot; that ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted into the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , fol@@ low@@ ed by the &quot; &quot; S@@ i@@ x M@@ il@@ li@@ on-@@ D@@ ol@@ lar M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther spi@@ ke in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s — another spi@@ ke in sho@@ ws about control and power .
What were those sho@@ ws ?
G@@ la@@ mor@@ ous and ri@@ ch .
&quot; D@@ al@@ las , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ tas@@ y Is@@ land . &quot;
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble ma@@ p@@ ping of our national p@@ sy@@ che with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
So here you are , in my fav@@ ori@@ te char@@ t , because this is our last 20 years .
W@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my bus@@ in@@ ess , you have su@@ re@@ ly heard or read of the de@@ c@@ line of the thing called the th@@ ree@@ -@@ cam@@ era si@@ t@@ co@@ m and the ri@@ se of re@@ ality T@@ V .
Well , as we say in the bus@@ in@@ ess , X mar@@ ks the s@@ po@@ t .
The 9@@ 0@@ s — the big bu@@ b@@ bles of hu@@ mor — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ra@@ si@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing &apos;s good , low un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
But look : X mar@@ ks the s@@ po@@ t .
In 200@@ 1 , the Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 1 tele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on , hu@@ mor suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ s to j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment on@@ ce and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tion decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ st@@ ing of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 1@@ 1 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social le@@ xi@@ con .
L@@ oo@@ k what happens when we keep going .
A@@ t the turn of the cent@@ ur@@ y , the Internet takes off , re@@ ality tele@@ vi@@ sion has ta@@ ken h@@ old .
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
Gi@@ ve me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is fal@@ ling a@@ part .
No , they want j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment .
I can v@@ ote you off the is@@ land .
I can keep S@@ ar@@ ah P@@ al@@ in &apos;s da@@ u@@ ghter dan@@ c@@ ing .
I can cho@@ ose the next Ameri@@ can I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dra@@ ma@@ tically different as these tele@@ vi@@ sion sho@@ ws , p@@ ure en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one ba@@ sic inst@@ inc@@ t rema@@ ins .
We &apos;re animals , we need our mo@@ ms .
There has not been a deca@@ de of tele@@ vi@@ sion without a defini@@ tive , do@@ min@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m .
The 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s : J@@ un@@ e C@@ le@@ ever in the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al com@@ for@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; L@@ u@@ ci@@ lle B@@ all ke@@ pt us la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing through the ri@@ se of social consci@@ ousness in the 6@@ 0@@ s .
M@@ au@@ de Fin@@ d@@ la@@ y , the e@@ p@@ it@@ o@@ me of the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s , who tac@@ k@@ led ab@@ or@@ tion , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce , even men@@ o@@ pa@@ use on T@@ V .
The 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of A@@ le@@ x@@ is Car@@ r@@ ing@@ ton .
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y B@@ ro@@ wn took on a vi@@ ce pres@@ id@@ ent when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od .
This era &apos;s mo@@ m , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devi@@ l or the an@@ ge@@ l si@@ tting on our consci@@ ence , si@@ tting on tele@@ vi@@ sion &apos;s sh@@ oul@@ ders , but I do know that I absolu@@ tely love this ima@@ ge .
So to you all , the wo@@ men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the global audi@@ ences of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the consci@@ ence of tele@@ vi@@ sion .
But let me also th@@ ank the incre@@ di@@ ble cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tele@@ vi@@ sion s@@ cre@@ ens throu@@ gh@@ out all these ages of tele@@ vi@@ sion .
They give it life on tele@@ vi@@ sion , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ w@@ ers , through your col@@ lec@@ tive social consci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , power or not .
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .

In 19@@ 9@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and I me@@ t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was den@@ i@@ ed ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realiz@@ ed that for the hundre@@ ds of le@@ t@@ ters I had wri@@ t@@ ten for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers , that I would never have wri@@ t@@ ten a le@@ tter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body .
He was not a poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y who had st@@ ol@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
What I also realiz@@ ed at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develo@@ ping countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pas@@ sed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red .
And what I recogni@@ zed was that there was an incre@@ di@@ ble win@@ do@@ w of op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for us as a world commun@@ ity to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol .
We of@@ ten think of tor@@ ture as being poli@@ tical tor@@ ture or res@@ er@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers .
It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down le@@ g@@ al syste@@ ms , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of investi@@ ga@@ tion — it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than having a le@@ g@@ al system , che@@ ap@@ er than having a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world commun@@ ity , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will re@@ qui@@ re three things .
F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ in@@ ing , em@@ power@@ ment , and connec@@ tion of defen@@ ders wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syste@@ ma@@ tic early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the th@@ ird is com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment .
So in the year 2@@ 000 , I beg@@ an to won@@ der , what if we came together ?
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I fo@@ un@@ ded Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tice which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of en@@ ding tor@@ ture as an investi@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol and imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by pl@@ ac@@ ing tra@@ in@@ ed la@@ w@@ y@@ ers at an early sta@@ ge in poli@@ ce sta@@ tions and in cour@@ tro@@ o@@ ms .
My first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 19@@ 9@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge had k@@ il@@ led them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers in the country , so conse@@ qu@@ ently you &apos;d wal@@ k into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et wo@@ men and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ men would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w .
The first gro@@ up of defen@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ in@@ ing , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investi@@ ga@@ tion ? &quot;
And there was si@@ l@@ ence in the cla@@ ss , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defen@@ ded more than a hundre@@ d people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investi@@ ga@@ tion , because they all come with con@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a cla@@ ss , the fact that number one , the con@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to keep doing this , especi@@ ally as it was now aga@@ in@@ st the la@@ w .
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these defen@@ ders to deci@@ de that they would beg@@ in to st@@ and up and sup@@ port each other in imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting these la@@ ws .
And I still remember the first ca@@ ses where they came , all 25 together , she would st@@ and up , and they were in the back , and they would sup@@ port her , and the j@@ ud@@ ges ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exac@@ t same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfec@@ t case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table se@@ ll@@ er , she was si@@ tting out@@ side of a house .
She said she actually saw the person r@@ un out who she thin@@ ks sto@@ le w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
And when they b@@ rou@@ ght her case to the j@@ ud@@ ge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , there &apos;s no evi@@ den@@ ce ex@@ cep@@ t for your tor@@ ture con@@ f@@ es@@ sion and you will be re@@ lea@@ sed . &quot; &quot; And the defen@@ ders beg@@ an to take ca@@ ses over and over again and you will see , they have ste@@ p by ste@@ p beg@@ an to change the course of hist@@ ory in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia .
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia is not al@@ one .
I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ?
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In B@@ ur@@ un@@ di I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it was@@ n &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one .
O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really cu@@ te bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It was@@ n &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was ac@@ cu@@ sed of ste@@ al@@ ing two dia@@ per@@ s and an ir@@ on for her bab@@ y and still had been in pri@@ son .
And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son direc@@ tor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A j@@ ud@@ ge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . E@@ i@@ gh@@ ty percent of the two thou@@ s@@ and people here are without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ y@@ ers beg@@ an to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously st@@ and up together to organi@@ ze a system where they can take ca@@ ses .
But we realiz@@ ed that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ in@@ ing of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but the connec@@ tion of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers that makes a differ@@ ence .
For example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go al@@ one but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in Ch@@ ina , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the des@@ er@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where every@@ body sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , ei@@ ght years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ in@@ ing together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mu@@ mb@@ ling
and gru@@ mb@@ ling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create j@@ us@@ tice because we do not have the res@@ our@@ ces . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of res@@ our@@ ces is never an ex@@ c@@ use for in@@ j@@ us@@ tice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly organi@@ zed 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers who have been syste@@ ma@@ tically taking the ca@@ ses .
The k@@ ey that we see , though , is tra@@ in@@ ing and then early ac@@ cess .
I was rec@@ ently in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , and was in@@ spi@@ red to me@@ et with another gro@@ up of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the st@@ ree@@ ts now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ volu@@ tion . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing every@@ body all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of dollars that have rec@@ ently g@@ one in to the develo@@ p@@ ment of the le@@ g@@ al system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I me@@ t with one of the develo@@ p@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ in@@ ing pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and j@@ ud@@ ges , which is the normal bi@@ as , as op@@ pos@@ ed to defen@@ ders .
And they sho@@ w@@ ed me a man@@ u@@ al which actually was an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent man@@ u@@ al .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na co@@ p@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the poli@@ ce sta@@ tion . It was perfec@@ t .
Pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors were perfec@@ tly tra@@ in@@ ed .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that every@@ body got to the pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pa@@ use , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;
So the pi@@ eces are , not only the tra@@ in@@ ing of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to syste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it so@@ unds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it so@@ unds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it so@@ unds big .
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mi@@ rac@@ les because of their com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment .
It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but defen@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pi@@ eces .
We have a progra@@ m called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ Ma@@ kers , and we realiz@@ ed there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we sup@@ port them ?
So it &apos;s an on@@ line cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thou@@ s@@ and dollars if you come up with and in@@ no@@ va@@ tive way of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting j@@ us@@ tice .
And there are 30 J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ Ma@@ kers throu@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thou@@ s@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S progra@@ ms , through par@@ al@@ e@@ g@@ al progra@@ ms , through w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ Ma@@ kers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figur@@ e out who their ne@@ t@@ works are and how they can move it for@@ ward .
So in Ch@@ ina , for inst@@ ance , great la@@ ws came out where it says poli@@ ce cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be pun@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
And I was si@@ tting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted ?
This is fan@@ ta@@ stic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figur@@ e it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ec@@ e@@ mber 4 , he organi@@ zed three thou@@ s@@ and me@@ mb@@ ers of the Y@@ outh Co@@ m@@ mun@@ ist Le@@ a@@ gue , from 1@@ 4 of the top la@@ w s@@ cho@@ ols , who organi@@ zed themselves , developed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the poli@@ ce sta@@ tions and beg@@ an what he says is a n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent le@@ g@@ al re@@ volu@@ tion to protec@@ t ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ ghts .
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and sup@@ port defen@@ ders .
We need to syste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the th@@ ird and most important thing is that we make a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to this .
And people of@@ ten say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ d@@ ly ide@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end apar@@ the@@ id .
It beg@@ an with a small gro@@ up of people who decided they would com@@ mi@@ t .
Now , there &apos;s one of our fav@@ ori@@ te poe@@ ms from the defen@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke cou@@ ra@@ ge fri@@ ends , the ro@@ ad is of@@ ten long , the pa@@ th is never c@@ lear , and the sta@@ kes are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not al@@ one . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world commun@@ ity to sup@@ port not only defen@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ war@@ ds it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the ques@@ tions are — and I &apos;d be happ@@ y to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would lea@@ ve you with the story of V@@ is@@ h@@ na , who actually was my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion for star@@ ting Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tice .
V@@ is@@ h@@ na was a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y when I me@@ t him who was bor@@ n in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ an@@ da@@ l Pro@@ vin@@ ce . But because he was bor@@ n in the pri@@ son , every@@ body lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was al@@ low@@ ed to come in and out of the bar@@ s .
So , you know , there &apos;s bar@@ s . And by the time that V@@ is@@ h@@ na was getting bi@@ gg@@ er , which means what gets bi@@ gg@@ er ? Y@@ our head gets bi@@ gg@@ er .
So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the th@@ ird b@@ ar , and then really s@@ low@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , th@@ ird , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visi@@ t .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visi@@ t all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pri@@ son@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his f@@ ing@@ ers through .
O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like ir@@ on cor@@ ru@@ ga@@ ted , and he would put his f@@ ing@@ ers through .
And most of the pri@@ son@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ at@@ est jo@@ y and their s@@ un@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked for@@ ward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ is@@ h@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -old bo@@ y .
He was bor@@ n in a pri@@ son with almost nothing , no material go@@ o@@ ds , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , which I believe we are all bor@@ n into . He said , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ bab@@ ly I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic imag@@ in@@ ation to imagine the s@@ hap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and invi@@ te you into this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with us .
Thank you .

So@@ me people think that there &apos;s a TED Tal@@ k for@@ mul@@ a : &quot; Gi@@ ve a talk on a ro@@ und , red ru@@ g . &quot;

No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Tal@@ k .
In fact , if you over@@ use those devi@@ ces , you &apos;re just going to come across as cli@@ ch@@ é@@ d or emo@@ tion@@ ally man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tive .
I &apos;ve hel@@ ped them pre@@ par@@ e their tal@@ ks for pri@@ me time , and learned direc@@ tly from them their se@@ cre@@ ts of what makes for a great talk .
And even though these spe@@ a@@ kers and their to@@ pic@@ s all see@@ m comple@@ tely different , they actually do have one k@@ ey common ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent .
And it &apos;s this : Y@@ our number one tas@@ k as a spe@@ a@@ ker is to trans@@ fer into your listen@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds an extraordin@@ ary gi@@ ft — a st@@ ran@@ ge and beautiful ob@@ ject that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .

And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re fe@@ el@@ ing the same emo@@ tions .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are bi@@ llions of inter@@ connec@@ ted neurons in an im@@ possible tan@@ g@@ le .
But look here , right here — a few million of them are lin@@ ked to each other in a way which repres@@ ents a single idea .
That &apos;s right ; in just a few minu@@ tes , a pa@@ tter@@ n invol@@ ving mi@@ llions of neurons is being tele@@ por@@ ted into 1@@ ,@@ 200 min@@ ds , just by people listen@@ ing to a vo@@ ice and wat@@ ching a face .
But wa@@ it — what is an idea any@@ way ?
Well , you can think of it as a pa@@ tter@@ n of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ vi@@ ga@@ te the world .
I@@ de@@ as come in all s@@ hap@@ es and si@@ z@@ es , from the comple@@ x and anal@@ y@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic .
Here are just a few examp@@ les shar@@ ed from the TED sta@@ ge .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — crea@@ tivi@@ ty is k@@ ey to our kids &apos; future .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy — buil@@ ding from ba@@ m@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s st@@ rong , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ resist@@ ant .
C@@ A : C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single identi@@ ty .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story cre@@ ates ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes , and the problem with ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ comple@@ te .
C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly .
They &apos;re car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly lin@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ lec@@ tively they form an ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly comple@@ x struc@@ ture that is your person@@ al wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ ga@@ te the world .
And it is buil@@ t up out of mi@@ llions of individu@@ al ideas .
So , for example , if one little com@@ pon@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w is the idea that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll reac@@ t like this .
But if another com@@ pon@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w is the idea that le@@ o@@ par@@ ds are dan@@ ger@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll reac@@ t a little bit differ@@ ently .
So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w are cru@@ cial .
You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the s@@ car@@ y but wonderful real world out there .
Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ ws can be dra@@ ma@@ tically different .
For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w reac@@ t when you see this ima@@ ge : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ali@@ a Mo@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ex@@ per@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ s@@ ter &quot; &quot; ?
O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ was@@ h@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist &quot; &quot; ?
C@@ A : W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver your answer , there are mi@@ llions of people out there who would reac@@ t very differ@@ ently .
If communi@@ ca@@ ted pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chan@@ ging , fo@@ re@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and s@@ hap@@ ing their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future .
I@@ de@@ as are the most power@@ ful for@@ ce s@@ hap@@ ing human culture .
So if you ac@@ cep@@ t that your number one tas@@ k as a spe@@ a@@ ker is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your audi@@ ence , here are four gu@@ ide@@ lin@@ es for how you should go about that tas@@ k : One , limi@@ t your talk to just one ma@@ j@@ or idea .
I@@ de@@ as are comple@@ x things ; you need to s@@ la@@ sh back your cont@@ ent so that you can fo@@ c@@ us on the single idea you &apos;re most pas@@ sion@@ ate about , and give yourself a chan@@ ce to ex@@ pla@@ in that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly .
You have to give con@@ text , share examp@@ les , make it vi@@ vi@@ d .
So pic@@ k one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line run@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way .
T@@ w@@ o , give your listen@@ ers a reason to care .
Be@@ fore you can start buil@@ ding things inside the min@@ ds of your audi@@ ence , you have to get their permi@@ s@@ sion to w@@ el@@ come you in .
And the ma@@ in to@@ ol to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
S@@ tir your audi@@ ence &apos;s curi@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , provo@@ ca@@ tive ques@@ tions to identi@@ f@@ y why something doesn &apos;t make sense and nee@@ ds ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing .
If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ connec@@ tion in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ga@@ p .
And on@@ ce you &apos;ve s@@ par@@ ked that des@@ i@@ re , it will be so much e@@ asi@@ er to start buil@@ ding your idea .
Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concep@@ ts that your audi@@ ence already underst@@ an@@ ds .
You use the power of language to we@@ a@@ ve together concep@@ ts that already exis@@ t in your listen@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language .
You start where they are .
The spe@@ a@@ kers of@@ ten for@@ get that many of the ter@@ ms and concep@@ ts they live with are comple@@ tely un@@ famili@@ ar to their audi@@ ences .
Now , meta@@ ph@@ ors can play a cru@@ cial ro@@ le in sho@@ wing how the pi@@ eces f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the des@@ i@@ red s@@ hap@@ e of the pa@@ tter@@ n , based on an idea that the listen@@ er already underst@@ an@@ ds .
For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to ex@@ pla@@ in the incre@@ di@@ ble new bio@@ technology called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word pro@@ ces@@ s@@ or to edi@@ t DNA .
C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R al@@ lo@@ ws you to c@@ ut and pas@@ te genetic information really e@@ asi@@ ly . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that de@@ li@@ ver@@ s a sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying a@@ ha moment as it s@@ na@@ ps into place in our min@@ ds .
It &apos;s important , ther@@ e@@ fore , to test your talk on tr@@ us@@ ted fri@@ ends , and find out which par@@ ts they get con@@ fu@@ sed by .
F@@ our , here &apos;s the final ti@@ p : Ma@@ ke your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing .
B@@ y that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea ben@@ ef@@ it ? &quot;
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organi@@ z@@ ation , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th shar@@ ing .
The audi@@ ence will see right through you .
But if you believe that the idea has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to bri@@ gh@@ ten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s per@@ spec@@ tive for the better or in@@ spi@@ re someone to do something differ@@ ently , then you have the co@@ re ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent to a tru@@ ly great talk , one that can be a gi@@ ft to them and to all of us .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we he@@ ar .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying mun@@ dan@@ e so@@ unds .
This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er .
Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life .
So , imagine you &apos;re stan@@ ding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , well , this is O@@ ak S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of that blo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blo@@ c@@ ks don &apos;t have na@@ mes .
S@@ tre@@ e@@ ts have na@@ mes ; blo@@ c@@ ks are just the un@@ na@@ med sp@@ aces in between st@@ ree@@ ts . &quot; &quot; He lea@@ ves , a little con@@ fu@@ sed and disa@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted .
So , now imagine you &apos;re stan@@ ding on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in J@@ ap@@ an , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , st@@ ree@@ ts don &apos;t have na@@ mes .
B@@ lo@@ c@@ ks have na@@ mes .
J@@ ust look at Goog@@ le M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 4 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 .
All of these blo@@ c@@ ks have na@@ mes , and the st@@ ree@@ ts are just the un@@ na@@ med sp@@ aces in between the blo@@ c@@ ks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , e@@ as@@ y , this is D@@ ist@@ ri@@ c@@ t E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the house nu@@ mb@@ ers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were buil@@ t .
The first house ever buil@@ t on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever buil@@ t is house number two .
Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s e@@ as@@ y . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ posi@@ te side of the world to realiz@@ e as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realiz@@ e that the op@@ posi@@ te of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in Ch@@ ina who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you health@@ y .
So , any mon@@ th you are health@@ y you pa@@ y them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to pa@@ y them because they fa@@ i@@ led at their job . They get ri@@ ch when you &apos;re health@@ y , not si@@ ck .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beg@@ in@@ ning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four .
But in W@@ est A@@ fri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the peri@@ od at the end of a s@@ ent@@ ence .
So , you can he@@ ar it not just in the ph@@ ra@@ sing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cu@@ rate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver true thing you can say about In@@ dia , the op@@ posi@@ te is also true .
So , let &apos;s never for@@ get , whether at TED , or any@@ where else , that w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver bri@@ lli@@ ant ideas you have or he@@ ar , that the op@@ posi@@ te may also be true .
D@@ o@@ mo ari@@ ga@@ to go@@ z@@ a@@ ima@@ sh@@ ita .
