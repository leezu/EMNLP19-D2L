It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organi@@ z@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was fe@@ el@@ ing just a little bit dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged .
So I wan@@ der@@ ed down the hall@@ way to my col@@ lea@@ gue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce .
Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had de@@ ep institu@@ tional kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and in@@ si@@ ghts .
I ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was fe@@ el@@ ing a little bit st@@ uc@@ k .
I had been investi@@ g@@ ating a number of is@@ su@@ es at the inter@@ sec@@ tion of science and ci@@ vi@@ l liber@@ ties — su@@ per interesting .
But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to eng@@ age these is@@ su@@ es in a much bi@@ gg@@ er way , in a way that could really make a differ@@ ence .
So Ch@@ r@@ is c@@ ut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the is@@ su@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive technolo@@ gi@@ es , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ...
oh , there &apos;s this really co@@ ol is@@ su@@ e , func@@ tional M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e detec@@ tion , and ...
oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene pa@@ t@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pa@@ t@@ ents ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ es , you know , pa@@ t@@ ents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been is@@ su@@ ing pa@@ t@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my of@@ fi@@ ce and s@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ is three ar@@ tic@@ les .
And 20 minu@@ tes later , he came bur@@ st@@ ing in my of@@ fi@@ ce .
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we su@@ e ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really bri@@ lli@@ ant la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but he knew almost nothing about pa@@ t@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gene@@ tics .
I knew something about gene@@ tics , but I was@@ n &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , let al@@ one a pa@@ t@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
F@@ ir@@ st , we nee@@ ded to understand exactly what was pa@@ ten@@ ted when someone pa@@ ten@@ ted a gene .
G@@ en@@ e pa@@ t@@ ents ty@@ pic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ z@@ ens of cla@@ im@@ s , but the most contro@@ versi@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA &quot; &quot; — na@@ me@@ ly , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a cell .
G@@ en@@ e pa@@ t@@ ent pro@@ pon@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; Se@@ e ? We didn &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent the gene in your body , we pa@@ ten@@ ted an i@@ so@@ la@@ ted gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es that it be i@@ so@@ la@@ ted .
And the pa@@ t@@ ents wer@@ en &apos;t just to a particular gene that they i@@ so@@ la@@ ted , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doc@@ tor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ ta@@ tions , without permi@@ s@@ sion of the pa@@ t@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der .
It also means that the pa@@ t@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gene in research or c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal t@@ esting .
Al@@ lo@@ wing pa@@ t@@ ent h@@ ol@@ ders , of@@ ten priva@@ te comp@@ ani@@ es , to lo@@ ck up stre@@ t@@ ches of the human gen@@ o@@ me was har@@ ming patients .
Con@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 10@@ -@@ year@@ -old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , a seri@@ ous heart condi@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can resul@@ t in su@@ d@@ den death .
The comp@@ any that ob@@ tain@@ ed a pa@@ t@@ ent on two genes as@@ soci@@ ated with this condi@@ tion developed a test to diagno@@ se the sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never of@@ fer@@ ed it .
D@@ ur@@ ing that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il died of un@@ diagno@@ sed long Q@@ T .
G@@ en@@ e pa@@ t@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge them ?
Tur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made c@@ lear through a long line of ca@@ ses , that cer@@ tain things are not pa@@ t@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble .
You can &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent produc@@ ts of n@@ ature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , ele@@ ments of the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
And you can &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent la@@ ws of n@@ ature — the la@@ w of gra@@ vi@@ ty , E = m@@ c@@ 2 .
It see@@ med to us that DNA , the most funda@@ mental struc@@ ture of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prote@@ ins , is both a produc@@ t of n@@ ature and a la@@ w of n@@ ature , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or si@@ tting in the bot@@ to@@ m of a test tu@@ be .
As we de@@ l@@ ved into this is@@ su@@ e , we tra@@ ve@@ led all over the country to spe@@ ak with many different ex@@ per@@ ts — scienti@@ sts , medical profes@@ sion@@ als , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , pa@@ t@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
Mo@@ st of them ag@@ re@@ ed that we were right as a matter of poli@@ cy , and , at le@@ ast in the@@ ory , as a matter of la@@ w .
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gene@@ -@@ pa@@ t@@ ent ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge were about z@@ ero .
Why is that ?
Well , the pa@@ t@@ ent of@@ fi@@ ce had been is@@ su@@ ing these pa@@ t@@ ents for more than 20 years .
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pa@@ t@@ ents on human genes .
The pa@@ t@@ ent b@@ ar was de@@ e@@ p@@ ly entr@@ en@@ ched in the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o , the bio@@ te@@ ch indu@@ stry had gro@@ wn up around this prac@@ tice , and le@@ g@@ is@@ lation to ban gene pa@@ t@@ ents had been in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed year after year in Con@@ g@@ ress , and had g@@ one absolu@@ tely no@@ where .
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be wi@@ lling to over@@ turn these pa@@ t@@ ents .
Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Ch@@ r@@ is n@@ or I were the ty@@ pe to sh@@ y away from a ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge , and hear@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; see@@ med all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght .
So we set out to build our case .
Now , pa@@ t@@ ent ca@@ ses ten@@ d to be : Co@@ mp@@ any A su@@ es Co@@ mp@@ any B over some really n@@ ar@@ row , ob@@ s@@ cur@@ e tech@@ ni@@ cal is@@ su@@ e .
We wer@@ en &apos;t really interes@@ ted in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bi@@ gg@@ er than that .
This was about scienti@@ fic f@@ ree@@ dom , medical pro@@ g@@ ress , the ri@@ ghts of patients .
So we decided we were going to develo@@ p a case that was not like your ty@@ pi@@ cal pa@@ t@@ ent case — more like a ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts case .
We set out to identi@@ f@@ y a gene@@ -@@ pa@@ t@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der that was vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously en@@ for@@ c@@ ing its pa@@ t@@ ents and then to organi@@ ze a bro@@ ad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ f@@ f@@ s and ex@@ per@@ ts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these pa@@ t@@ ents were har@@ ming patients and in@@ no@@ va@@ tion .
We found the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ da@@ te to su@@ e in M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad G@@ en@@ e@@ tics , a comp@@ any that &apos;s based in S@@ al@@ t L@@ a@@ ke C@@ ity , U@@ ta@@ h .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad hel@@ d pa@@ t@@ ents on two genes , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 genes .
W@@ o@@ men with cer@@ tain mu@@ ta@@ tions al@@ ong these genes are consider@@ ed to be at a signifi@@ can@@ tly incre@@ a@@ sed ris@@ k of develo@@ ping bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
It had for@@ ced multi@@ ple la@@ b@@ s that were of@@ fer@@ ing B@@ R@@ C@@ A t@@ esting to stop .
It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars .
It had st@@ op@@ ped shar@@ ing its c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal data with the inter@@ national scienti@@ fic commun@@ ity .
And per@@ haps wor@@ st of all , for a peri@@ od of se@@ ver@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ fu@@ sed to u@@ p@@ da@@ te its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ di@@ tional mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been identi@@ fi@@ ed by a te@@ am of resear@@ ch@@ ers in Fran@@ ce .
It has been esti@@ ma@@ ted that dur@@ ing that peri@@ od , for se@@ ver@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of wo@@ men under@@ going t@@ esting rece@@ i@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ ga@@ tive test resul@@ t that should have been posi@@ tive .
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en M@@ axi@@ an .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ s@@ ter E@@ i@@ le@@ en developed bre@@ ast cancer at age 40 and she was t@@ es@@ ted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ ga@@ tive .
The family was reli@@ e@@ ved .
That me@@ ant that E@@ i@@ le@@ en &apos;s cancer most li@@ ke@@ ly didn &apos;t r@@ un in the family , and that other me@@ mb@@ ers of her family didn &apos;t need to be t@@ es@@ ted .
But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was diagno@@ sed with ad@@ van@@ ce@@ d-@@ sta@@ ge o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
It tur@@ ned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ s@@ ter was a@@ mon@@ g the 12 percent who rece@@ i@@ ved a fal@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive test resul@@ t .
H@@ ad E@@ i@@ le@@ en rece@@ i@@ ved the pro@@ per resul@@ t , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been t@@ es@@ ted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ ven@@ ted .
One of the ma@@ j@@ or ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was figur@@ ing out how best to communi@@ cate the science .
So in order to ar@@ gue that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an in@@ ven@@ tion , and that i@@ so@@ la@@ ted B@@ R@@ C@@ A genes were produc@@ ts of n@@ ature , we had to ex@@ pla@@ in a cou@@ ple of ba@@ sic concep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
How is DNA i@@ so@@ la@@ ted , and why isn &apos;t that an in@@ ven@@ tion ?
We sp@@ ent h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s with our pla@@ in@@ ti@@ f@@ f@@ s and ex@@ per@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing these concep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely .
And we en@@ ded up re@@ l@@ ying he@@ avi@@ ly on the use of meta@@ ph@@ ors , like g@@ old .
So i@@ so@@ la@@ ting DNA — it &apos;s like extra@@ c@@ ting g@@ old from a moun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
You might be able to pa@@ t@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the g@@ old , but you can &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent the g@@ old it@@ self .
It might &apos;ve ta@@ ken a lot of hard work and ef@@ for@@ t to di@@ g the g@@ old out of the moun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent it , it &apos;s still g@@ old .
And the g@@ old , on@@ ce it &apos;s extra@@ c@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it coul@@ dn &apos;t be used for when it was in the moun@@ tain ; you can make j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pa@@ t@@ ent the g@@ old , it &apos;s still g@@ old .
So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case .
We fi@@ led in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ ist@@ ri@@ c@@ t of Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , and the case was ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly as@@ si@@ g@@ ned to J@@ ud@@ ge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et .
In Mar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , J@@ ud@@ ge S@@ we@@ et is@@ su@@ ed his op@@ ini@@ on — 1@@ 5@@ 2 pa@@ ges — and a comple@@ te vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory for our side .
In read@@ ing the op@@ ini@@ on , we could not get over how e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ently he descri@@ bed the science in the case .
I mean , our bri@@ e@@ f — it was pretty good , but not this good .
How did he develo@@ p such a de@@ ep underst@@ an@@ ding of this is@@ su@@ e in such a sh@@ or@@ t time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
So it tur@@ ned out , J@@ ud@@ ge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s c@@ ler@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ y@@ er — he was a scienti@@ st .
He was not just a scienti@@ st — he had a P@@ h@@ D in mole@@ cular bio@@ logy .
( Laughter ) What an incre@@ di@@ ble st@@ ro@@ ke of l@@ uc@@ k !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ w@@ it@@ ched si@@ des .
So in the dist@@ ri@@ c@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
But now in direc@@ t op@@ posi@@ tion to its own pa@@ t@@ ent of@@ fi@@ ce , the U@@ S government fi@@ les a bri@@ e@@ f that sta@@ tes that is has re@@ consider@@ ed this is@@ su@@ e in light of the dist@@ ri@@ c@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on , and has con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA is not pa@@ t@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble .
This was a really big de@@ al , tot@@ ally un@@ expec@@ ted .
The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it hear@@ s all pa@@ t@@ ent ca@@ ses , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pa@@ t@@ ent .
So even with this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able develo@@ p@@ ment , we expec@@ ted to lo@@ se .
And we did .
S@@ or@@ t of .
En@@ ds up sp@@ li@@ t deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 .
But the two j@@ ud@@ ges who ru@@ led aga@@ in@@ st us , did so for comple@@ tely different reas@@ ons .
The first one , J@@ ud@@ ge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bio@@ logical the@@ ory — tot@@ ally wrong .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ gue this , so it came out of the blue .
The other , J@@ ud@@ ge Mo@@ ore , said she basi@@ cally ag@@ re@@ ed with us that i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA is a produc@@ t of n@@ ature .
But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ ha@@ ke up the bio@@ te@@ ch indu@@ stry . &quot; &quot; The th@@ ird , J@@ ud@@ ge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , ag@@ re@@ ed with us .
U@@ su@@ ally these ques@@ tions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h , like a whole pa@@ ge long with l@@ ots and l@@ ots of cla@@ us@@ es , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ e@@ fore that . &quot;
We sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted per@@ haps the sh@@ or@@ test question pres@@ en@@ ted ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human genes pa@@ ten@@ table ?
Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &apos; I@@ s i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA pa@@ ten@@ table ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ op@@ e .
I want the j@@ us@@ tic@@ es to have the very same reac@@ tion that I had when you b@@ rou@@ ght this is@@ su@@ e to me se@@ ven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly coul@@ dn &apos;t ar@@ gue with that .
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only hear@@ s about one percent of the ca@@ ses that it rece@@ i@@ ves , and it ag@@ re@@ ed to he@@ ar our@@ s .
The day of the or@@ al ar@@ gu@@ ment ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really exci@@ ting — long line of people out@@ side , people had been stan@@ ding in line sin@@ ce 2 : 30 in the mor@@ ning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se .
Ch@@ r@@ is and I s@@ at qui@@ e@@ tly in the hall@@ way , mo@@ ments before he was to wal@@ k in and ar@@ gue the most important case of his car@@ e@@ er .
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
Al@@ so in the room were three lea@@ ders of the H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ o@@ me Pro@@ ject , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA hi@@ m@@ self , J@@ a@@ mes W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gene pa@@ tent@@ ing as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ ac@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversi@@ ty of the communi@@ ties repres@@ en@@ ted in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a re@@ ality s@@ po@@ ke volu@@ mes to what was at sta@@ ke .
The ar@@ gu@@ ment it@@ self was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed bri@@ lli@@ an@@ tly .
But for me , the most th@@ ri@@ lling as@@ pec@@ t was wat@@ ching the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es gra@@ p@@ ple with i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA , through a seri@@ es of col@@ or@@ ful anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ ist@@ y ex@@ chan@@ ges , very much the same way as our le@@ g@@ al te@@ am had done for the pa@@ st se@@ ven years .
J@@ us@@ tice K@@ ag@@ an li@@ k@@ en@@ ed i@@ so@@ la@@ ting DNA to extra@@ c@@ ting a medi@@ cin@@ al pl@@ ant from the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on .
J@@ us@@ tice R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts distin@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ed it from car@@ ving a base@@ b@@ all b@@ at from a t@@ ree .
And in one of my absolu@@ tely fav@@ ori@@ te mo@@ ments , J@@ us@@ tice S@@ ot@@ o@@ ma@@ y@@ or pro@@ cla@@ i@@ med i@@ so@@ la@@ ted DNA to be &quot; &quot; just n@@ ature si@@ tting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We fel@@ t pretty confi@@ d@@ ent lea@@ ving the cour@@ tro@@ o@@ m that day , but I could never have anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted the out@@ come : n@@ ine to z@@ ero .
&quot; &quot; A n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produc@@ t of n@@ ature , and not pa@@ tent@@ -@@ eli@@ gi@@ ble mer@@ e@@ ly because it has been i@@ so@@ la@@ ted .
And f@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s of the deci@@ sion , five la@@ b@@ s had an@@ no@@ un@@ ced that they would beg@@ in to of@@ fer t@@ esting for the B@@ R@@ C@@ A genes .
So@@ me of them pro@@ mi@@ sed to of@@ fer the t@@ est@@ s at a lo@@ wer pri@@ ce than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
So@@ me pro@@ mi@@ sed to pro@@ vi@@ de a more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive test than the one M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad was of@@ fer@@ ing .
But of course the deci@@ sion goes far be@@ y@@ on@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year prac@@ tice of al@@ lo@@ wing pa@@ t@@ ents on human genes in the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
It c@@ lear@@ s a signifi@@ can@@ t bar@@ ri@@ er to bio@@ medical disco@@ very and in@@ no@@ va@@ tion .
And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that patients like A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en and E@@ i@@ le@@ en have ac@@ cess to the t@@ est@@ s that they need .
A few wee@@ ks after the cour@@ t is@@ su@@ ed its deci@@ sion , I rece@@ i@@ ved a small p@@ ac@@ k@@ age in the mai@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big ris@@ k in taking this case .
Par@@ t of what ga@@ ve us the cou@@ ra@@ ge to take that ris@@ k was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
The process took ne@@ ar@@ ly ei@@ ght years from the start to fin@@ is@@ h , with many tw@@ ist@@ s and tur@@ ns al@@ ong the way .
A little l@@ uc@@ k cer@@ tain@@ ly hel@@ ped , but it was the communi@@ ties that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ an@@ ces that we cre@@ ated , that made pi@@ gs f@@ ly .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . To@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through gli@@ mp@@ ses of about ei@@ ght of my pro@@ jects , done in col@@ labor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ is@@ h arti@@ st So@@ ren P@@ ors .
We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ ao , and we live and work in In@@ dia .
I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was in@@ spi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar hab@@ it of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to br@@ ing him a g@@ la@@ ss of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes .
And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a res@@ pec@@ ted figur@@ e in the In@@ di@@ an family .
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a lan@@ d@@ line tele@@ ph@@ one .
He would h@@ old on to the rece@@ i@@ ver and expec@@ t me to di@@ al a number for him .
And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle us@@ es a ph@@ one that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his com@@ man@@ ds .
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter through which he could dis@@ pen@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ eces around the world as an e@@ mai@@ l .
So what he had to do was take a piece of pa@@ per , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his e@@ mai@@ l or com@@ m@@ and and pul@@ l the pa@@ per out .
This devi@@ ce would auto@@ ma@@ tically sen@@ d the inten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an e@@ mai@@ l .
So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic@@ s that underst@@ an@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to di@@ gi@@ tal .
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal inter@@ face .
And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of ri@@ tu@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it .
The next work is a so@@ un@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive inst@@ al@@ lation that we af@@ fec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ atur@@ es .
So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and be@@ hind them , we have these little cre@@ atur@@ es which hi@@ de .
And as so@@ on as it &apos;s si@@ l@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out .
And if it &apos;s even more si@@ l@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out .
And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again .
So we had these pan@@ els on three wal@@ ls of a room .
And we had over 5@@ 00 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding be@@ hind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from be@@ hind the pan@@ els .
And they he@@ ar like human@@ s do , or real cre@@ atur@@ es do .
So they get im@@ mun@@ e to so@@ unds that s@@ care them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t reac@@ t to bac@@ k@@ ground so@@ unds .
You &apos;ll he@@ ar a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t reac@@ t to .
( No@@ i@@ se ) But they reac@@ t to fo@@ re@@ ground so@@ unds . You &apos;ll he@@ ar that in a second .
( W@@ hist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ che , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , person@@ ali@@ ties and so on .
So this is a very early pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
O@@ f course , it got much better after that .
And we made them reac@@ t to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them .
This is a video inst@@ al@@ lation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the no@@ tion of in@@ visi@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bility ?
So we worked with a comp@@ any that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to develo@@ p a piece of sof@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tra@@ ck them and re@@ place one person with the bac@@ k@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them invi@@ sible .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
O@@ n the right side you can see my col@@ lea@@ gue So@@ ren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ ces@@ sed video where the cam@@ era has made him invi@@ sible .
So@@ ren en@@ ters the room . Po@@ p ! He goes invi@@ sible .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is tra@@ c@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later .
So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all .
And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cep@@ t with one differ@@ ence : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly invi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ un S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a s@@ he@@ et of pa@@ per , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a s@@ un .
And from the front , this ob@@ ject ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed to be very st@@ rong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost see@@ med very we@@ ak .
So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ nor@@ e it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around .
But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to cli@@ m@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fas@@ hi@@ on .
And it would get ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , and it would col@@ la@@ p@@ se every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ i@@ ca@@ ture of an u@@ p@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fal@@ l@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a pl@@ ant .
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low mo@@ ve@@ ment .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ in@@ ed by that cir@@ cle .
Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space .
And there &apos;s no w@@ ir@@ es .
So I &apos;ll just show you an inst@@ ance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it activ@@ ates this ob@@ ject .
And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few minu@@ tes , sort of pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ ly goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m and it loo@@ ks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l it@@ self up .
So this work was a real tech@@ ni@@ cal ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s right and the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs .
And it was very important for us to esta@@ bli@@ sh the exac@@ t moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would to@@ p@@ ple over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge it@@ self , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test s@@ cen@@ ario — it &apos;s much fas@@ ter .
That &apos;s my col@@ lea@@ gue . He &apos;s let it go .
Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go ca@@ t@@ ch it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft it@@ self up on its own .
So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the ni@@ ght sk@@ y .
And it &apos;s at the s@@ cal@@ e of the ni@@ ght sk@@ y .
So we w@@ rap@@ ped this around a blo@@ b@@ -@@ like form , which is in the s@@ hap@@ e of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was han@@ ging from the ce@@ il@@ ing .
And the idea was to sort of contra@@ st something very co@@ ld and dist@@ ant and ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t like the universe into the famili@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ ti@@ mate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling ni@@ ght sk@@ y .
So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ g@@ ress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big stan@@ ding in front of you in the mi@@ d@@ dle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tri@@ ed to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ te you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; ei@@ ght &#93; times its volu@@ me .
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ stan@@ tly ex@@ pan@@ ding and contra@@ c@@ ting to create a dy@@ na@@ mic with people mo@@ ving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ a@@ ms or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interes@@ ted in the way that it can help us to expres@@ s the emo@@ tions and behavi@@ or@@ al pa@@ tter@@ ns in these cre@@ atur@@ es that we create .
And on@@ ce a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to exis@@ t and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minu@@ tes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audi@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves s@@ mal@@ ler ?
Ma@@ ybe you &apos;re hun@@ ching , cro@@ s@@ sing your le@@ gs , maybe w@@ rap@@ ping your an@@ k@@ les .
So@@ me@@ times we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
So@@ me@@ times we s@@ pre@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pa@@ y attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minu@@ tes , and I &apos;m ho@@ ping that if you learn to tw@@ e@@ ak this a little bit , it could signifi@@ can@@ tly change the way your life un@@ fol@@ ds .
So , we &apos;re really fas@@ cin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly interes@@ ted in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interes@@ ted in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward interac@@ tion , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ s@@ ha@@ ke .
N@@ arra@@ tor : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ u@@ mber 10 .
This l@@ uc@@ k@@ y poli@@ ce@@ man gets to s@@ ha@@ ke han@@ ds with the P@@ res@@ id@@ ent of the Uni@@ ted Sta@@ tes .
Here comes the Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A@@ my C@@ ud@@ dy : So a han@@ d@@ s@@ ha@@ ke , or the lack of a han@@ d@@ s@@ ha@@ ke , can have us talking for wee@@ ks and wee@@ ks and wee@@ ks .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
So obvi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about communi@@ cation .
When we think about communi@@ cation , we think about interac@@ tions .
So what is your body language communi@@ ca@@ ting to me ?
What &apos;s min@@ e communi@@ ca@@ ting to you ?
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a v@@ ali@@ d way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
And those j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ dic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ m@@ ote , who we ask out on a da@@ te .
For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ mb@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versi@@ ty , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second so@@ und@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent interac@@ tions , their j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess pre@@ dic@@ t whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed .
So it doesn &apos;t have to do so much with whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an was in@@ com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent , but do we like that person and how they interac@@ ted ?
E@@ ven more dra@@ ma@@ tic , A@@ le@@ x To@@ d@@ or@@ o@@ v at P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ ton has sho@@ wn us that j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments of poli@@ tical can@@ di@@ da@@ tes &apos; fac@@ es in just one second pre@@ dic@@ t 70 percent of U.@@ S@@ . S@@ en@@ ate and gu@@ ber@@ n@@ atori@@ al race out@@ comes , and even , let &apos;s go di@@ gi@@ tal , emo@@ ti@@ con@@ s used well in on@@ line ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations can le@@ ad you to cla@@ i@@ m more valu@@ e from that ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation .
If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?
So when we think of n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s , we think of how we j@@ ud@@ ge others , how they j@@ ud@@ ge us and what the out@@ comes are .
We ten@@ d to for@@ get , though , the other audi@@ ence that &apos;s inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s , and that &apos;s ourselves .
We are also inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s , our thou@@ ghts and our fe@@ el@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy .
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ cho@@ lo@@ g@@ ist . I study pre@@ j@@ u@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ peti@@ tive bus@@ in@@ ess school , so it was in@@ evi@@ table that I would become interes@@ ted in power dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs .
I became especi@@ ally interes@@ ted in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al expres@@ si@@ ons of power and do@@ min@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al expres@@ si@@ ons of power and do@@ min@@ ance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding .
So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basi@@ cally op@@ en@@ ing up .
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
And this is true across the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
It &apos;s not just limi@@ ted to pri@@ ma@@ tes .
And human@@ s do the same thing . ( Laughter ) So they do this both when they have power sort of ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally , and also when they &apos;re fe@@ el@@ ing power@@ ful in the moment .
And this one is especi@@ ally interesting because it really sho@@ ws us how univer@@ sa@@ l and old these expres@@ si@@ ons of power are .
This expres@@ sion , which is kno@@ wn as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ sica T@@ rac@@ y has stu@@ died .
She sho@@ ws that people who are bor@@ n with si@@ ght and people who are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally b@@ lin@@ d do this when they w@@ in at a physical com@@ peti@@ tion .
So when they cro@@ ss the fin@@ is@@ h line and they &apos;ve w@@ on , it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;ve never seen any@@ one do it .
They do this .
So the ar@@ ms up in the V , the ch@@ in is sli@@ gh@@ tly li@@ f@@ ted .
What do we do when we feel power@@ less ?
We do exactly the op@@ posi@@ te .
We clo@@ se up . We w@@ ra@@ p ourselves up .
We make ourselves small .
We don &apos;t want to bu@@ m@@ p into the person next to us .
So again , both animals and human@@ s do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So what we ten@@ d to do when it comes to power is that we comple@@ ment the other &apos;s n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s .
So if someone is being really power@@ ful with us , we ten@@ d to make ourselves s@@ mal@@ ler . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them .
We do the op@@ posi@@ te of them .
So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?
I no@@ tice that M@@ B@@ A stud@@ ents really ex@@ hi@@ bit the full ran@@ ge of power n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s .
So you have people who are like car@@ i@@ ca@@ tures of al@@ p@@ has , really coming into the room , they get right into the mi@@ d@@ dle of the room before cla@@ ss even star@@ ts , like they really want to oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y space .
When they si@@ t down , they &apos;re sort of s@@ pre@@ ad out .
They rai@@ se their han@@ ds like this .
You see it on their fac@@ es and their bo@@ dies , and they si@@ t in their cha@@ ir and they make themselves tin@@ y , and they go like this when they rai@@ se their hand .
I no@@ tice a cou@@ ple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be sur@@ pri@@ sed .
It see@@ ms to be rela@@ ted to gen@@ der .
So wo@@ men are much more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
W@@ o@@ men feel ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally less power@@ ful than men , so this is not sur@@ pri@@ sing .
But the other thing I no@@ tic@@ ed is that it also see@@ med to be rela@@ ted to the ex@@ t@@ ent to which the stud@@ ents were partici@@ pa@@ ting , and how well they were partici@@ pa@@ ting .
And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , because partici@@ pa@@ tion coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de .
So bus@@ in@@ ess s@@ cho@@ ols have been stru@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
You get these equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed wo@@ men and men coming in and then you get these differ@@ ences in gra@@ des , and it see@@ ms to be par@@ tly at@@ tri@@ bu@@ table to partici@@ pa@@ tion .
So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re partici@@ pa@@ ting .
I@@ s it possible that we could get people to fa@@ ke it and would it le@@ ad them to partici@@ pa@@ te more ?
So my ma@@ in col@@ labor@@ at@@ or D@@ ana Car@@ ne@@ y , who &apos;s at B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y , and I really wanted to know , can you fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ?
Li@@ ke , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavi@@ or@@ al out@@ come that makes you see@@ m more power@@ ful ?
So we know that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s go@@ ver@@ n how other people think and feel about us . There &apos;s a lot of evi@@ den@@ ce .
But our question really was , do our n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves ?
There &apos;s some evi@@ den@@ ce that they do .
So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happ@@ y , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mi@@ le by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happ@@ y .
So it goes both ways .
When it comes to power , it also goes both ways .
So when you feel power@@ ful , you &apos;re more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when you pre@@ ten@@ d to be power@@ ful , you are more li@@ ke@@ ly to actually feel power@@ ful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?
And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the power@@ ful , what am I talking about ?
So I &apos;m talking about thou@@ ghts and fe@@ el@@ ings and the sort of physi@@ o@@ logical things that make up our thou@@ ghts and fe@@ el@@ ings , and in my case , that &apos;s hormon@@ es . I look at hormon@@ es .
So what do the min@@ ds of the power@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
So power@@ ful people ten@@ d to be , not sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more confi@@ d@@ ent , more op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic .
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at games of chan@@ ce .
They also ten@@ d to be able to think more ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tly .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
There are a lot of differ@@ ences between power@@ ful and power@@ less people .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally , there also are differ@@ ences on two k@@ ey hormon@@ es : t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one , which is the do@@ min@@ ance hor@@ m@@ one , and cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , which is the st@@ ress hor@@ m@@ one .
So what does that mean ? When you think about power , people ten@@ ded to think only about t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one , because that was about do@@ min@@ ance .
But really , power is also about how you reac@@ t to st@@ ress .
So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ad@@ er that &apos;s do@@ min@@ ant , high on t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one , but really st@@ ress reac@@ tive ?
Pro@@ bab@@ ly not , right ?
You want the person who &apos;s power@@ ful and as@@ ser@@ tive and do@@ min@@ ant , but not very st@@ ress reac@@ tive , the person who &apos;s la@@ id back .
So we know that in pri@@ mate hi@@ er@@ ar@@ chi@@ es , if an al@@ p@@ ha nee@@ ds to take over , if an individu@@ al nee@@ ds to take over an al@@ p@@ ha ro@@ le sort of su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , within a few days , that individu@@ al &apos;s t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one has g@@ one up signifi@@ can@@ tly and his cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l has dro@@ p@@ ped signifi@@ can@@ tly .
So we have this evi@@ den@@ ce , both that the body can s@@ hap@@ e the mind , at le@@ ast at the fa@@ cial level , and also that ro@@ le chan@@ ges can s@@ hap@@ e the mind .
So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tin@@ y man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?
&quot; &quot; For two minu@@ tes , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; I want you to st@@ and like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more power@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So this is what we did .
We decided to br@@ ing people into the lab and r@@ un a little experi@@ ment , and these people ado@@ p@@ ted , for two minu@@ tes , ei@@ ther high@@ -@@ power pos@@ es or low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es , and I &apos;m just going to show you five of the pos@@ es , al@@ though they took on only two .
So here &apos;s one .
A cou@@ ple more .
This one has been du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ der W@@ o@@ man &quot; &quot; by the media .
Here are a cou@@ ple more .
So you can be stan@@ ding or you can be si@@ tting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low@@ -@@ power .
When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really protec@@ ting yourself .
So this is what happens .
They come in , they sp@@ it into a vi@@ al , for two minu@@ tes , we say , &quot; &quot; You need to do this or this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t look at pic@@ tures of the pos@@ es .
We don &apos;t want to pri@@ me them with a concep@@ t of power .
We want them to be fe@@ el@@ ing power .
So two minu@@ tes they do this .
We then ask them , &quot; &quot; How power@@ ful do you feel ? &quot; &quot; on a seri@@ es of i@@ te@@ ms , and then we give them an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to ga@@ m@@ ble , and then we take another s@@ ali@@ va sa@@ mp@@ le .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experi@@ ment .
So this is what we find .
Ris@@ k to@@ ler@@ ance , which is the ga@@ mb@@ ling , we find that when you are in the high@@ -@@ power pos@@ e condi@@ tion , 8@@ 6 percent of you will ga@@ m@@ ble .
When you &apos;re in the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ e condi@@ tion , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a wh@@ op@@ ping signifi@@ can@@ t differ@@ ence .
Here &apos;s what we find on t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one .
F@@ ro@@ m their base@@ line when they come in , high@@ -@@ power people experience about a 20@@ -@@ percent incre@@ ase , and low@@ -@@ power people experience about a 10@@ -@@ percent de@@ cre@@ ase .
So again , two minu@@ tes , and you get these chan@@ ges .
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ -@@ power people experience about a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ percent de@@ cre@@ ase , and the low@@ -@@ power people experience about a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ percent incre@@ ase .
So two minu@@ tes le@@ ad to these hormon@@ al chan@@ ges that con@@ figur@@ e your brain to basi@@ cally be ei@@ ther as@@ ser@@ tive , confi@@ d@@ ent and com@@ for@@ table , or really st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ reac@@ tive , and fe@@ el@@ ing sort of sh@@ ut down .
And we &apos;ve all had the fe@@ el@@ ing , right ?
So it see@@ ms that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Al@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds .
But the next question , of course , is , can power pos@@ ing for a few minu@@ tes really change your life in me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ways ?
This is in the lab , it &apos;s this little tas@@ k , it &apos;s just a cou@@ ple of minu@@ tes .
Wh@@ ere can you actually ap@@ p@@ ly this ?
Wh@@ ich we car@@ ed about , of course .
And so we think where you want to use this is e@@ valu@@ a@@ tive situ@@ ations , like social th@@ re@@ at situ@@ ations .
Wh@@ ere are you being e@@ valu@@ ated , ei@@ ther by your fri@@ ends ?
For te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers , it &apos;s at the l@@ un@@ ch@@ room table .
For some people it &apos;s spe@@ a@@ king at a school bo@@ ard me@@ e@@ ting .
It might be gi@@ ving a p@@ it@@ ch or gi@@ ving a talk like this or doing a job inter@@ vie@@ w .
We decided that the one that most people could rela@@ te to because most people had been through , was the job inter@@ vie@@ w .
So we publi@@ sh@@ ed these fin@@ d@@ ings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job inter@@ vie@@ w , right ?
( Laughter ) You know , so we were of course hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed , and said , Oh my God , no , that &apos;s not what we me@@ ant at all .
For nu@@ mer@@ ous reas@@ ons , no , don &apos;t do that .
A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
What do you do before you go into a job inter@@ vie@@ w ? You do this .
You &apos;re si@@ tting down . You &apos;re looking at your i@@ P@@ h@@ one — or your An@@ dro@@ id , not trying to lea@@ ve any@@ one out .
You &apos;re looking at your n@@ ot@@ es , you &apos;re hun@@ ching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the ba@@ th@@ room , right ? D@@ o that . F@@ ind two minu@@ tes .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
So we br@@ ing people into a lab , and they do ei@@ ther high@@ - or low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es again , they go through a very st@@ res@@ s@@ ful job inter@@ vie@@ w .
It &apos;s five minu@@ tes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
They &apos;re being j@@ ud@@ ged also , and the j@@ ud@@ ges are tra@@ in@@ ed to give no n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al fe@@ e@@ d@@ back , so they look like this .
Ima@@ g@@ ine this is the person inter@@ vie@@ wing you .
So for five minu@@ tes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led .
People ha@@ te this .
It &apos;s what M@@ ari@@ an@@ ne L@@ a@@ Fran@@ ce cal@@ ls &quot; &quot; stan@@ ding in social qu@@ ick@@ s@@ and . &quot; &quot; So this really spi@@ kes your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
So this is the job inter@@ vie@@ w we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these co@@ ders look at these ta@@ pes , four of them .
They &apos;re b@@ lin@@ d to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis . They &apos;re b@@ lin@@ d to the condi@@ tions .
They have no idea who &apos;s been pos@@ ing in what pos@@ e , and they end up looking at these se@@ ts of ta@@ pes , and they say , &quot; &quot; We want to hi@@ re these people , &quot; &quot; all the high@@ -@@ power pos@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to hi@@ re these people .
We also e@@ valu@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively over@@ all . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s dri@@ ving it ?
It &apos;s not about the cont@@ ent of the spe@@ ec@@ h .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
Because we rate them on all these vari@@ ab@@ les rela@@ ted to com@@ pe@@ ten@@ ce , like , how w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ struc@@ tu@@ red is the spe@@ ec@@ h ?
How good is it ? What are their qu@@ ali@@ fica@@ tions ?
No effec@@ t on those things . This is what &apos;s af@@ fec@@ ted .
These kinds of things .
People are br@@ ing@@ ing their true selves , basi@@ cally .
They &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing themselves .
They br@@ ing their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , res@@ i@@ du@@ e over them .
So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effec@@ t , or medi@@ ating the effec@@ t .
So when I tell people about this , that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds and our min@@ ds can change our behavi@@ or , and our behavi@@ or can change our out@@ comes , they say to me , &quot; &quot; It fe@@ els fa@@ ke . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?
So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it .
It &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like I &apos;m not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here .
And that really res@@ on@@ ated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an im@@ pos@@ tor and fe@@ el@@ ing like I &apos;m not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here .
When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times .
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
And I wo@@ ke up in a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y re@@ ha@@ b ward , and I had been with@@ dra@@ wn from colle@@ ge , and I learned that my I@@ Q had dro@@ p@@ ped by two stan@@ d@@ ard devi@@ ations , which was very tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fi@@ ed with being s@@ mar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child .
So I &apos;m ta@@ ken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ is@@ h colle@@ ge .
J@@ ust , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that &apos;s not going to work out for you . &quot; &quot; So I really stru@@ gg@@ led with this , and I have to say , having your identi@@ ty ta@@ ken from you , your co@@ re identi@@ ty , and for me it was being s@@ mar@@ t , having that ta@@ ken from you , there &apos;s nothing that lea@@ ves you fe@@ el@@ ing more power@@ less than that .
So I fel@@ t enti@@ re@@ ly power@@ less .
I worked and worked , and I got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , and worked , and got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , and worked .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge .
It took me four years lon@@ ger than my pe@@ ers , and I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed someone , my an@@ ge@@ l ad@@ vis@@ or , Su@@ san F@@ is@@ ke , to take me on , and so I en@@ ded up at P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ ton , and I was like , I am not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here .
That &apos;s it .
I was so af@@ ra@@ id of being found out the next day that I called her and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m qu@@ it@@ ting . &quot; &quot; She was like , &quot; &quot; You are not qu@@ it@@ ting , because I took a ga@@ m@@ ble on you , and you &apos;re sta@@ ying .
You &apos;re going to sta@@ y , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terri@@ fi@@ ed and just par@@ al@@ y@@ zed and having an out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my go@@ sh , I &apos;m doing it .
Li@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
F@@ i@@ ve years in gra@@ d school , a few years , you know , I &apos;m at Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n , I mo@@ ved to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , I &apos;m at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , I &apos;m not really thinking about it any@@ more , but for a long time I had been thinking , &quot; No@@ t sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here . &quot;
So at the end of my first year at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , a stud@@ ent who had not tal@@ ked in cla@@ ss the entire se@@ mes@@ ter , who I had said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , you &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ta partici@@ pa@@ te or else you &apos;re going to fa@@ il , &quot; &quot; came into my of@@ fi@@ ce . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
She came in tot@@ ally de@@ fe@@ ated , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m not sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here . &quot;
And that was the moment for me .
Because two things happened .
One was that I realiz@@ ed , oh my go@@ sh , I don &apos;t feel like that any@@ more .
I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that fe@@ el@@ ing .
And the second was , she is sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here !
Li@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it .
So I was like , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you are ! You are sup@@ pos@@ ed to be here !
And to@@ mor@@ row you &apos;re going to fa@@ ke it , you &apos;re going to make yourself power@@ ful , and , you know — ( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go into the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , and you are going to give the best com@@ ment ever . &quot; &quot; You know ? And she ga@@ ve the best com@@ ment ever , and people tur@@ ned around and were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even no@@ tice her si@@ tting there . ( Laughter ) She comes back to me months later , and I realiz@@ ed that she had not just fa@@ ked it ti@@ ll she made it , she had actually fa@@ ked it ti@@ ll she became it .
So she had chan@@ ged .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it .
F@@ a@@ ke it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to lea@@ ve you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ a@@ ks can le@@ ad to big chan@@ ges .
So , this is two minu@@ tes .
Be@@ fore you go into the next st@@ res@@ s@@ ful e@@ valu@@ a@@ tive situ@@ ation , for two minu@@ tes , try doing this , in the e@@ lev@@ at@@ or , in a ba@@ th@@ room st@@ all , at your des@@ k be@@ hind clo@@ sed do@@ ors .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Con@@ figur@@ e your brain to co@@ pe the best in that situ@@ ation .
G@@ et your t@@ est@@ o@@ ster@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
D@@ on &apos;t lea@@ ve that situ@@ ation fe@@ el@@ ing like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Le@@ a@@ ve that situ@@ ation fe@@ el@@ ing like , I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am .
So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power pos@@ ing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
I don &apos;t have e@@ go invol@@ ved in this . ( Laughter ) Gi@@ ve it away . S@@ h@@ are it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no res@@ our@@ ces and no technology and no sta@@ tu@@ s and no power .
Gi@@ ve it to them because they can do it in priva@@ te .
They need their bo@@ dies , pri@@ vac@@ y and two minu@@ tes , and it can signifi@@ can@@ tly change the out@@ comes of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ gg@@ est problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ vi@@ ron@@ men@@ tal@@ ist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and pa@@ per because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
So get out your p@@ en and pa@@ per .
B@@ ot@@ to@@ m line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without c@@ le@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without s@@ ani@@ tation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people d@@ ying of H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bi@@ llions of people who will be se@@ ver@@ e@@ ly af@@ fec@@ ted by climate change — so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the econo@@ my s@@ es@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to s@@ pen@@ d to do good in this world , where should we s@@ pen@@ d it ?
We identi@@ fi@@ ed 10 of the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : climate change , communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , con@@ fli@@ c@@ ts , education , finan@@ cial in@@ sta@@ bility , govern@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and hun@@ ger , population mi@@ gra@@ tion , s@@ ani@@ tation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers .
We believe that these in many ways en@@ compas@@ s the bi@@ gg@@ est problems in the world .
The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bi@@ gg@@ est things ?
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ a@@ vos in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to fo@@ c@@ us on problems .
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
Su@@ re@@ ly the bi@@ gg@@ est problem we have in the world is that we all di@@ e .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?
So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems .
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ lica@@ ted .
To climate change that would be like K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
To communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , it might be health c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s or mos@@ qu@@ ito ne@@ ts .
To con@@ fli@@ c@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ e@@ ping for@@ ces , and so on .
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible tas@@ k — wri@@ te down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ ori@@ ties .
And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econo@@ mi@@ cs gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
What should be at the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st ?
P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , per@@ haps talk to your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or , and just figur@@ e out what should be the top pri@@ ori@@ ties and the bot@@ to@@ m pri@@ ori@@ ties of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ gg@@ est is@@ su@@ es .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 1@@ 8 minu@@ tes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these dis@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?
O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation is incre@@ di@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to do this .
O@@ f course , every organi@@ z@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st .
But every organi@@ z@@ ation would also ha@@ te to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
And sin@@ ce there are many more n@@ ot@@ -@@ nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ one s@@ po@@ ts on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes perfec@@ t sense not to want to do such a li@@ st .
We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a funda@@ mental li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing , if only imp@@ li@@ ci@@ tly — and that &apos;s un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it .
So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ic@@ es .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , n@@ or the si@@ z@@ es .
We have not had an idea .
Ima@@ g@@ ine going into a res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u car@@ d , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is .
You know , you have a pi@@ z@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is .
It could be at one dol@@ lar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars .
It could be a fami@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ za , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these is@@ su@@ es .
And so basi@@ cally , this has been the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econo@@ mi@@ sts , three in each are@@ a .
So we have three of world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts wri@@ te about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the co@@ st and what will be the ben@@ ef@@ it of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases .
Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top ex@@ per@@ ts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts , ei@@ ght of the world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts , inclu@@ ding three No@@ bel Lau@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am te@@ am . &quot; &quot; The C@@ a@@ mb@@ ri@@ dge Uni@@ versi@@ ty pre@@ fec@@ ts decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econo@@ mi@@ cs .
That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basi@@ cally did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed li@@ st .
And then you ask , why econo@@ mi@@ sts ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happ@@ y you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about mal@@ aria , you ask a mal@@ aria ex@@ per@@ t .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ ma@@ to@@ lo@@ g@@ ist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should de@@ al with first , you can &apos;t ask ei@@ ther of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That is what econo@@ mi@@ sts do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing tas@@ k of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds ?
So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ si@@ te , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
They basi@@ cally came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basi@@ cally , pro@@ jects where if you inv@@ est a dol@@ lar , you get less than a dol@@ lar back .
Then there &apos;s fa@@ ir pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to go from bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
As you might see the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st was climate change .
This of@@ fen@@ ds a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t come back , ei@@ ther .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curi@@ ous .
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disa@@ gre@@ e with on the li@@ st that you w@@ r@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ o@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ o@@ to — is a bad de@@ al is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happen@@ ing .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high co@@ st .
What they basi@@ cally show us , the a@@ ver@@ age of all mac@@ ro@@ econo@@ mic mode@@ ls , is that K@@ y@@ o@@ to , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would co@@ st about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develo@@ p@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird W@@ or@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mode@@ ls show it will pos@@ t@@ pon@@ e war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h who gets a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good .
So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually esti@@ mate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all ma@@ j@@ or ba@@ sic problems in the world .
We could give c@@ le@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , s@@ ani@@ tation , ba@@ sic health@@ care and education to every single human being on the plan@@ et .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to s@@ pen@@ d tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity .
The fa@@ ir pro@@ jects — no@@ tice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , s@@ cal@@ e of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vi@@ ces — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , s@@ cal@@ e of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vi@@ ces is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very co@@ st@@ ly .
A@@ ga@@ in , what it te@@ lls us is su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation .
If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of s@@ ani@@ tation and water pro@@ jects came in .
A@@ ga@@ in , s@@ ani@@ tation and water is incre@@ di@@ bly important , but it also co@@ sts a lot of inf@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ ori@@ ties which should be at le@@ ast the first ones that we de@@ al with when we talk about how we should de@@ al with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is mal@@ aria — de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ aria .
The inci@@ den@@ ce of mal@@ aria is about a cou@@ ple of &#91; million &#93; people get infec@@ ted every year .
It might even co@@ st up to@@ war@@ ds a per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for af@@ fec@@ ted na@@ tions .
If we inv@@ es@@ ted about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could br@@ ing that inci@@ den@@ ce down to half .
We could a@@ vo@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 people d@@ ying , but per@@ haps more import@@ an@@ tly , we could a@@ vo@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infec@@ ted every year .
We would signifi@@ can@@ tly incre@@ ase their ability to de@@ al with many of the other problems that they have to de@@ al with — of course , in the long r@@ un , also to de@@ al with global war@@ ming .
This th@@ ird best one was f@@ ree tra@@ de .
B@@ asi@@ cally , the mode@@ l sho@@ w@@ ed that if we could get f@@ ree tra@@ de , and especi@@ ally c@@ ut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.@@ S@@ . and Europe , we could basi@@ cally en@@ li@@ ven the global econo@@ my to an a@@ sto@@ un@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would ac@@ cru@@ e to the Th@@ ird W@@ or@@ ld .
A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hundre@@ d million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very ra@@ dic@@ ally f@@ ast , in about two to five years .
That would be the th@@ ird best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to fo@@ c@@ us on mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion .
No@@ t just mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ a@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the lack of mi@@ c@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents .
B@@ asi@@ cally , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ o@@ d@@ ine and vi@@ ta@@ min A@@ .
If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ ver@@ e in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem .
That would be the second best inv@@ est@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to fo@@ c@@ us on H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
B@@ asi@@ cally , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next ei@@ ght years , we could a@@ vo@@ id 2@@ 8 new million ca@@ ses of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on is saying there are two very different ways that we can de@@ al with H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do ei@@ ther , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at le@@ ast ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first .
And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion .
So basi@@ cally , what this fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on is saying , we can do a lot more by inv@@ esting in pre@@ ven@@ tion .
B@@ asi@@ cally for the amount of money that we s@@ pen@@ d , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion .
So again , what we fo@@ c@@ us on is pre@@ ven@@ tion ra@@ ther than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first rate .
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?
O@@ r did you get clo@@ se to what we came up with here ?
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly that we should do that .
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually fo@@ c@@ us on problems , that we fo@@ c@@ us on the right ones .
The ones where we can do a lot of good ra@@ ther than a little good .
And I think , actually — Th@@ o@@ mas S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling , one of the partici@@ pan@@ ts in the dre@@ am te@@ am , he put it very , very well .
One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er .
E@@ ven the most pes@@ simi@@ stic impac@@ t s@@ cen@@ arios of the U.@@ N@@ .
esti@@ mate that the a@@ ver@@ age person in the develo@@ ping world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
M@@ uch more li@@ ke@@ ly , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that .
But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h@@ i .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ u@@ t@@ ch guy .
And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to s@@ pen@@ d a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ u@@ t@@ ch guy ?
O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h , who really need the help , and who@@ m we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?
O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Ch@@ in@@ ese , a ri@@ ch B@@ oli@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How o@@ d@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther and my great gran@@ d@@ fa@@ ther , who@@ m they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who nee@@ ded the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ ori@@ ties stra@@ ight .
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because climate change has good pic@@ tures .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay Af@@ ter To@@ mor@@ row &quot; &quot; — it loo@@ ks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good fil@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expec@@ t E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to ca@@ st B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next mo@@ vi@@ e di@@ gg@@ ing la@@ tr@@ in@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a mo@@ vi@@ e .
So in many ways , I think of the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ ori@@ ties as a defen@@ se for bor@@ ing problems .
To make sure that we realiz@@ e it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
The other ob@@ jec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ it@@ ing a fal@@ se cho@@ ice .
O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to s@@ pen@@ d tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develo@@ ping world .
S@@ in@@ ce then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pa@@ th of su@@ d@@ den@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q w@@ ar ?
You know , we s@@ pen@@ d 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we s@@ pen@@ d that on doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m all for that .
If any one of you gu@@ ys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s fin@@ e .
But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to s@@ pen@@ d that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
So the real is@@ su@@ e here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ ori@@ ties .
I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econo@@ mi@@ sts , you in@@ evi@@ ta@@ bly end up as@@ king old , whi@@ te Ameri@@ can men .
And they &apos;re not neces@@ s@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
So we actually invi@@ ted 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
The only two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments were that they were stud@@ ying at the uni@@ versi@@ ty , and they s@@ po@@ ke English .
The ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develo@@ ping countries .
They had all the same material but they could go va@@ st@@ ly out@@ side the s@@ co@@ pe of dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts .
And the sur@@ pri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very similar — with mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and dise@@ ases at the top and climate change at the bot@@ to@@ m .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ar@@ s and uni@@ versi@@ ty stud@@ ents , and different things .
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pa@@ th a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ ori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 .
Ma@@ p out the right pa@@ th for the world — but also to start thinking about poli@@ tical tri@@ age .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high co@@ st , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enor@@ mous amount of good , at very low co@@ st , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can disa@@ gre@@ e with the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ ran@@ k about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things .
So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ ori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house .
And as I sto@@ od on the front por@@ ch fu@@ mb@@ ling in my po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys .
In fact , I could see them through the win@@ do@@ w , l@@ ying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them .
I coul@@ dn &apos;t go back to my fri@@ end J@@ ef@@ f &apos;s house for the ni@@ ght because I had an early f@@ light to Europe the next mor@@ ning , and I nee@@ ded to get my pas@@ s@@ port and my su@@ it@@ case .
So@@ me of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous .
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
A@@ ro@@ und the home , desig@@ na@@ te a place for things that are e@@ asi@@ ly lost .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that al@@ lo@@ ws s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
For your pas@@ s@@ port , a particular dra@@ wer .
If you desig@@ na@@ te a s@@ po@@ t and you &apos;re s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about tra@@ vel ?
Now these are some ra@@ ther obvi@@ ous things .
Re@@ member , when you &apos;re under st@@ ress , the brain re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ xi@@ c , and it caus@@ es cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking .
And so I want to talk about that .
So sup@@ pos@@ e you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
It &apos;s for the number nee@@ ded to tre@@ at .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ z@@ y sta@@ ti@@ stic is that ?
The number should be one .
But actually , medical prac@@ tice doesn &apos;t work that way .
We ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ xo@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line esti@@ ma@@ tes that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number nee@@ ded to tre@@ at for the most w@@ ide@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed sta@@ ti@@ n , what do you sup@@ pos@@ e it is ?
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ ped ?
I ran through the nu@@ mb@@ ers myself .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the sta@@ ti@@ n or not .
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversa@@ tion with your doc@@ tor .
That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ ped .
And the side effec@@ ts in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the s@@ po@@ t .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
There &apos;s an evolu@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ zing that all of us are f@@ la@@ w@@ ed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fa@@ il@@ ur@@ es might be , to put syste@@ ms in place that will help min@@ imi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happen@@ ing in the first place .
G@@ o@@ od mor@@ ning !
A@@ re you a@@ wa@@ ke ?
An@@ y@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem .
He looked at me st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d .
&quot; &quot; Co@@ me , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ i@@ ter .
How could she spe@@ ak that way ?
A@@ t that moment , I started thinking .
It defini@@ tely h@@ ur@@ ts !
How did we get here ?
Des@@ pi@@ te all that , I tri@@ ed to understand him .
But we have another more important re@@ ality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
So , when he started wri@@ ting in English , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
This is a re@@ ality that developed socie@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
The G@@ er@@ man@@ s , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Ch@@ in@@ ese , all these na@@ tions are aw@@ are of this .
They ke@@ pt it clo@@ se to them .
You w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a lo@@ cal produc@@ t .
They &apos;d go back to being consu@@ m@@ ers , c@@ lu@@ el@@ ess consu@@ m@@ ers , like we are most of the time .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or le@@ t@@ ters put together .
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better lea@@ ve , and stop talking in va@@ in .
The idea is that these expres@@ si@@ ons re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ co@@ ph@@ one fri@@ end who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her on@@ ce how things were going .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protec@@ t the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ?
E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ ad@@ ac@@ he and go have f@@ un . &quot; &quot; No problem !
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cep@@ t this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ado@@ pt this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be underst@@ o@@ od .
And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I ha@@ te the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our re@@ ality , and be con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed in a way that ref@@ lec@@ ts our dre@@ a@@ ms , as@@ pira@@ tions and da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life .
In a way that d@@ res@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
Af@@ ter that we re@@ lea@@ sed phot@@ os of gu@@ ys and gir@@ ls w@@ ear@@ ing the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c le@@ tter .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; co@@ ol &quot; &quot; gu@@ ys and gir@@ ls .
We are very co@@ ol !
And to who@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ado@@ pt the word &apos; co@@ ol . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ we@@ ver they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and ma@@ t@@ ches the re@@ ality better .
Cre@@ a@@ tivi@@ ty in your mother ton@@ gue is the pa@@ th .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could br@@ ing the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language back to being number one .
But we have to know that , and be con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that a solu@@ tion exist@@ s , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solu@@ tion .
In con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion , what can you do today ?
Now , tw@@ e@@ e@@ ts , who &apos;s tw@@ e@@ e@@ ting ?
But don &apos;t wri@@ te A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c with L@@ a@@ ti@@ n char@@ ac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with nu@@ mb@@ ers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disa@@ s@@ ter ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not e@@ as@@ y to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he coul@@ dn &apos;t take the per@@ spec@@ tive of another person or understand cause and effec@@ t .
In the last 20 years , develo@@ p@@ mental science has comple@@ tely over@@ tur@@ ned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most bri@@ lli@@ ant scienti@@ sts .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figur@@ e out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y .
Af@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ des@@ t for all of us to do is to figur@@ e out what other people are thinking and fe@@ el@@ ing .
And maybe the har@@ des@@ t thing of all is to figur@@ e out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ low@@ ed poli@@ tics can t@@ esti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year@@ -old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ousness mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gue about po@@ ni@@ es and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it tur@@ ns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
What we did — Be@@ tty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my stud@@ ents , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ c@@ kers .
Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cra@@ c@@ kers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
( Laughter ) But then what Be@@ tty did was to take a little tas@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would ac@@ t as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cra@@ c@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other san@@ e person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ mm@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
I tas@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ mm@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cra@@ c@@ kers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k , cra@@ c@@ kers .
I tas@@ ted the cra@@ c@@ kers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d ac@@ t as if what she wanted was just the op@@ posi@@ te of what the bab@@ ies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -old bab@@ ies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?
And the re@@ mar@@ k@@ able thing was that 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -old bab@@ ies , just bar@@ e@@ ly wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cra@@ c@@ kers if she li@@ ked the cra@@ c@@ kers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they coul@@ dn &apos;t figur@@ e this out .
But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cra@@ c@@ kers , what they thought every@@ body must like .
So there are two really re@@ mar@@ k@@ able things about this .
The first one is that these little 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -old bab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human n@@ ature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they fel@@ t that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
E@@ ven more re@@ mar@@ k@@ ab@@ ly though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that these 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human n@@ ature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ or@@ t time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies super@@ fici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty u@@ sel@@ ess .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than u@@ sel@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ e@@ ping them ali@@ ve .
But if we turn to evolu@@ tion for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we s@@ pen@@ d so much time taking care of u@@ sel@@ ess bab@@ ies , it tur@@ ns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ ma@@ tes , but also inclu@@ ding other ma@@ mm@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ an@@ gar@@ o@@ os and wo@@ mb@@ at@@ s , it tur@@ ns out that there &apos;s a rela@@ tion@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are compar@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how s@@ mar@@ t and f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble they are .
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a Ne@@ w C@@ al@@ e@@ don@@ i@@ an cro@@ w .
And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , roo@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incre@@ di@@ bly s@@ mar@@ t bir@@ ds .
They &apos;re as s@@ mar@@ t as ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es in some res@@ pec@@ ts .
And this is a bir@@ d on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
O@@ n the other hand , we have our fri@@ end the do@@ mes@@ tic ch@@ ic@@ ken .
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basi@@ cally as du@@ m@@ b as du@@ mp@@ s .
So they &apos;re very , very good at pec@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it tur@@ ns out that the bab@@ ies , the Ne@@ w C@@ al@@ e@@ don@@ i@@ an cro@@ w bab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ l@@ ings .
They depen@@ d on their mo@@ ms to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bir@@ d .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually ma@@ ture within a cou@@ ple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that see@@ ms to be connec@@ ted to kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ ken , see@@ m to be beauti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ i@@ ted to doing just one thing very well .
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ i@@ ted to pec@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
O@@ ther cre@@ atur@@ es , like the cro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments .
And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion like the cro@@ ws .
We have bi@@ gg@@ er bra@@ ins rela@@ tive to our bo@@ dies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re s@@ mar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , we can learn more , we sur@@ vi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gra@@ ted to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space .
And our bab@@ ies and children are depen@@ d@@ ent on us for much lon@@ ger than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
( Laughter ) And at le@@ ast until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still po@@ p@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths .
All right , why would we see this cor@@ rela@@ tion ?
Well an idea is that that stra@@ te@@ gy , that learning stra@@ te@@ gy , is an extre@@ me@@ ly power@@ ful , great stra@@ te@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ge .
And that one big disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ge is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess .
So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A s@@ l@@ ing@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the ma@@ sto@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evolu@@ tions see@@ ms to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of divi@@ sion of la@@ b@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early peri@@ od when we &apos;re comple@@ tely protec@@ ted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develo@@ p@@ ment divi@@ sion of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protec@@ ted blue sk@@ y gu@@ ys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and mar@@ ke@@ ting .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ fec@@ tive gro@@ w@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develo@@ p@@ mental sta@@ ge of the same species — kind of like ca@@ ter@@ pi@@ ll@@ ar@@ s and bu@@ tter@@ fli@@ es — ex@@ cep@@ t that they &apos;re actually the bri@@ lli@@ ant bu@@ tter@@ fli@@ es who are fli@@ tting around the gar@@ den and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the ca@@ ter@@ pi@@ ll@@ ar@@ s who are in@@ ching al@@ ong our n@@ ar@@ row , gro@@ w@@ n@@ up , adul@@ t pa@@ th .
If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this evolu@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expec@@ t that they would have really power@@ ful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain see@@ ms to be the most power@@ ful learning computer on the plan@@ et .
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ volu@@ tion in our underst@@ an@@ ding of mach@@ ine learning rec@@ ently .
And it all depen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ o@@ mas B@@ a@@ y@@ es , who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ an in the 1@@ 8@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y .
And es@@ senti@@ ally what B@@ a@@ y@@ es did was to pro@@ vi@@ de a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way using probab@@ ili@@ ty the@@ ory to char@@ ac@@ teri@@ ze , descri@@ be , the way that scienti@@ sts find out about the world .
So what scienti@@ sts do is they have a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis that they think might be li@@ ke@@ ly to start with .
They go out and test it aga@@ in@@ st the evi@@ den@@ ce .
The evi@@ den@@ ce makes them change that hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis .
Then they test that new hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ a@@ y@@ es sho@@ w@@ ed was a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics is at the co@@ re of the best mach@@ ine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I su@@ gg@@ es@@ ted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually loo@@ ks something like this .
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos;s no@@ te@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ lica@@ ted cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions with condi@@ tional probab@@ ili@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vi@@ sing to figur@@ e out how the world works .
All right , now that might see@@ m like an even tal@@ ler order to actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te .
Because after all , if you ask even gro@@ w@@ nu@@ ps about sta@@ ti@@ stics , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ pi@@ d .
How could it be that children are doing sta@@ ti@@ stics ?
So to test this we used a mach@@ ine that we have called the B@@ li@@ c@@ ket De@@ tec@@ tor .
This is a bo@@ x that li@@ ghts up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple mach@@ ine , my lab and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world .
Let me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ mar K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my stud@@ ent .
If I sho@@ w@@ ed you this detec@@ tor , you would be li@@ ke@@ ly to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the detec@@ tor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the detec@@ tor .
But actually , this detec@@ tor works in a bit of a st@@ ran@@ ge way .
Because if you wa@@ ve a blo@@ ck over the top of the detec@@ tor , something you w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the detec@@ tor will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the li@@ ke@@ ly thing , put the blo@@ ck on the detec@@ tor , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times .
So the un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis actually has st@@ ron@@ ger evi@@ den@@ ce .
It loo@@ ks as if the wa@@ ving is a more effec@@ tive stra@@ te@@ gy than the other stra@@ te@@ gy .
So we did just this ; we ga@@ ve four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds this pa@@ tter@@ n of evi@@ den@@ ce , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds used the evi@@ den@@ ce to wa@@ ve the ob@@ ject on top of the detec@@ tor .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ lica@@ ted cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions that will give them a condi@@ tional probab@@ ili@@ ty meas@@ ure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evi@@ den@@ ce to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis about the world , that see@@ ms very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to beg@@ in with .
And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis than adul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same tas@@ k .
So in these cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using sta@@ ti@@ stics to find out about the world , but after all , scienti@@ sts also do experi@@ ments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experi@@ ments .
When children do experi@@ ments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pla@@ ying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bun@@ ch of interesting stu@@ dies rec@@ ently that have sho@@ wn this pla@@ ying around is really a kind of experi@@ mental research progra@@ m .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s lab .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ li@@ c@@ ket De@@ tec@@ tors .
And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ w@@ ed them an an@@ o@@ mal@@ y .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ th@@ eses in the space of two minu@@ tes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
Sa@@ me as the other side .
A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis has just been fal@@ si@@ fi@@ ed .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing .
A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experi@@ mental no@@ te@@ book out .
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will recogni@@ ze that expres@@ sion of des@@ pa@@ ir .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this nee@@ ds to be like this , and this nee@@ ds to be like this .
A@@ G : Okay , hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis two .
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experi@@ men@@ ter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ cation .
No@@ t working ei@@ ther .
Bo@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bot@@ to@@ m of this bo@@ x has elec@@ tri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have elec@@ tri@@ city .
A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis .
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis .
Now that is a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly — that is a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ad@@ or@@ able and ar@@ tic@@ u@@ late little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite ty@@ pi@@ cal .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to ex@@ pla@@ in something , what they really do is do a seri@@ es of experi@@ ments .
This is actually pretty ty@@ pi@@ cal of four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these bri@@ lli@@ ant bu@@ tter@@ fli@@ es who can test five hy@@ po@@ th@@ eses in two minu@@ tes ?
Well , if you go back to those p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts and phi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were bar@@ e@@ ly consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all .
And I think just the op@@ posi@@ te is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as adul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adul@@ t consci@@ ousness works .
And adul@@ ts &apos; attention and consci@@ ousness look kind of like a s@@ po@@ t@@ light .
So what happens for adul@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant or important , we should pa@@ y attention to it .
Ou@@ r consci@@ ousness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pa@@ y attention is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a si@@ gn@@ al that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , more pla@@ stic , better at learning , and s@@ hu@@ ts down activi@@ ty in all the res@@ t of our bra@@ ins .
So we have a very fo@@ cu@@ sed , pur@@ pos@@ e@@ -@@ dri@@ ven kind of attention .
If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different .
I think bab@@ ies and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consci@@ ousness than a s@@ po@@ t@@ light of consci@@ ousness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in l@@ ots of information from l@@ ots of different s@@ our@@ ces at on@@ ce .
And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ mi@@ t@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and pla@@ sti@@ city , and the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ory par@@ ts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at pa@@ ying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pa@@ ying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consci@@ ousness , that we might expec@@ t from those bu@@ tter@@ fli@@ es who are desig@@ ned to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a tas@@ te of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ousness as adul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about ca@@ ses where we &apos;re put in a new situ@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ousness contra@@ c@@ ts , it ex@@ pan@@ ds , so that those three days in Par@@ is see@@ m to be more full of consci@@ ousness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ o@@ mbi@@ e back home .
And by the way , that co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , that wonderful co@@ f@@ fe@@ e you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually mi@@ mi@@ cs the effec@@ t of those bab@@ y ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ mi@@ t@@ ters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three dou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ sos .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fan@@ ta@@ stic way to be , but it does ten@@ d to lea@@ ve you wa@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a gro@@ w@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a gro@@ w@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ aces and cro@@ ss the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making bab@@ ies think like adul@@ ts do .
But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ tter@@ fli@@ es , to have op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imag@@ in@@ ation , crea@@ tivi@@ ty , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion , maybe at le@@ ast some of the time we should be getting the adul@@ ts to start thinking more like children .

These are simple ob@@ jects : clo@@ c@@ ks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , g@@ la@@ s@@ ses .
We are all famili@@ ar with these mun@@ dan@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects .
The fact that some of the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed person@@ al i@@ te@@ ms such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te and a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h is a c@@ lear si@@ g@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
These i@@ te@@ ms have been reco@@ vered from nu@@ mer@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves across my ho@@ me@@ land , and as we spe@@ ak , for@@ en@@ si@@ cs are ex@@ hu@@ ming bo@@ dies from ne@@ w@@ ly disco@@ vered ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , 20 years after the w@@ ar .
And it is quite pos@@ si@@ bly the lar@@ g@@ est ever disco@@ vered .
D@@ ur@@ ing the four years of con@@ fli@@ c@@ t that de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ted the Bo@@ s@@ ni@@ an na@@ tion in the early &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 3@@ 0@@ ,000 ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , ma@@ in@@ ly ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans , went mis@@ sing , pres@@ u@@ med k@@ il@@ led , and another 10@@ 0@@ ,000 were k@@ il@@ led dur@@ ing com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations .
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ bun@@ al de@@ li@@ vered a number of s@@ enten@@ ces for cri@@ mes aga@@ in@@ st human@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is a syste@@ ma@@ tic and de@@ liber@@ ate dest@@ r@@ uc@@ tion of a ra@@ cial , poli@@ tical , reli@@ gi@@ ous or e@@ th@@ ni@@ c gro@@ up .
As much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about ki@@ lling .
It is also about dest@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tural her@@ i@@ ta@@ ge , and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely the very no@@ tion that they ever exis@@ ted .
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the ki@@ lling ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed identi@@ ty .
There are always tra@@ ces — no such thing as a perfec@@ t cri@@ me .
There are always re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts of the per@@ is@@ h@@ ed ones that are more du@@ ra@@ ble than their fra@@ gi@@ le bo@@ dies and our se@@ lec@@ tive and f@@ ad@@ ing memor@@ y of them .
These i@@ te@@ ms are reco@@ vered from nu@@ mer@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , and the ma@@ in go@@ al of this col@@ lec@@ tion of the i@@ te@@ ms is a uni@@ que process of identi@@ f@@ ying those who disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in the ki@@ ll@@ ings , the first ac@@ t of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de on Euro@@ pe@@ an so@@ il sin@@ ce the Ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust .
No@@ t a single body should rema@@ in un@@ disco@@ vered or uni@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed .
O@@ n@@ ce reco@@ vered , these i@@ te@@ ms that the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their way to ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion are car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly c@@ le@@ an@@ ed , anal@@ y@@ zed , ca@@ tal@@ o@@ gu@@ ed and sto@@ red .
Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of arti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in whi@@ te pla@@ stic b@@ ag@@ s just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
These ob@@ jects are used as a for@@ en@@ sic to@@ ol in visual identi@@ fi@@ cation of the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms , but they are also used as very valu@@ able for@@ en@@ sic evi@@ den@@ ce in the on@@ going w@@ ar cri@@ mes tri@@ als .
S@@ ur@@ viv@@ ors are oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally called to try to identi@@ f@@ y these i@@ te@@ ms physi@@ cally , but physical bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ me@@ ly dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ t , an in@@ effec@@ tive and pa@@ in@@ ful process .
O@@ n@@ ce the for@@ en@@ si@@ cs and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the n@@ arra@@ tive .
M@@ any of them get dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of si@@ ght and out of mind .
I decided a few years ago to phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h every single ex@@ hu@@ med i@@ te@@ m in order to create a visual ar@@ chi@@ ve that sur@@ viv@@ ors could e@@ asi@@ ly bro@@ w@@ se .
I like to move be@@ y@@ on@@ d ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
And in this case , someone may recogni@@ ze these i@@ te@@ ms or at le@@ ast their phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s will rema@@ in as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ a@@ sed and ac@@ cu@@ rate re@@ min@@ der of what happened .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y is about em@@ path@@ y , and the famili@@ ar@@ ity of these i@@ te@@ ms gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e em@@ path@@ y .
In this case , I am mer@@ e@@ ly a to@@ ol , a for@@ en@@ sic , if you like , and the resul@@ t is a phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y that is as clo@@ se as possible of being a do@@ cu@@ ment .
O@@ n@@ ce all the mis@@ sing per@@ s@@ ons are identi@@ fi@@ ed , only deca@@ ying bo@@ dies in their gra@@ ves and these every@@ day i@@ te@@ ms will rema@@ in .
In all their simp@@ li@@ city , these i@@ te@@ ms are the last t@@ esta@@ ment to the identi@@ ty of the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever exis@@ ted .
Thank you very much .

There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ v@@ ent@@ uro@@ us before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ch@@ al@@ l@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .

I &apos;m here to share my phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y .
O@@ r is it phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y ?
Because , of course , this is a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era .
Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y started as I got my first di@@ gi@@ tal cam@@ era at the age of 15 .
It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead .
And when you take a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h with a cam@@ era , the process ends when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er .
So to me it fel@@ t like phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I fel@@ t like any@@ one could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on al@@ ong a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ expec@@ ted tw@@ ist .
And des@@ pi@@ te that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of re@@ al@@ ism .
O@@ r phot@@ os like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ al@@ ism .
When I say re@@ al@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o@@ -@@ re@@ al@@ ism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figur@@ e out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ u@@ sion ?
So@@ me@@ times the per@@ spec@@ tive is the ill@@ u@@ sion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realiz@@ ed on a tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al sur@@ face .
It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think loo@@ ks re@@ al@@ is@@ tic really .
So I think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of re@@ ality where you can take different pi@@ eces of re@@ ality and put it together to create alter@@ na@@ te re@@ ality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfec@@ tly imag@@ in@@ able physical ob@@ jects , something we all can rela@@ te to living in a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world .
But com@@ bin@@ ed in a cer@@ tain way , they can create something that still loo@@ ks th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , like it could exis@@ t .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cep@@ t the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with com@@ bin@@ ing phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ bin@@ ing different re@@ ali@@ ties .
So the things that make a phot@@ ogra@@ p@@ h look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ i@@ ly lives .
But when com@@ bin@@ ing phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just loo@@ ks wrong some@@ how .
So I would like to say that there are three simple r@@ ul@@ es to fol@@ low to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t .
As you can see , these imag@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t really spe@@ cial .
But com@@ bin@@ ed , they can create something like this .
So the first ru@@ le is that phot@@ os com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same per@@ spec@@ tive .
Se@@ con@@ d@@ ly , phot@@ os com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same ty@@ pe of light .
And these two imag@@ es both ful@@ fi@@ ll these two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The th@@ ird one is about making it im@@ possible to distin@@ gu@@ is@@ h where the different imag@@ es beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it im@@ possible to say how the ima@@ ge actually was com@@ pos@@ ed .
So by ma@@ t@@ ching col@@ or , contra@@ st and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different imag@@ es , ad@@ ding phot@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c de@@ fec@@ ts like de@@ p@@ th of fiel@@ d , des@@ atu@@ ra@@ ted col@@ ors and noi@@ se , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different imag@@ es and make it look like one single ima@@ ge , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that one ima@@ ge can con@@ tain hundre@@ ds of la@@ y@@ ers basi@@ cally .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an ima@@ ge of a lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted .
But this ima@@ ge is actually enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ pos@@ ed of phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s from different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s e@@ asi@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se with the ideas in your head .
But it does re@@ qui@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
And getting this idea dur@@ ing win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pla@@ n it , to find the different lo@@ ca@@ tions for the pi@@ eces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basi@@ cally .
So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p .
The sh@@ ores are from a different lo@@ cation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
And ye@@ ah , I even tur@@ ned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h .
So to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning .
It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about com@@ bin@@ ing the different phot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the phot@@ os , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that limi@@ ts us is our imag@@ in@@ ation .
Thank you .
